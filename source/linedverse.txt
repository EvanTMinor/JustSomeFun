001:001 This is the Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave him  to show to his servants the things which must happen soon,  which he sent and made known by his angel{or, messenger  (here and wherever angel is mentioned)} to his servant, John,
001:002 who testified to God's word, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ,  about everything that he saw.
001:003 Blessed is he who reads and those who hear the words of  the prophecy, and keep the things that are written in it,  for the time is at hand.
001:004 John, to the seven assemblies that are in Asia:  Grace to you  and peace, from God, who is and who was and who is to come;  and from the seven Spirits who are before his throne;
001:005 and from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the firstborn  of the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth.  To him who loves us, and washed us from our sins by his blood;
001:006 and he made us to be a Kingdom, priests{Exodus 19:6;  Isaiah 61:6} to his God and Father; to him be the glory  and the dominion forever and ever.  Amen.
001:007 Behold, he is coming with the clouds, and every eye will see him,  including those who pierced him.  All the tribes of the earth  will mourn over him.  Even so, Amen.
001:008 "I am the Alpha and the Omega,{TR adds "the Beginning and the End"}"  says the Lord God,{TR omits "God"} "who is and who was and  who is to come, the Almighty."
001:009 I John, your brother and partner with you in oppression,  Kingdom, and perseverance in Christ Jesus, was on the isle  that is called Patmos because of God's Word and the testimony  of Jesus Christ.
001:010 I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and I heard behind me  a loud voice, like a trumpet
001:011 saying, "{TR adds "I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First  and the Last."}What you see, write in a book and send  to the seven assemblies{TR adds "which are in Asia"}:  to Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia,  and to Laodicea."
001:012 I turned to see the voice that spoke with me.  Having turned,  I saw seven golden lampstands.
001:013 And among the lampstands was one like a son of man,{Daniel
001:014 His head and his hair were white as white wool, like snow.  His eyes were like a flame of fire.
001:015 His feet were like burnished brass, as if it had been refined  in a furnace.  His voice was like the voice of many waters.
001:016 He had seven stars in his right hand.  Out of his mouth proceeded  a sharp two-edged sword.  His face was like the sun shining  at its brightest.
001:017 When I saw him, I fell at his feet like a dead man.  He laid his right hand on me, saying, "Don't be afraid.  I am the first and the last,
001:018 and the Living one.  I was dead, and behold, I am  alive forevermore.  Amen.  I have the keys of Death and  of Hades{or, Hell}.
001:019 Write therefore the things which you have seen, and the things  which are, and the things which will happen hereafter;
001:020 the mystery of the seven stars which you saw in my right hand,  and the seven golden lampstands.  The seven stars are  the angels{or, messengers (here and wherever angels are  mentioned)} of the seven assemblies.  The seven lampstands  are seven assemblies.
001:021 Keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy  of our Lord Jesus Christ to eternal life.
001:022 On some have compassion, making a distinction,
001:023 and some save, snatching them out of the fire with fear,  hating even the clothing stained by the flesh.
001:024 Now to him who is able to keep them{TR and NU read "you"}  from stumbling, and to present you faultless before the presence  of his glory in great joy,
001:025 to God our Savior, who alone is wise, be glory and majesty,  dominion and power, both now and forever.  Amen.Book 66 Revelation
001:026 If anyone among you thinks himself to be religious while  he doesn't bridle his tongue, but deceives his heart,  this man's religion is worthless.
001:027 Pure religion and undefiled before our God and Father is this:  to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction,  and to keep oneself unstained by the world.
001:028 whom we proclaim, admonishing every man and teaching every  man in all wisdom, that we may present every man perfect  in Christ Jesus;
001:029 for which I also labor, striving according to his working,  which works in me mightily.
001:030 having the same conflict which you saw in me, and now hear  is in me.
001:031 that, according as it is written, "He who boasts, let him  boast in the Lord."{Jeremiah 9:24}
002:001 "To the angel of the assembly in Ephesus write:  "He who holds the seven stars in his right hand, he who walks  among the seven golden lampstands says these things:
002:002 "I know your works, and your toil and perseverance, and that  you can't tolerate evil men, and have tested those who call  themselves apostles, and they are not, and found them false.
002:003 You have perseverance and have endured for my name's sake,  and have{TR adds "have labored and"} not grown weary.
002:004 But I have this against you, that you left your first love.
002:005 Remember therefore from where you have fallen, and repent  and do the first works; or else I am coming to you swiftly,  and will move your lampstand out of its place, unless you repent.
002:006 But this you have, that you hate the works of the Nicolaitans,  which I also hate.
002:007 He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to  the assemblies.  To him who overcomes I will give to eat  of the tree of life, which is in the Paradise of my God.
002:008 "To the angel of the assembly in Smyrna write:  "The first and the last, who was dead, and has come to life  says these things:
002:009 "I know your works, oppression, and your poverty (but you  are rich), and the blasphemy of those who say they are Jews,  and they are not, but are a synagogue of Satan.
002:010 Don't be afraid of the things which you are about to suffer.  Behold, the devil is about to throw some of you into prison,  that you may be tested; and you will have oppression for ten days.  Be faithful to death, and I will give you the crown of life.
002:011 He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says  to the assemblies.  He who overcomes won't be harmed by  the second death.
002:012 "To the angel of the assembly in Pergamum write:  "He who has the sharp two-edged sword says these things:
002:013 "I know your works and where you dwell, where Satan's throne is.  You hold firmly to my name, and didn't deny my faith in the days  of Antipas my witness, my faithful one, who was killed among you,  where Satan dwells.
002:014 But I have a few things against you, because you have there  some who hold the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to throw  a stumbling block before the children of Israel, to eat things  sacrificed to idols, and to commit sexual immorality.
002:015 So you also have some who hold to the teaching  of the Nicolaitans likewise{TR reads "which I hate"  instead of "likewise"}.
002:016 Repent therefore, or else I am coming to you quickly, and I  will make war against them with the sword of my mouth.
002:017 He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to  the assemblies.  To him who overcomes, to him I will give  of the hidden manna,{Manna is supernatural food, named after  the Hebrew for "What is it?". See Exodus 11:7-9.} and I will  give him a white stone, and on the stone a new name written,  which no one knows but he who receives it.
002:018 "To the angel of the assembly in Thyatira write:  "The Son of God, who has his eyes like a flame of fire,  and his feet are like burnished brass, says these things:
002:019 "I know your works, your love, faith, service, patient endurance,  and that your last works are more than the first.
002:020 But I have this against you, that you tolerate your{TR, NU read "that"  instead of "your"} woman, Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess.  She teaches and seduces my servants to commit sexual immorality,  and to eat things sacrificed to idols.
002:021 I gave her time to repent, but she refuses to repent of  her sexual immorality.
002:022 Behold, I will throw her into a bed, and those who commit  adultery with her into great oppression, unless they repent  of her works.
002:023 I will kill her children with Death, and all the assemblies  will know that I am he who searches the minds and hearts.  I will give to each one of you according to your deeds.
002:024 But to you I say, to the rest who are in Thyatira, as many  as don't have this teaching, who don't know what some call  'the deep things of Satan,' to you I say, I am not putting  any other burden on you.
002:025 Nevertheless, hold firmly that which you have, until I come.
003:001 "And to the angel of the assembly in Sardis write:  "He who has  the seven Spirits of God, and the seven stars says these things:  "I know your works, that you have a reputation of being alive,  but you are dead.
003:002 Wake up, and keep the things that remain, which you were about  to throw away, for I have found no works of yours perfected  before my God.
003:003 Remember therefore how you have received and heard.  Keep it, and repent.  If therefore you won't watch, I will come  as a thief, and you won't know what hour I will come upon you.
003:004 Nevertheless you have a few names in Sardis that did not  defile their garments.  They will walk with me in white,  for they are worthy.
003:005 He who overcomes will be arrayed in white garments, and I  will in no way blot his name out of the book of life, and I  will confess his name before my Father, and before his angels.
003:006 He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says  to the assemblies.
003:007 "To the angel of the assembly in Philadelphia write:  "He who is holy, he who is true, he who has the key of David,  he who opens and no one can shut, and who shuts and no one opens,  says these things:
003:008 "I know your works (behold, I have set before you an open door,  which no one can shut), that you have a little power,  and kept my word, and didn't deny my name.
003:009 Behold, I give of the synagogue of Satan, of those who say they  are Jews, and they are not, but lie.  Behold, I will make  them to come and worship before your feet, and to know that I  have loved you.
003:010 Because you kept my command to endure, I also will keep you  from the hour of testing, which is to come on the whole world,  to test those who dwell on the earth.
003:011 I am coming quickly!  Hold firmly that which you have,  so that no one takes your crown.
003:012 He who overcomes, I will make him a pillar in the temple of my God,  and he will go out from there no more.  I will write on him  the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God,  the new Jerusalem, which comes down out of heaven from my God,  and my own new name.
003:013 He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says  to the assemblies.
003:014 "To the angel of the assembly in Laodicea write:  "The Amen,  the Faithful and True Witness, the Head of God's creation,  says these things:
003:015 "I know your works, that you are neither cold nor hot.  I wish you were cold or hot.
003:016 So, because you are lukewarm, and neither hot nor cold,  I will vomit you out of my mouth.
003:017 Because you say, 'I am rich, and have gotten riches,  and have need of nothing;' and don't know that you are  the wretched one, miserable, poor, blind, and naked;
003:018 I counsel you to buy from me gold refined by fire, that you may  become rich; and white garments, that you may clothe yourself,  and that the shame of your nakedness may not be revealed;  and eye salve to anoint your eyes, that you may see.
003:019 As many as I love, I reprove and chasten.  Be zealous therefore,  and repent.
003:020 Behold, I stand at the door and knock.  If anyone hears  my voice and opens the door, then I will come in to him,  and will dine with him, and he with me.
003:021 He who overcomes, I will give to him to sit down with me on  my throne, as I also overcame, and sat down with my Father  on his throne.
003:022 He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says  to the assemblies."
003:023 This is his commandment, that we should believe in  the name of his Son, Jesus Christ, and love one another,  even as he commanded.
003:024 He who keeps his commandments remains in him, and he in him.  By this we know that he remains in us, by the Spirit which  he gave us.
004:001 After these things I looked and saw a door opened in heaven,  and the first voice that I heard, like a trumpet speaking  with me, was one saying, "Come up here, and I will show you  the things which must happen after this."
004:002 Immediately I was in the Spirit.  Behold, there was a throne  set in heaven, and one sitting on the throne
004:003 that looked like a jasper stone and a sardius.  There was  a rainbow around the throne, like an emerald to look at.
004:004 Around the throne were twenty-four thrones.  On the thrones  were twenty-four elders sitting, dressed in white garments,  with crowns of gold on their heads.
004:005 Out of the throne proceed lightnings, sounds, and thunders.  There were seven lamps of fire burning before his throne,  which are the seven Spirits of God.
004:006 Before the throne was something like a sea of glass, similar  to crystal.  In the midst of the throne, and around the throne  were four living creatures full of eyes before and behind.
004:007 The first creature was like a lion, and the second creature  like a calf, and the third creature had a face like a man,  and the fourth was like a flying eagle.
004:008 The four living creatures, each one of them having six wings,  are full of eyes around about and within.  They have no rest day  and night, saying, "Holy, holy, holy{Hodges/Farstad MT reads "holy"  9 times instead of 3.} is the Lord God, the Almighty,  who was and who is and who is to come!"
004:009 When the living creatures give glory, honor, and thanks to him  who sits on the throne, to him who lives forever and ever,
004:010 the twenty-four elders fall down before him who sits on  the throne, and worship him who lives forever and ever,  and throw their crowns before the throne, saying,
004:011 "Worthy are you, our Lord and God, the Holy One,{TR omits  "and God, the Holy One,"} to receive the glory, the honor,  and the power, for you created all things, and because of your  desire they existed, and were created!"
004:012 No one has seen God at any time.  If we love one another,  God remains in us, and his love has been perfected in us.
004:013 By this we know that we remain in him and he in us,  because he has given us of his Spirit.
004:014 We have seen and testify that the Father has sent the Son  as the Savior of the world.
004:015 Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God remains  in him, and he in God.
004:016 We know and have believed the love which God has for us.  God is love, and he who remains in love remains in God,  and God remains in him.
004:017 In this love has been made perfect among us, that we may  have boldness in the day of judgment, because as he is,  even so are we in this world.
004:018 There is no fear in love; but perfect love casts out fear,  because fear has punishment.  He who fears is not made  perfect in love.
004:019 We love Him, because he first loved us.
004:020 If a man says, "I love God," and hates his brother, he is a liar;  for he who doesn't love his brother whom he has seen,  how can he love God whom he has not seen?
004:021 This commandment we have from him, that he who loves God  should also love his brother.
004:022 The Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.  Grace be  with you.  Amen.Book 56 Titus
004:023 The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.  Amen.Book 51 Colossians
004:024 and put on the new man, who in the likeness of God has been  created in righteousness and holiness of truth.
004:025 Therefore, putting away falsehood, speak truth each one with  his neighbor.  For we are members of one another.
004:026 "Be angry, and don't sin."{Psalm 4:4} Don't let the sun go  down on your wrath,
005:001 I saw, in the right hand of him who sat on the throne, a book  written inside and outside, sealed shut with seven seals.
005:002 I saw a mighty angel proclaiming with a loud voice, "Who is  worthy to open the book, and to break its seals?"
005:003 No one in heaven above, or on the earth, or under the earth,  was able to open the book, or to look in it.
005:004 And I wept much, because no one was found worthy to open the book,  or to look in it.
005:005 One of the elders said to me, "Don't weep.  Behold, the Lion  who is of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has overcome;  he who opens the book and its seven seals."
005:006 I saw in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures,  and in the midst of the elders, a Lamb standing, as though  it had been slain, having seven horns, and seven eyes,  which are the seven Spirits of God, sent out into all the earth.
005:007 Then he came, and he took it out of the right hand of him  who sat on the throne.
005:008 Now when he had taken the book, the four living creatures  and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb,  each one having a harp, and golden bowls full of incense,  which are the prayers of the saints.
005:009 They sang a new song, saying, "You are worthy to take the book,  and to open its seals:  for you were killed, and bought us for God  with your blood, out of every tribe, language, people, and nation,
005:010 and made us kings and priests to our God, and we will  reign on earth."
005:011 I saw, and I heard something like a voice of many angels  around the throne, the living creatures, and the elders;  and the number of them was ten thousands of ten thousands,  and thousands of thousands;
005:012 saying with a loud voice, "Worthy is the Lamb who has been  killed to receive the power, wealth, wisdom, strength, honor,  glory, and blessing!"
005:013 I heard every created thing which is in heaven, on the earth,  under the earth, on the sea, and everything in them, saying,  "To him who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb be the blessing,  the honor, the glory, and the dominion, forever and ever!  Amen!{TR omits "Amen!"}"
005:014 The four living creatures said, "Amen!"  The {TR adds  "twenty-four"}elders fell down and worshiped.{TR adds "the  one living forever and ever"}
005:015 And if we know that he listens to us, whatever we ask, we know  that we have the petitions which we have asked of him.
005:016 If anyone sees his brother sinning a sin not leading to death,  he shall ask, and God will give him life for those who sin  not leading to death.  There is a sin leading to death.  I don't say that he should make a request concerning this.
005:017 All unrighteousness is sin, and there is a sin not leading to death.
005:018 We know that whoever is born of God doesn't sin, but he who was  born of God keeps himself, and the evil one doesn't touch him.
005:019 We know that we are of God, and the whole world lies in the power  of the evil one.
005:020 We know that the Son of God has come, and has given  us an understanding, that we know him who is true,  and we are in him who is true, in his Son Jesus Christ.  This is the true God, and eternal life.
005:021 Little children, keep yourselves from idols.Book 63 2 John
005:022 Lay hands hastily on no one, neither be a participant in other  men's sins.  Keep yourself pure.
005:023 Be no longer a drinker of water only, but use a little wine  for your stomach's sake and your frequent infirmities.
005:024 Some men's sins are evident, preceding them to judgment,  and some also follow later.
005:025 In the same way also there are good works that are obvious,  and those that are otherwise can't be hidden.
005:026 Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss.
005:027 I solemnly charge you by the Lord that this letter be read  to all the holy brothers.
005:028 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.  Amen.Book 53 2 Thessalonians
005:029 For no man ever hated his own flesh; but nourishes and cherishes it,  even as the Lord also does the assembly;
005:030 because we are members of his body, of his flesh and bones.
005:031 "For this cause a man will leave his father and mother,  and will be joined to his wife.  The two will become  one flesh."{Genesis 2:24}
005:032 This mystery is great, but I speak concerning Christ and  of the assembly.
006:001 I saw that the Lamb opened one of the seven seals, and I heard  one of the four living creatures saying, as with a voice  of thunder, "Come and see!"
006:002 And behold, a white horse, and he who sat on it had a bow.  A crown was given to him, and he came forth conquering,  and to conquer.
006:003 When he opened the second seal, I heard the second living  creature saying, "Come!"
006:004 Another came forth, a red horse.  To him who sat on it was given  power to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill  one another.  There was given to him a great sword.
006:005 When he opened the third seal, I heard the third living  creature saying, "Come and see!"  And behold, a black horse,  and he who sat on it had a balance in his hand.
006:006 I heard a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying,  "A choenix{A choenix is a dry volume measure that is a little  more than a litre (a little more than a quart).} of wheat  for a denarius, and three choenix of barley for a denarius!  Don't damage the oil and the wine!"
006:007 When he opened the fourth seal, I heard the fourth living  creature saying, "Come and see!"
006:008 And behold, a pale horse, and he who sat on it,  his name was Death.  Hades{or, Hell} followed with him.  Authority over one fourth of the earth, to kill with the sword,  with famine, with death, and by the wild animals of the earth  was given to him.
006:009 When he opened the fifth seal, I saw underneath the altar  the souls of those who had been killed for the Word of God,  and for the testimony of the Lamb which they had.
006:010 They cried with a loud voice, saying, "How long, Master, the holy  and true, until you judge and avenge our blood on those who  dwell on the earth?"
006:011 A long white robe was given to each of them.  They were told  that they should rest yet for a while, until their fellow servants  and their brothers,{The word for "brothers" here and where context  allows may also be correctly translated "brothers and sisters"  or "siblings."} who would also be killed even as they were,  should complete their course.
006:012 I saw when he opened the sixth seal, and there was a  great earthquake.  The sun became black as sackcloth made  of hair, and the whole moon became as blood.
006:013 The stars of the sky fell to the earth, like a fig tree dropping  its unripe figs when it is shaken by a great wind.
006:014 The sky was removed like a scroll when it is rolled up.  Every mountain and island were moved out of their places.
006:015 The kings of the earth, the princes, the commanding officers,  the rich, the strong, and every slave and free person,  hid themselves in the caves and in the rocks of the mountains.
006:016 They told the mountains and the rocks, "Fall on us,  and hide us from the face of him who sits on the throne,  and from the wrath of the Lamb,
006:017 for the great day of his wrath has come; and who is able to stand?"
006:018 that by two immutable things, in which it is impossible for God  to lie, we may have a strong encouragement, who have fled  for refuge to take hold of the hope set before us.
006:019 This hope we have as an anchor of the soul, a hope both sure  and steadfast and entering into that which is within the veil;
006:020 where as a forerunner Jesus entered for us, having become  a high priest forever after the order of Melchizedek.
006:021 which some professing have erred concerning the faith.  Grace be with you.  Amen.Book 55 2 Timothy
006:022 whom I have sent to you for this very purpose, that you may  know our state, and that he may comfort your hearts.
007:001 After this, I saw four angels standing at the four corners  of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth,  so that no wind would blow on the earth, or on the sea,  or on any tree.
007:002 I saw another angel ascend from the sunrise, having the seal  of the living God.  He cried with a loud voice to the four  angels to whom it was given to harm the earth and the sea,
007:003 saying, "Don't harm the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees,  until we have sealed the bondservants of our God  on their foreheads!"
007:004 I heard the number of those who were sealed, one hundred  forty-four thousand, sealed out of every tribe of the  children of Israel:
007:005 of the tribe of Judah were sealed twelve thousand, of the tribe  of Reuben twelve thousand, of the tribe of Gad twelve thousand,
007:006 of the tribe of Asher twelve thousand, of the tribe of Naphtali  twelve thousand, of the tribe of Manasseh twelve thousand,
007:007 of the tribe of Simeon twelve thousand, of the tribe of Levi  twelve thousand, of the tribe of Issachar twelve thousand,
007:008 of the tribe of Zebulun twelve thousand, of the tribe  of Joseph twelve thousand, of the tribe of Benjamin were  sealed twelve thousand.
007:009 After these things I looked, and behold, a great multitude,  which no man could number, out of every nation and of  all tribes, peoples, and languages, standing before the throne  and before the Lamb, dressed in white robes, with palm branches  in their hands.
007:010 They cried with a loud voice, saying, "Salvation be to our God,  who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb!"
007:011 All the angels were standing around the throne, the elders,  and the four living creatures; and they fell on their faces  before his throne, and worshiped God,
007:012 saying, "Amen!  Blessing, glory, wisdom, thanksgiving, honor, power,  and might, be to our God forever and ever!  Amen."
007:013 One of the elders answered, saying to me, "These who are arrayed  in white robes, who are they, and from where did they come?"
007:014 I told him, "My lord, you know."  He said to me,  "These are those who came out of the great tribulation.  They washed their robes, and made them white in the Lamb's blood.
007:015 Therefore they are before the throne of God, they serve him  day and night in his temple.  He who sits on the throne  will spread his tent over them.
007:016 They will never be hungry, neither thirsty any more;  neither will the sun beat on them, nor any heat;
007:017 for the Lamb who is in the midst of the throne shepherds them,  and leads them to springs of waters of life.  And God will  wipe away every tear from their eyes."
007:018 For there is an annulling of a foregoing commandment because  of its weakness and uselessness
007:019 (for the law made nothing perfect), and a bringing in of a  better hope, through which we draw near to God.
007:020 Inasmuch as he was not made priest without the taking of an oath
007:021 (for they indeed have been made priests without an oath),  but he with an oath by him that says of him, "The Lord swore  and will not change his mind, 'You are a priest forever,  according to the order of Melchizedek.'"{Psalm 110:4}
007:022 By so much, Jesus has become the collateral of a better covenant.
007:023 Many, indeed, have been made priests, because they are hindered  from continuing by death.
007:024 But he, because he lives forever, has his priesthood unchangeable.
008:001 When he opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven  for about half an hour.
008:002 I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and seven trumpets  were given to them.
008:003 Another angel came and stood over the altar, having a golden censer.  Much incense was given to him, that he should add it to  the prayers of all the saints on the golden altar which was  before the throne.
008:004 The smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints,  went up before God out of the angel's hand.
008:005 The angel took the censer, and he filled it with the fire of  the altar, and threw it on the earth.  There followed thunders,  sounds, lightnings, and an earthquake.
008:006 The seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared  themselves to sound.
008:007 The first sounded, and there followed hail and fire,  mixed with blood, and they were thrown to the earth.  One third of the earth was burnt up,{TR omits "One third  of the earth was burnt up"} and one third of the trees were  burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up.
008:008 The second angel sounded, and something like a great burning mountain  was thrown into the sea.  One third of the sea became blood,
008:009 and one third of the living creatures which were in the sea died.  One third of the ships were destroyed.
008:010 The third angel sounded, and a great star fell from the sky,  burning like a torch, and it fell on one third of the rivers,  and on the springs of the waters.
008:011 The name of the star is called "Wormwood." One third of the  waters became wormwood.  Many people died from the waters,  because they were made bitter.
008:012 The fourth angel sounded, and one third of the sun was struck,  and one third of the moon, and one third of the stars;  so that one third of them would be darkened, and the day wouldn't  shine for one third of it, and the night in the same way.
008:013 I saw, and I heard an eagle,{TR reads "angel"  instead of "eagle"} flying in mid heaven, saying with a  loud voice, "Woe!  Woe!  Woe for those who dwell on the earth,  because of the other voices of the trumpets of the three angels,  who are yet to sound!"
008:014 but for equality.  Your abundance at this present time supplies  their lack, that their abundance also may become a supply  for your lack; that there may be equality.
008:015 As it is written, "He who gathered much had nothing left over,  and he who gathered little had no lack."{Exodus 16:8}
008:016 But thanks be to God, who puts the same earnest care for you  into the heart of Titus.
008:017 For he indeed accepted our exhortation, but being himself  very earnest, he went out to you of his own accord.
008:018 We have sent together with him the brother whose praise  in the Good News is known through all the assemblies.
008:019 Not only so, but who was also appointed by the assemblies  to travel with us in this grace, which is served by us  to the glory of the Lord himself, and to show our readiness.
008:020 We are avoiding this, that any man should blame us concerning  this abundance which is administered by us.
008:021 Having regard for honorable things, not only in the sight  of the Lord, but also in the sight of men.
008:022 We have sent with them our brother, whom we have many times  proved earnest in many things, but now much more earnest,  by reason of the great confidence which he has in you.
009:001 The fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star from the sky which  had fallen to the earth.  The key to the pit of the abyss  was given to him.
009:002 He opened the pit of the abyss, and smoke went up out of the pit,  like the smoke from a{TR adds "great"} burning furnace.  The sun and the air were darkened because of the smoke  from the pit.
009:003 Then out of the smoke came forth locusts on the earth, and power  was given to them, as the scorpions of the earth have power.
009:004 They were told that they should not hurt the grass of the earth,  neither any green thing, neither any tree, but only those people  who don't have God's seal on their foreheads.
009:005 They were given power not to kill them, but to torment them for  five months.  Their torment was like the torment of a scorpion,  when it strikes a person.
009:006 In those days people will seek death, and will in no way find it.  They will desire to die, and death will flee from them.
009:007 The shapes of the locusts were like horses prepared for war.  On their heads were something like golden crowns, and their  faces were like people's faces.
009:008 They had hair like women's hair, and their teeth were like  those of lions.
009:009 They had breastplates, like breastplates of iron.  The sound of their wings was like the sound of chariots,  or of many horses rushing to war.
009:010 They have tails like those of scorpions, and stings.  In their tails they have power to harm men for five months.
009:011 They have over them as king the angel of the abyss.  His name in Hebrew is "Abaddon,"{"Abaddon" is a Hebrew word that  means ruin, destruction, or the place of destruction} but in Greek,  he has the name "Apollyon."{"Apollyon" means "Destroyer."}
009:012 The first woe is past.  Behold, there are still two woes  coming after this.
009:013 The sixth angel sounded.  I heard a voice from the horns  of the golden altar which is before God,
009:014 saying to the sixth angel who had one trumpet, "Free the four  angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates!"
009:015 The four angels were freed who had been prepared for that hour  and day and month and year, so that they might kill one  third of mankind.
009:016 The number of the armies of the horsemen was two hundred  million{literally, "ten thousands of ten thousands"}. I heard  the number of them.
009:017 Thus I saw the horses in the vision, and those who sat on them,  having breastplates of fiery red, hyacinth blue, and sulfur yellow;  and the heads of lions.  Out of their mouths proceed fire,  smoke, and sulfur.
009:018 By these three plagues were one third of mankind killed:  by the fire, the smoke, and the sulfur, which proceeded out  of their mouths.
009:019 For the power of the horses is in their mouths, and in their tails.  For their tails are like serpents, and have heads, and with  them they harm.
009:020 The rest of mankind, who were not killed with these plagues,  didn't repent of the works of their hands, that they wouldn't  worship demons, and the idols of gold, and of silver,  and of brass, and of stone, and of wood; which can neither see,  nor hear, nor walk.
009:021 They didn't repent of their murders, nor of their sorceries,{The  word for "sorceries" (pharmakeia) also implies the use  of potions, poisons, and drugs} nor of their sexual immorality,  nor of their thefts.
009:022 According to the law, nearly everything is cleansed with blood,  and apart from shedding of blood there is no remission.
009:023 It was necessary therefore that the copies of the things  in the heavens should be cleansed with these; but the heavenly  things themselves with better sacrifices than these.
009:024 For Christ hasn't entered into holy places made with hands,  which are representations of the true, but into heaven itself,  now to appear in the presence of God for us;
009:025 nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest  enters into the holy place year by year with blood not his own,
009:026 or else he must have suffered often since the foundation  of the world.  But now once at the end of the ages, he has  been revealed to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.
009:027 Inasmuch as it is appointed for men to die once,  and after this, judgment,
009:028 so Christ also, having been offered once to bear the sins of many,  will appear a second time, without sin, to those who are  eagerly waiting for him for salvation.
009:029 As Isaiah has said before, "Unless the Lord of Armies{Greek: Sabaoth  (for Hebrew:  Tze'va'ot)} had left us a seed, we would have become  like Sodom, and would have been made like Gomorrah."{Isaiah 1:9}
010:001 I saw a mighty angel coming down out of the sky, clothed with  a cloud.  A rainbow was on his head.  His face was like the sun,  and his feet like pillars of fire.
010:002 He had in his hand a little open book.  He set his right foot  on the sea, and his left on the land.
010:003 He cried with a loud voice, as a lion roars.  When he cried,  the seven thunders uttered their voices.
010:004 When the seven thunders sounded, I was about to write;  but I heard a voice from the sky saying, "Seal up the things  which the seven thunders said, and don't write them."
010:005 The angel who I saw standing on the sea and on the land lifted  up his right hand to the sky,
010:006 and swore by him who lives forever and ever, who created heaven  and the things that are in it, the earth and the things  that are in it, and the sea and the things that are in it,  that there will no longer be delay,
010:007 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he is  about to sound, then the mystery of God is finished,  as he declared to his servants, the prophets.
010:008 The voice which I heard from heaven, again speaking with me,  said, "Go, take the book which is open in the hand of the angel  who stands on the sea and on the land."
010:009 I went to the angel, telling him to give me the little book.  He said to me, "Take it, and eat it up.  It will make your  stomach bitter, but in your mouth it will be as sweet as honey."
010:010 I took the little book out of the angel's hand, and ate it up.  It was as sweet as honey in my mouth.  When I had eaten it,  my stomach was made bitter.
010:011 They told me, "You must prophesy again over many peoples,  nations, languages, and kings."
010:012 but he, when he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever,  sat down on the right hand of God;
010:013 from that time waiting until his enemies are made the footstool  of his feet.
010:014 For by one offering he has perfected forever those who  are being sanctified.
010:015 The Holy Spirit also testifies to us, for after saying,
010:016 "This is the covenant that I will make with them:  'After those days,' says the Lord, 'I will put my laws on  their heart, I will also write them on their mind;'"{Jeremiah  31:33} then he says,
010:017 "I will remember their sins and their iniquities  no more."{Jeremiah 31:34}
010:018 Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin.
010:019 Having therefore, brothers, boldness to enter into the holy  place by the blood of Jesus,
010:020 by the way which he dedicated for us, a new and living way,  through the veil, that is to say, his flesh;
010:021 and having a great priest over the house of God,
010:022 let's draw near with a true heart in fullness of faith,  having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience,  and having our body washed with pure water,
010:023 let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering;  for he who promised is faithful.
010:024 Let us consider how to provoke one another to love and good works,
010:025 not forsaking our own assembling together, as the custom  of some is, but exhorting one another; and so much the more,  as you see the Day approaching.
010:026 For if we sin willfully after we have received the knowledge  of the truth, there remains no more a sacrifice for sins,
010:027 but a certain fearful expectation of judgment, and a fierceness  of fire which will devour the adversaries.
010:028 A man who disregards Moses' law dies without compassion on  the word of two or three witnesses.
010:029 How much worse punishment, do you think, will he be judged  worthy of, who has trodden under foot the Son of God, and has  counted the blood of the covenant with which he was sanctified  an unholy thing, and has insulted the Spirit of grace?
010:030 For we know him who said, "Vengeance belongs to me,"  says the Lord, "I will repay."{Deuteronomy 32:35} Again, "The Lord  will judge his people."{Deuteronomy 32:36; Psalm 135:14}
010:031 It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
010:032 But remember the former days, in which, after you were enlightened,  you endured a great struggle with sufferings;
011:001 A reed like a rod was given to me.  Someone said, "Rise, and measure  God's temple, and the altar, and those who worship in it.
011:002 Leave out the court which is outside of the temple,  and don't measure it, for it has been given to the nations.  They will tread the holy city under foot for forty-two months.
011:003 I will give power to my two witnesses, and they will prophesy  one thousand two hundred sixty days, clothed in sackcloth."
011:004 These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands,  standing before the Lord of the earth.
011:005 If anyone desires to harm them, fire proceeds out of their mouth  and devours their enemies.  If anyone desires to harm them,  he must be killed in this way.
011:006 These have the power to shut up the sky, that it may not rain  during the days of their prophecy.  They have power over  the waters, to turn them into blood, and to strike the earth  with every plague, as often as they desire.
011:007 When they have finished their testimony, the beast that comes up  out of the abyss will make war with them, and overcome them,  and kill them.
011:008 Their dead bodies will be in the street of the great city,  which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also their  Lord was crucified.
011:009 From among the peoples, tribes, languages, and nations people  will look at their dead bodies for three and a half days,  and will not allow their dead bodies to be laid in a tomb.
011:010 Those who dwell on the earth rejoice over them, and they will  be glad.  They will give gifts to one another, because these  two prophets tormented those who dwell on the earth.
011:011 After the three and a half days, the breath of life from  God entered into them, and they stood on their feet.  Great fear fell on those who saw them.
011:012 I heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them, "Come up here!"  They went up into heaven in the cloud, and their enemies saw them.
011:013 In that day there was a great earthquake, and a tenth of the  city fell.  Seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake,  and the rest were terrified, and gave glory to the God of heaven.
011:014 The second woe is past.  Behold, the third woe comes quickly.
011:015 The seventh angel sounded, and great voices in heaven followed,  saying, "The kingdom of the world has become the Kingdom of  our Lord, and of his Christ.  He will reign forever and ever!"
011:016 The twenty-four elders, who sit on their thrones before God's throne,  fell on their faces and worshiped God,
011:017 saying:  "We give you thanks, Lord God, the Almighty,  the one who is and who was{TR adds "and who is coming"};  because you have taken your great power, and reigned.
011:018 The nations were angry, and your wrath came, as did the time  for the dead to be judged, and to give your bondservants  the prophets, their reward, as well as to the saints,  and those who fear your name, to the small and the great;  and to destroy those who destroy the earth."
011:019 God's temple that is in heaven was opened, and the ark of the Lord's  covenant was seen in his temple.  Lightnings, sounds, thunders,  an earthquake, and great hail followed.
011:020 By faith, Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau, even concerning  things to come.
011:021 By faith, Jacob, when he was dying, blessed each of the sons  of Joseph, and worshiped, leaning on the top of his staff.
011:022 By faith, Joseph, when his end was near, made mention of  the departure of the children of Israel; and gave instructions  concerning his bones.
011:023 By faith, Moses, when he was born, was hidden for three months  by his parents, because they saw that he was a beautiful child,  and they were not afraid of the king's commandment.
011:024 By faith, Moses, when he had grown up, refused to be called  the son of Pharaoh's daughter,
011:025 choosing rather to share ill treatment with God's people,  than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a time;
011:026 accounting the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures  of Egypt; for he looked to the reward.
011:027 By faith, he left Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king;  for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible.
011:028 By faith, he kept the Passover, and the sprinkling of the blood,  that the destroyer of the firstborn should not touch them.
011:029 By faith, they passed through the Red Sea as on dry land.  When the Egyptians tried to do so, they were swallowed up.
011:030 By faith, the walls of Jericho fell down, after they had been  encircled for seven days.
011:031 By faith, Rahab the prostitute, didn't perish with those who  were disobedient, having received the spies in peace.
011:032 What more shall I say?  For the time would fail me if I told  of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David, Samuel, and the prophets;
012:001 A great sign was seen in heaven:  a woman clothed with the sun,  and the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown  of twelve stars.
012:002 She was with child.  She cried out in pain, laboring to give birth.
012:003 Another sign was seen in heaven.  Behold, a great red dragon,  having seven heads and ten horns, and on his heads seven crowns.
012:004 His tail drew one third of the stars of the sky, and threw  them to the earth.  The dragon stood before the woman who was  about to give birth, so that when she gave birth he might  devour her child.
012:005 She gave birth to a son, a male child, who is to rule all  the nations with a rod of iron.  Her child was caught up to God,  and to his throne.
012:006 The woman fled into the wilderness, where she has a place  prepared by God, that there they may nourish her one thousand  two hundred sixty days.
012:007 There was war in the sky.  Michael and his angels made war  on the dragon.  The dragon and his angels made war.
012:008 They didn't prevail, neither was a place found for him any  more in heaven.
012:009 The great dragon was thrown down, the old serpent, he who is  called the devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole world.  He was thrown down to the earth, and his angels were thrown  down with him.
012:010 I heard a loud voice in heaven, saying, "Now is come the salvation,  the power, and the Kingdom of our God, and the authority of  his Christ; for the accuser of our brothers has been thrown down,  who accuses them before our God day and night.
012:011 They overcame him because of the Lamb's blood, and because of  the word of their testimony.  They didn't love their life,  even to death.
012:012 Therefore rejoice, heavens, and you who dwell in them.  Woe to the earth and to the sea, because the devil has  gone down to you, having great wrath, knowing that he has  but a short time."
012:013 When the dragon saw that he was thrown down to the earth,  he persecuted the woman who gave birth to the male child.
012:014 Two wings of the great eagle were given to the woman, that she  might fly into the wilderness to her place, so that she  might be nourished for a time, and times, and half a time,  from the face of the serpent.
012:015 The serpent spewed water out of his mouth after the woman  like a river, that he might cause her to be carried away  by the stream.
012:016 The earth helped the woman, and the earth opened its mouth  and swallowed up the river which the dragon spewed out  of his mouth.
012:017 The dragon grew angry with the woman, and went away to make  war with the rest of her seed, who keep God's commandments  and hold Jesus' testimony.
012:018 For you have not come to a mountain that might be touched,  and that burned with fire, and to blackness, darkness, storm,
012:019 the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; which those who  heard it begged that not one more word should be spoken to them,
012:020 for they could not stand that which was commanded, "If even  an animal touches the mountain, it shall be stoned{TR adds "or  shot with an arrow" [see Exodus 19:12-13]};"{Exodus 19:12-13}
013:001 Then I stood on the sand of the sea.  I saw a beast coming  up out of the sea, having ten horns and seven heads.  On his horns were ten crowns, and on his heads, blasphemous names.
013:002 The beast which I saw was like a leopard, and his feet were  like those of a bear, and his mouth like the mouth of a lion.  The dragon gave him his power, his throne, and great authority.
013:003 One of his heads looked like it had been wounded fatally.  His fatal wound was healed, and the whole earth marveled  at the beast.
013:004 They worshiped the dragon, because he gave his authority to the beast,  and they worshiped the beast, saying, "Who is like the beast?  Who is able to make war with him?"
013:005 A mouth speaking great things and blasphemy was given to him.  Authority to make war for forty-two months was given to him.
013:006 He opened his mouth for blasphemy against God, to blaspheme  his name, and his dwelling, those who dwell in heaven.
013:007 It was given to him to make war with the saints, and to  overcome them.  Authority over every tribe, people, language,  and nation was given to him.
013:008 All who dwell on the earth will worship him, everyone whose  name has not been written from the foundation of the world  in the book of life of the Lamb who has been killed.
013:009 If anyone has an ear, let him hear.
013:010 If anyone has captivity, he will go.  If anyone is with the sword,  he must be killed.{TR reads "If anyone leads into captivity,  into captivity he goes.  If anyone will kill with the sword,  he must be killed with a sword."  instead of "If anyone  has captivity, he goes away.  If anyone is with the sword,  he must be killed."} Here is the endurance and the faith  of the saints.
013:011 I saw another beast coming up out of the earth.  He had two horns like a lamb, and he spoke like a dragon.
013:012 He exercises all the authority of the first beast in his presence.  He makes the earth and those who dwell in it to worship  the first beast, whose fatal wound was healed.
013:013 He performs great signs, even making fire come down out of  the sky to the earth in the sight of people.
013:014 He deceives my own people who dwell on the earth because  of the signs he was granted to do in front of the beast;  saying to those who dwell on the earth, that they should make  an image to the beast who had the sword wound and lived.
013:015 It was given to him to give breath to it, to the image  of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak,  and cause as many as wouldn't worship the image of the beast  to be killed.
013:016 He causes all, the small and the great, the rich and the poor,  and the free and the slave, to be given marks on their right hands,  or on their foreheads;
013:017 and that no one would be able to buy or to sell, unless he has  that mark, the name of the beast or the number of his name.
013:018 Here is wisdom.  He who has understanding, let him calculate  the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man.  His number is six hundred sixty-six.
014:001 I saw, and behold, the Lamb standing on Mount Zion, and with him  a number, one hundred forty-four thousand, having his name,  and the name of his Father, written on their foreheads.
014:002 I heard a sound from heaven, like the sound of many waters,  and like the sound of a great thunder.  The sound which I  heard was like that of harpists playing on their harps.
014:003 They sing a new song before the throne, and before the four  living creatures and the elders.  No one could learn the song  except the one hundred forty-four thousand, those who had been  redeemed out of the earth.
014:004 These are those who were not defiled with women, for they  are virgins.  These are those who follow the Lamb wherever he goes.  These were redeemed by Jesus from among men, the first fruits  to God and to the Lamb.
014:005 In their mouth was found no lie, for they are blameless.{TR  adds "before the throne of God"}
014:006 I saw an angel flying in mid heaven, having an eternal  Good News to proclaim to those who dwell on the earth,  and to every nation, tribe, language, and people.
014:007 He said with a loud voice, "Fear the Lord, and give him glory;  for the hour of his judgment has come.  Worship him who made  the heaven, the earth, the sea, and the springs of waters!"
014:008 Another, a second angel, followed, saying, "Babylon the great  has fallen, which has made all the nations to drink of the wine  of the wrath of her sexual immorality."
014:009 Another angel, a third, followed them, saying with a great voice,  "If anyone worships the beast and his image, and receives  a mark on his forehead, or on his hand,
014:010 he also will drink of the wine of the wrath of God,  which is prepared unmixed in the cup of his anger.  He will be tormented with fire and sulfur in the presence  of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb.
014:011 The smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever.  They have no rest day and night, those who worship the beast  and his image, and whoever receives the mark of his name.
014:012 Here is the patience of the saints, those who keep the commandments  of God, and the faith of Jesus."
014:013 I heard the voice from heaven saying, "Write, 'Blessed are the dead  who die in the Lord from now on.'"  "Yes," says the Spirit,  "that they may rest from their labors; for their works  follow with them."
014:014 I looked, and behold, a white cloud; and on the cloud one  sitting like a son of man,{Daniel 7:13} having on his head  a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle.
014:015 Another angel came out from the temple, crying with a loud  voice to him who sat on the cloud, "Send forth your sickle,  and reap; for the hour to reap has come; for the harvest  of the earth is ripe!"
014:016 He who sat on the cloud thrust his sickle on the earth,  and the earth was reaped.
014:017 Another angel came out from the temple which is in heaven.  He also had a sharp sickle.
014:018 Another angel came out from the altar, he who has power  over fire, and he called with a great voice to him who had  the sharp sickle, saying, "Send forth your sharp sickle,  and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth, for the earth's  grapes are fully ripe!"
014:019 The angel thrust his sickle into the earth, and gathered  the vintage of the earth, and threw it into the great winepress  of the wrath of God.
014:020 The winepress was trodden outside of the city, and blood came  out from the winepress, even to the bridles of the horses,  as far as one thousand six hundred stadia.{1600 stadia = 296  kilometers or 184 miles}
014:021 In the law it is written, "By men of strange languages  and by the lips of strangers I will speak to this people.  Not even thus will they hear me, says the Lord."{Isaiah 28:11-12}
014:022 Therefore other languages are for a sign, not to those who believe,  but to the unbelieving; but prophesying is for a sign,  not to the unbelieving, but to those who believe.
014:023 If therefore the whole assembly is assembled together and all  speak with other languages, and unlearned or unbelieving  people come in, won't they say that you are crazy?
014:024 But if all prophesy, and someone unbelieving or unlearned comes in,  he is reproved by all, and he is judged by all.
015:001 I saw another great and marvelous sign in the sky:  seven angels having the seven last plagues, for in them God's  wrath is finished.
015:002 I saw something like a sea of glass mixed with fire, and those  who overcame the beast, his image,{TR adds "his mark,"}  and the number of his name, standing on the sea of glass,  having harps of God.
015:003 They sang the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song  of the Lamb, saying, "Great and marvelous are your works,  Lord God, the Almighty!  Righteous and true are your ways,  you King of the nations.
015:004 Who wouldn't fear you, Lord, and glorify your name?  For you only  are holy.  For all the nations will come and worship before you.  For your righteous acts have been revealed."
015:005 After these things I looked, and the temple of the tabernacle  of the testimony in heaven was opened.
015:006 The seven angels who had the seven plagues came out,  clothed with pure, bright linen, and wearing golden sashes  around their breasts.
015:007 One of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels  seven golden bowls full of the wrath of God, who lives  forever and ever.
015:008 The temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God,  and from his power.  No one was able to enter into the temple,  until the seven plagues of the seven angels would be finished.
015:009 For I am the least of the apostles, who is not worthy to be  called an apostle, because I persecuted the assembly of God.
015:010 But by the grace of God I am what I am.  His grace which was  bestowed on me was not futile, but I worked more than all of them;  yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.
015:011 Whether then it is I or they, so we preach, and so you believed.
015:012 Now if Christ is preached, that he has been raised from the dead,  how do some among you say that there is no resurrection  of the dead?
015:013 But if there is no resurrection of the dead, neither has  Christ been raised.
015:014 If Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is in vain,  and your faith also is in vain.
015:015 Yes, we are found false witnesses of God, because we testified  about God that he raised up Christ, whom he didn't raise up,  if it is so that the dead are not raised.
015:016 For if the dead aren't raised, neither has Christ been raised.
015:017 If Christ has not been raised, your faith is vain; you are still  in your sins.
015:018 Then they also who are fallen asleep in Christ have perished.
015:019 If we have only hoped in Christ in this life, we are of all  men most pitiable.
015:020 But now Christ has been raised from the dead.  He became  the first fruits of those who are asleep.
015:021 For since death came by man, the resurrection of the dead  also came by man.
016:001 I heard a loud voice out of the temple, saying to the seven angels,  "Go and pour out the seven bowls of the wrath of God  on the earth!"
016:002 The first went, and poured out his bowl into the earth,  and it became a harmful and evil sore on the people who had  the mark of the beast, and who worshiped his image.
016:003 The second angel poured out his bowl into the sea, and it became  blood as of a dead man.  Every living thing in the sea died.
016:004 The third poured out his bowl into the rivers and springs of water,  and they became blood.
016:005 I heard the angel of the waters saying, "You are righteous,  who are and who were, you Holy One, because you have  judged these things.
016:006 For they poured out the blood of the saints and the prophets,  and you have given them blood to drink.  They deserve this."
016:007 I heard the altar saying, "Yes, Lord God, the Almighty,  true and righteous are your judgments."
016:008 The fourth poured out his bowl on the sun, and it was given  to him to scorch men with fire.
016:009 People were scorched with great heat, and people blasphemed  the name of God who has the power over these plagues.  They didn't repent and give him glory.
016:010 The fifth poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast,  and his kingdom was darkened.  They gnawed their tongues  because of the pain,
016:011 and they blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains  and their sores.  They didn't repent of their works.
016:012 The sixth poured out his bowl on the great river, the Euphrates.  Its water was dried up, that the way might be made ready  for the kings that come from the sunrise.
016:013 I saw coming out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth  of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet,  three unclean spirits, something like frogs;
016:014 for they are spirits of demons, performing signs; which go forth  to the kings of the whole inhabited earth, to gather them  together for the war of that great day of God, the Almighty.
016:015 "Behold, I come like a thief.  Blessed is he who watches,  and keeps his clothes, so that he doesn't walk naked,  and they see his shame."
016:016 He gathered them together into the place which is called  in Hebrew, Megiddo.
017:001 One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and spoke  with me, saying, "Come here.  I will show you the judgment  of the great prostitute who sits on many waters,
017:002 with whom the kings of the earth committed sexual immorality,  and those who dwell in the earth were made drunken with the wine  of her sexual immorality."
017:003 He carried me away in the Spirit into a wilderness.  I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet-colored animal, full of  blasphemous names, having seven heads and ten horns.
017:004 The woman was dressed in purple and scarlet, and decked with gold  and precious stones and pearls, having in her hand a golden  cup full of abominations and the impurities of the sexual  immorality of the earth.
017:005 And on her forehead a name was written, "MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT,  THE MOTHER OF THE PROSTITUTES AND OF THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH."
017:006 I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints,  and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus.  When I saw her,  I wondered with great amazement.
017:007 The angel said to me, "Why do you wonder?  I will tell you  the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carries her,  which has the seven heads and the ten horns.
017:008 The beast that you saw was, and is not; and is about  to come up out of the abyss and to go into destruction.  Those who dwell on the earth and whose names have not  been written in the book of life from the foundation  of the world will marvel when they see that the beast was,  and is not, and shall be present.{TR reads "yet is"  instead of "shall be present"}
017:009 Here is the mind that has wisdom.  The seven heads are  seven mountains, on which the woman sits.
017:010 They are seven kings.  Five have fallen, the one is,  the other has not yet come.  When he comes, he must continue  a little while.
017:011 The beast that was, and is not, is himself also an eighth,  and is of the seven; and he goes to destruction.
017:012 The ten horns that you saw are ten kings who have received  no kingdom as yet, but they receive authority as kings,  with the beast, for one hour.
017:013 These have one mind, and they give their power and authority  to the beast.
017:014 These will war against the Lamb, and the Lamb will overcome them,  for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings.  They also will  overcome who are with him, called and chosen and faithful."
017:015 He said to me, "The waters which you saw, where the prostitute sits,  are peoples, multitudes, nations, and languages.
017:016 The ten horns which you saw, and the beast, these will hate  the prostitute, and will make her desolate, and will make her naked,  and will eat her flesh, and will burn her utterly with fire.
017:017 For God has put in their hearts to do what he has in mind,  and to be of one mind, and to give their kingdom to the beast,  until the words of God should be accomplished.
017:018 The woman whom you saw is the great city, which reigns over  the kings of the earth."
017:019 They took hold of him, and brought him to the Areopagus,  saying, "May we know what this new teaching is, which is  spoken by you?
017:020 For you bring certain strange things to our ears.  We want to know therefore what these things mean."
017:021 Now all the Athenians and the strangers living there spent  their time in nothing else, but either to tell or to hear  some new thing.
017:022 Paul stood in the middle of the Areopagus, and said,  "You men of Athens, I perceive that you are very religious  in all things.
017:023 For as I passed along, and observed the objects of your worship,  I found also an altar with this inscription:  'TO AN UNKNOWN GOD.'  What therefore you worship in ignorance, this I announce to you.
017:024 The God who made the world and all things in it, he, being Lord  of heaven and earth, doesn't dwell in temples made with hands,
017:025 neither is he served by men's hands, as though he needed anything,  seeing he himself gives to all life and breath, and all things.
017:026 He made from one blood every nation of men to dwell on all  the surface of the earth, having determined appointed seasons,  and the boundaries of their dwellings,
017:027 that they should seek the Lord, if perhaps they might reach  out for him and find him, though he is not far from each  one of us.
018:001 After these things, I saw another angel coming down out of  the sky, having great authority.  The earth was illuminated  with his glory.
018:002 He cried with a mighty voice, saying, "Fallen, fallen is  Babylon the great, and she has become a habitation of demons,  a prison of every unclean spirit, and a prison of every  unclean and hateful bird!
018:003 For all the nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her  sexual immorality, the kings of the earth committed sexual  immorality with her, and the merchants of the earth grew rich  from the abundance of her luxury."
018:004 I heard another voice from heaven, saying, "Come out of her,  my people, that you have no participation in her sins,  and that you don't receive of her plagues,
018:005 for her sins have reached to the sky, and God has  remembered her iniquities.
018:006 Return to her just as she returned, and repay her double as she did,  and according to her works.  In the cup which she mixed,  mix to her double.
018:007 However much she glorified herself, and grew wanton, so much  give her of torment and mourning.  For she says in her heart,  'I sit a queen, and am no widow, and will in no way see mourning.'
018:008 Therefore in one day her plagues will come:  death, mourning,  and famine; and she will be utterly burned with fire;  for the Lord God who has judged her is strong.
018:009 The kings of the earth, who committed sexual immorality  and lived wantonly with her, will weep and wail over her,  when they look at the smoke of her burning,
018:010 standing far away for the fear of her torment, saying,  'Woe, woe, the great city, Babylon, the strong city!  For your judgment has come in one hour.'
018:011 The merchants of the earth weep and mourn over her, for no  one buys their merchandise any more;
018:012 merchandise of gold, silver, precious stones, pearls, fine linen,  purple, silk, scarlet, all expensive wood, every vessel of ivory,  every vessel made of most precious wood, and of brass,  and iron, and marble;
018:013 and cinnamon, incense, perfume, frankincense, wine, olive oil,  fine flour, wheat, sheep, horses, chariots, and people's  bodies and souls.
018:014 The fruits which your soul lusted after have been lost to you,  and all things that were dainty and sumptuous have perished  from you, and you will find them no more at all.
018:015 The merchants of these things, who were made rich by her,  will stand far away for the fear of her torment,  weeping and mourning;
018:016 saying, 'Woe, woe, the great city, she who was dressed  in fine linen, purple, and scarlet, and decked with gold  and precious stones and pearls!
018:017 For in an hour such great riches are made desolate.'  Every shipmaster, and everyone who sails anywhere, and mariners,  and as many as gain their living by sea, stood far away,
018:018 and cried out as they looked at the smoke of her burning,  saying, 'What is like the great city?'
018:019 They cast dust on their heads, and cried, weeping and mourning,  saying, 'Woe, woe, the great city, in which all who had their  ships in the sea were made rich by reason of her great wealth!'  For in one hour is she made desolate.
018:020 "Rejoice over her, O heaven, you saints, apostles, and prophets;  for God has judged your judgment on her."
018:021 A mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone and cast  it into the sea, saying, "Thus with violence will Babylon,  the great city, be thrown down, and will be found no more at all.
018:022 The voice of harpists, minstrels, flute players, and trumpeters  will be heard no more at all in you.  No craftsman,  of whatever craft, will be found any more at all in you.  The sound of a mill will be heard no more at all in you.
018:023 The light of a lamp will shine no more at all in you.  The voice of the bridegroom and of the bride will be heard no more  at all in you; for your merchants were the princes of the earth;  for with your sorcery all the nations were deceived.
018:024 In her was found the blood of prophets and of saints,  and of all who have been slain on the earth."
018:025 This man had been instructed in the way of the Lord; and being  fervent in spirit, he spoke and taught accurately the things  concerning Jesus, although he knew only the baptism of John.
018:026 He began to speak boldly in the synagogue.  But when Priscilla  and Aquila heard him, they took him aside, and explained  to him the way of God more accurately.
018:027 When he had determined to pass over into Achaia, the brothers  encouraged him, and wrote to the disciples to receive him.  When he had come, he greatly helped those who had  believed through grace;
018:028 for he powerfully refuted the Jews, publicly showing by  the Scriptures that Jesus was the Christ.
018:029 Pilate therefore went out to them, and said, "What accusation  do you bring against this man?"
018:030 They answered him, "If this man weren't an evildoer, we wouldn't  have delivered him up to you."
018:031 Pilate therefore said to them, "Take him yourselves, and judge  him according to your law."  Therefore the Jews said to him,  "It is not lawful for us to put anyone to death,"
018:032 that the word of Jesus might be fulfilled, which he spoke,  signifying by what kind of death he should die.
018:033 Pilate therefore entered again into the Praetorium, called Jesus,  and said to him, "Are you the King of the Jews?"
019:001 After these things I heard something like a loud voice of a great  multitude in heaven, saying, "Hallelujah!  Salvation, power,  and glory belong to our God:
019:002 for true and righteous are his judgments.  For he has judged  the great prostitute, who corrupted the earth with her  sexual immorality, and he has avenged the blood of his servants  at her hand."
019:003 A second said, "Hallelujah!  Her smoke goes up forever and ever."
019:004 The twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and  worshiped God who sits on the throne, saying, "Amen!  Hallelujah!"
019:005 A voice came forth from the throne, saying, "Give praise  to our God, all you his servants, you who fear him, the small  and the great!"
019:006 I heard something like the voice of a great multitude,  and like the voice of many waters, and like the voice of  mighty thunders, saying, "Hallelujah!  For the Lord our God,  the Almighty, reigns!
019:007 Let us rejoice and be exceedingly glad, and let us give  the glory to him.  For the marriage of the Lamb has come,  and his wife has made herself ready."
019:008 It was given to her that she would array herself in bright,  pure, fine linen:  for the fine linen is the righteous acts  of the saints.
019:009 He said to me, "Write, 'Blessed are those who are invited  to the marriage supper of the Lamb.'"  He said to me,  "These are true words of God."
019:010 I fell down before his feet to worship him.  He said  to me, "Look!  Don't do it!  I am a fellow bondservant with you  and with your brothers who hold the testimony of Jesus.  Worship God, for the testimony of Jesus is the Spirit of Prophecy."
019:011 I saw the heaven opened, and behold, a white horse,  and he who sat on it is called Faithful and True.  In righteousness he judges and makes war.
019:012 His eyes are a flame of fire, and on his head are many crowns.  He has names written and a name written which no one knows  but he himself.
019:013 He is clothed in a garment sprinkled with blood.  His name is called "The Word of God."
019:014 The armies which are in heaven followed him on white horses,  clothed in white, pure, fine linen.
019:015 Out of his mouth proceeds a sharp, double-edged sword,  that with it he should strike the nations.  He will rule  them with an iron rod.{Psalm 2:9} He treads the winepress  of the fierceness of the wrath of God, the Almighty.
019:016 He has on his garment and on his thigh a name written,  "KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS."
019:017 I saw an angel standing in the sun.  He cried with a loud voice,  saying to all the birds that fly in the sky, "Come!  Be gathered  together to the great supper of God,{TR reads "supper  of the great God" instead of "great supper of God"}
019:018 that you may eat the flesh of kings, the flesh of captains,  the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses and of those  who sit on them, and the flesh of all men, both free and slave,  and small and great."
019:019 I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies,  gathered together to make war against him who sat on the horse,  and against his army.
019:020 The beast was taken, and with him the false prophet who worked  the signs in his sight, with which he deceived those who had  received the mark of the beast and those who worshiped his image.  These two were thrown alive into the lake of fire that  burns with sulfur.
019:021 The rest were killed with the sword of him who sat on  the horse, the sword which came forth out of his mouth.  All the birds were filled with their flesh.
019:022 Having sent into Macedonia two of those who served him,  Timothy and Erastus, he himself stayed in Asia for a while.
019:023 About that time there arose no small stir concerning the Way.
019:024 For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, who made  silver shrines of Artemis, brought no little business  to the craftsmen,
019:025 whom he gathered together, with the workmen of like occupation,  and said, "Sirs, you know that by this business we have our wealth.
019:026 You see and hear, that not at Ephesus alone, but almost throughout  all Asia, this Paul has persuaded and turned away many people,  saying that they are no gods, that are made with hands.
019:027 Not only is there danger that this our trade come into disrepute,  but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis  will be counted as nothing, and her majesty destroyed,  whom all Asia and the world worships."
019:028 When they heard this they were filled with anger, and cried out,  saying, "Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!"
019:029 The whole city was filled with confusion, and they rushed with one  accord into the theater, having seized Gaius and Aristarchus,  men of Macedonia, Paul's companions in travel.
019:030 When Paul wanted to enter in to the people, the disciples  didn't allow him.
019:031 Certain also of the Asiarchs, being his friends, sent to him  and begged him not to venture into the theater.
019:032 Some therefore cried one thing, and some another, for the  assembly was in confusion.  Most of them didn't know why they  had come together.
019:033 They brought Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting  him forward.  Alexander beckoned with his hand, and would  have made a defense to the people.
019:034 But when they perceived that he was a Jew, all with one voice  for a time of about two hours cried out, "Great is Artemis  of the Ephesians!"
019:035 When the town clerk had quieted the multitude, he said, "You men  of Ephesus, what man is there who doesn't know that the city  of the Ephesians is temple keeper of the great goddess Artemis,  and of the image which fell down from Zeus?
019:036 Seeing then that these things can't be denied, you ought  to be quiet, and to do nothing rash.
019:037 For you have brought these men here, who are neither robbers  of temples nor blasphemers of your goddess.
019:038 If therefore Demetrius and the craftsmen who are with him  have a matter against anyone, the courts are open, and there  are proconsuls.  Let them press charges against one another.
020:001 I saw an angel coming down out of heaven, having the key  of the abyss and a great chain in his hand.
020:002 He seized the dragon, the old serpent, which is the devil  and Satan, who deceives the whole inhabited earth, and bound  him for a thousand years,
020:003 and cast him into the abyss, and shut it, and sealed it  over him, that he should deceive the nations no more,  until the thousand years were finished.  After this, he must  be freed for a short time.
020:004 I saw thrones, and they sat on them, and judgment was given  to them.  I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded  for the testimony of Jesus, and for the word of God,  and such as didn't worship the beast nor his image, and didn't  receive the mark on their forehead and on their hand.  They lived, and reigned with Christ for the thousand years.
020:005 The rest of the dead didn't live until the thousand years  were finished.  This is the first resurrection.
020:006 Blessed and holy is he who has part in the first resurrection.  Over these, the second death has no power, but they will  be priests of God and of Christ, and will reign with him  one thousand years.
020:007 And after the thousand years, Satan will be released  from his prison,
020:008 and he will come out to deceive the nations which are in the four  corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together  to the war; the number of whom is as the sand of the sea.
020:009 They went up over the breadth of the earth, and surrounded  the camp of the saints, and the beloved city.  Fire came  down out of heaven from God, and devoured them.
020:010 The devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire  and sulfur, where the beast and the false prophet are also.  They will be tormented day and night forever and ever.
020:011 I saw a great white throne, and him who sat on it,  from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away.  There was found no place for them.
020:012 I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before  the throne, and they opened books.  Another book was opened,  which is the book of life.  The dead were judged out of the things  which were written in the books, according to their works.
020:013 The sea gave up the dead who were in it.  Death and Hades{or, Hell} gave up the dead who were in them.  They were judged, each one according to his works.
020:014 Death and Hades{or, Hell} were thrown into the lake of fire.  This is the second death, the lake of fire.
020:015 If anyone was not found written in the book of life, he was  cast into the lake of fire.
020:016 For Paul had determined to sail past Ephesus, that he might not  have to spend time in Asia; for he was hastening, if it were  possible for him, to be in Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost.
020:017 From Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called to himself the elders  of the assembly.
020:018 When they had come to him, he said to them, "You yourselves know,  from the first day that I set foot in Asia, how I was with you  all the time,
021:001 I saw a new heaven and a new earth:  for the first heaven  and the first earth have passed away, and the sea is no more.
021:002 I saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven  from God, made ready like a bride adorned for her husband.
021:003 I heard a loud voice out of heaven saying, "Behold, God's dwelling  is with people, and he will dwell with them, and they will be  his people, and God himself will be with them as their God.
021:004 He will wipe away from them every tear from their eyes.  Death will be no more; neither will there be mourning, nor crying,  nor pain, any more.  The first things have passed away."
021:005 He who sits on the throne said, "Behold, I am making all things new."  He said, "Write, for these words of God are faithful and true."
021:006 He said to me, "It is done!  I am the Alpha and the Omega,  the Beginning and the End.  I will give freely to him who is  thirsty from the spring of the water of life.
021:007 He who overcomes, I will give him these things.  I will be his God, and he will be my son.
021:008 But for the cowardly, unbelieving, sinners, abominable, murderers,  sexually immoral, sorcerers,{The word for "sorcerers"  here also includes users of potions and drugs.} idolaters,  and all liars, their part is in the lake that burns with fire  and sulfur, which is the second death."
021:009 One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls, who were  loaded with the seven last plagues came, and he spoke  with me, saying, "Come here.  I will show you the wife,  the Lamb's bride."
021:010 He carried me away in the Spirit to a great and high mountain,  and showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out  of heaven from God,
021:011 having the glory of God.  Her light was like a most precious stone,  as if it was a jasper stone, clear as crystal;
021:012 having a great and high wall; having twelve gates, and at  the gates twelve angels; and names written on them, which are  the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel.
021:013 On the east were three gates; and on the north three gates;  and on the south three gates; and on the west three gates.
021:014 The wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them twelve  names of the twelve Apostles of the Lamb.
021:015 He who spoke with me had for a measure, a golden reed,  to measure the city, its gates, and its walls.
021:016 The city lies foursquare, and its length is as great as its breadth.  He measured the city with the reed, Twelve thousand twelve  stadia{12,012 stadia = or 2,221 kilometers or 1,380 miles.  TR reads 12,000 stadia instead of 12,012 stadia.}. Its length,  breadth, and height are equal.
021:017 Its wall is one hundred forty-four cubits,{144 cubits is about  65.8 meters or 216 feet} by the measure of a man, that is,  of an angel.
021:018 The construction of its wall was jasper.  The city was pure gold,  like pure glass.
021:019 The foundations of the city's wall were adorned with all  kinds of precious stones.  The first foundation was jasper;  the second, sapphire{or, lapis lazuli}; the third, chalcedony;  the fourth, emerald;
021:020 the fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite;  the eighth, beryl; the ninth, topaz; the tenth, chrysoprasus;  the eleventh, jacinth; and the twelfth, amethyst.
021:021 The twelve gates were twelve pearls.  Each one of the gates  was made of one pearl.  The street of the city was pure gold,  like transparent glass.
021:022 I saw no temple in it, for the Lord God, the Almighty,  and the Lamb, are its temple.
021:023 The city has no need for the sun, neither of the moon, to shine,  for the very glory of God illuminated it, and its lamp  is the Lamb.
021:024 The nations will walk in its light.  The kings of the earth  bring the glory and honor of the nations into it.
021:025 Its gates will in no way be shut by day (for there will be  no night there),
021:026 and they shall bring the glory and the honor of the nations  into it so that they may enter.
021:027 There will in no way enter into it anything profane, or one  who causes an abomination or a lie, but only those who are  written in the Lamb's book of life.
021:028 crying out, "Men of Israel, help!  This is the man who teaches all  men everywhere against the people, and the law, and this place.  Moreover, he also brought Greeks into the temple, and has  defiled this holy place!"
021:029 For they had seen Trophimus, the Ephesian, with him in the city,  and they supposed that Paul had brought him into the temple.
021:030 All the city was moved, and the people ran together.  They seized Paul and dragged him out of the temple.  Immediately the doors were shut.
021:031 As they were trying to kill him, news came up to the commanding  officer of the regiment that all Jerusalem was in an uproar.
021:032 Immediately he took soldiers and centurions, and ran down to them.  They, when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers,  stopped beating Paul.
021:033 Then the commanding officer came near, arrested him,  commanded him to be bound with two chains, and inquired  who he was and what he had done.
021:034 Some shouted one thing, and some another, among the crowd.  When he couldn't find out the truth because of the noise,  he commanded him to be brought into the barracks.
022:001 He showed me a{TR adds "pure"} river of water of life,  clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and  of the Lamb,
022:002 in the middle of its street.  On this side of the river and on  that was the tree of life, bearing twelve kinds of fruits,  yielding its fruit every month.  The leaves of the tree  were for the healing of the nations.
022:003 There will be no curse any more.  The throne of God and of  the Lamb will be in it, and his servants serve him.
022:004 They will see his face, and his name will be on their foreheads.
022:005 There will be no night, and they need no lamp light;  for the Lord God will illuminate them.  They will reign  forever and ever.
022:006 He said to me, "These words are faithful and true.  The Lord God of the spirits of the prophets sent his angel  to show to his bondservants the things which must happen soon."
022:007 "Behold, I come quickly.  Blessed is he who keeps the words  of the prophecy of this book."
022:008 Now I, John, am the one who heard and saw these things.  When I heard and saw, I fell down to worship before the feet  of the angel who had shown me these things.
022:009 He said to me, "See you don't do it!  I am a fellow bondservant  with you and with your brothers, the prophets, and with those  who keep the words of this book.  Worship God."
022:010 He said to me, "Don't seal up the words of the prophecy  of this book, for the time is at hand.
022:011 He who acts unjustly, let him act unjustly still.  He who is filthy, let him be filthy still.  He who is righteous,  let him do righteousness still.  He who is holy, let him  be holy still."
022:012 "Behold, I come quickly.  My reward is with me, to repay  to each man according to his work.
022:013 I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last,  the Beginning and the End.
022:014 Blessed are those who do his commandments, that they may have  the right to the tree of life, and may enter in by the gates  into the city.
022:015 Outside are the dogs, the sorcerers, the sexually immoral,  the murderers, the idolaters, and everyone who loves  and practices falsehood.
022:016 I, Jesus, have sent my angel to testify these things to you  for the assemblies.  I am the root and the offspring of David;  the Bright and Morning Star."
022:017 The Spirit and the bride say, "Come!"  He who hears,  let him say, "Come!"  He who is thirsty, let him come.  He who desires, let him take the water of life freely.
022:018 I testify to everyone who hears the words of the prophecy  of this book, if anyone adds to them, may God add to him  the plagues which are written in this book.
022:019 If anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy,  may God take away his part from the tree of life, and out  of the holy city, which are written in this book.
022:020 He who testifies these things says, "Yes, I come quickly."  Amen!  Yes, come, Lord Jesus.
022:021 "He said to me, 'Depart, for I will send you out far from here  to the Gentiles.'"
022:022 They listened to him until he said that; then they lifted  up their voice, and said, "Rid the earth of this fellow,  for he isn't fit to live!"
022:023 As they cried out, and threw off their cloaks, and threw dust  into the air,
022:024 the commanding officer commanded him to be brought into the barracks,  ordering him to be examined by scourging, that he might know  for what crime they shouted against him like that.
023:001 Paul, looking steadfastly at the council, said, "Brothers, I have  lived before God in all good conscience until this day."
023:002 The high priest, Ananias, commanded those who stood by him  to strike him on the mouth.
023:003 Then Paul said to him, "God will strike you, you whitewashed wall!  Do you sit to judge me according to the law, and command me  to be struck contrary to the law?"
023:004 Those who stood by said, "Do you malign God's high priest?"
023:005 Paul said, "I didn't know, brothers, that he was high priest.  For it is written, 'You shall not speak evil of a ruler  of your people.'"{Exodus 22:28}
023:006 But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees  and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council,  "Men and brothers, I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees.  Concerning the hope and resurrection of the dead I  am being judged!"
023:007 When he had said this, an argument arose between the Pharisees  and Sadducees, and the assembly was divided.
023:008 For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, nor angel,  nor spirit; but the Pharisees confess all of these.
023:009 A great clamor arose, and some of the scribes of the Pharisees part  stood up, and contended, saying, "We find no evil in this man.  But if a spirit or angel has spoken to him, let's not  fight against God!"
023:010 When a great argument arose, the commanding officer, fearing that  Paul would be torn in pieces by them, commanded the soldiers  to go down and take him by force from among them, and bring  him into the barracks.
023:011 The following night, the Lord stood by him, and said,  "Cheer up, Paul, for as you have testified about me at Jerusalem,  so you must testify also at Rome."
023:012 When it was day, some of the Jews banded together, and bound  themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat  nor drink until they had killed Paul.
023:013 There were more than forty people who had made this conspiracy.
023:014 They came to the chief priests and the elders, and said,  "We have bound ourselves under a great curse, to taste nothing  until we have killed Paul.
023:015 Now therefore, you with the council inform the commanding  officer that he should bring him down to you tomorrow,  as though you were going to judge his case more exactly.  We are ready to kill him before he comes near."
023:016 But Paul's sister's son heard of their lying in wait,  and he came and entered into the barracks and told Paul.
023:017 Paul summoned one of the centurions, and said, "Bring this  young man to the commanding officer, for he has something  to tell him."
023:018 So he took him, and brought him to the commanding officer,  and said, "Paul, the prisoner, summoned me and asked me to bring  this young man to you, who has something to tell you."
023:019 The commanding officer took him by the hand, and going aside,  asked him privately, "What is it that you have to tell me?"
023:020 He said, "The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul  down to the council tomorrow, as though intending to inquire  somewhat more accurately concerning him.
024:001 After five days, the high priest, Ananias, came down  with certain elders and an orator, one Tertullus.  They informed the governor against Paul.
024:002 When he was called, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying,  "Seeing that by you we enjoy much peace, and that excellent  measures are coming to this nation,
024:003 we accept it in all ways and in all places, most excellent Felix,  with all thankfulness.
024:004 But, that I don't delay you, I entreat you to bear with us  and hear a few words.
024:005 For we have found this man to be a plague, an instigator  of insurrections among all the Jews throughout the world,  and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes.
024:006 He even tried to profane the temple, and we arrested him.{TR  adds "We wanted to judge him according to our law,"}
024:007 {TR adds "but the commanding officer, Lysias, came by and with  great violence took him out of our hands,"}
024:008 {TR adds "commanding his accusers to come to you."}By examining  him yourself you may ascertain all these things of which  we accuse him."
024:009 The Jews also joined in the attack, affirming that these  things were so.
024:010 When the governor had beckoned to him to speak, Paul answered,  "Because I know that you have been a judge of this nation  for many years, I cheerfully make my defense,
024:011 seeing that you can recognize that it is not more than twelve  days since I went up to worship at Jerusalem.
024:012 In the temple they didn't find me disputing with anyone or stirring  up a crowd, either in the synagogues, or in the city.
024:013 Nor can they prove to you the things of which they now accuse me.
024:014 But this I confess to you, that after the Way, which they call  a sect, so I serve the God of our fathers, believing all  things which are according to the law, and which are written  in the prophets;
024:015 having hope toward God, which these also themselves look for,  that there will be a resurrection of the dead, both of  the just and unjust.
024:016 Herein I also practice always having a conscience void of offense  toward God and men.
024:017 Now after some years, I came to bring gifts for the needy  to my nation, and offerings;
024:018 amid which certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple,  not with a mob, nor with turmoil.
024:019 They ought to have been here before you, and to make accusation,  if they had anything against me.
024:020 Or else let these men themselves say what injustice they found  in me when I stood before the council,
024:021 unless it is for this one thing that I cried standing among them,  'Concerning the resurrection of the dead I am being judged  before you today!'"
024:022 But Felix, having more exact knowledge concerning the Way,  deferred them, saying, "When Lysias, the commanding officer,  comes down, I will decide your case."
024:023 He ordered the centurion that Paul should be kept in custody,  and should have some privileges, and not to forbid any of his  friends to serve him or to visit him.
024:024 But after some days, Felix came with Drusilla, his wife,  who was a Jewess, and sent for Paul, and heard him concerning  the faith in Christ Jesus.
024:025 As he reasoned about righteousness, self-control, and the  judgment to come, Felix was terrified, and answered,  "Go your way for this time, and when it is convenient for me,  I will summon you."
024:026 Meanwhile, he also hoped that money would be given to him by Paul,  that he might release him.  Therefore also he sent for him  more often, and talked with him.
024:027 But when two years were fulfilled, Felix was succeeded by  Porcius Festus, and desiring to gain favor with the Jews, Felix left  Paul in bonds.
024:028 They drew near to the village, where they were going,  and he acted like he would go further.
024:029 They urged him, saying, "Stay with us, for it is almost evening,  and the day is almost over."  He went in to stay with them.
024:030 It happened, that when he had sat down at the table with them,  he took the bread and gave thanks.  Breaking it, he gave to them.
024:031 Their eyes were opened, and they recognized him, and he vanished  out of their sight.
024:032 They said one to another, "Weren't our hearts burning within us,  while he spoke to us along the way, and while he opened  the Scriptures to us?"
024:033 They rose up that very hour, returned to Jerusalem, and found  the eleven gathered together, and those who were with them,
024:034 saying, "The Lord is risen indeed, and has appeared to Simon!"
024:035 They related the things that happened along the way, and how  he was recognized by them in the breaking of the bread.
024:036 As they said these things, Jesus himself stood among them,  and said to them, "Peace be to you."
024:037 But they were terrified and filled with fear, and supposed  that they had seen a spirit.
024:038 He said to them, "Why are you troubled?  Why do doubts arise  in your hearts?
024:039 See my hands and my feet, that it is truly me.  Touch me and see, for a spirit doesn't have flesh and bones,  as you see that I have."
024:040 When he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet.
024:041 While they still didn't believe for joy, and wondered,  he said to them, "Do you have anything here to eat?"
024:042 They gave him a piece of a broiled fish and some honeycomb.
024:043 He took them, and ate in front of them.
024:044 He said to them, "This is what I told you, while I was still  with you, that all things which are written in the law of Moses,  the prophets, and the psalms, concerning me must be fulfilled."
024:045 Then he opened their minds, that they might understand  the Scriptures.
024:046 He said to them, "Thus it is written, and thus it was necessary  for the Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day,
024:047 and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached  in his name to all the nations, beginning at Jerusalem.
024:048 You are witnesses of these things.
024:049 Behold, I send forth the promise of my Father on you.  But wait in the city of Jerusalem until you are clothed  with power from on high."
024:050 He led them out as far as Bethany, and he lifted up his hands,  and blessed them.
024:051 It happened, while he blessed them, that he withdrew from them,  and was carried up into heaven.
024:052 They worshiped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy,
024:053 and were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God.  Amen.Book 43 John
024:054 They ate and drank, he and the men who were with him,  and stayed all night.  They rose up in the morning, and he said,  "Send me away to my master."
024:055 Her brother and her mother said, "Let the young lady stay  with us a few days, at least ten.  After that she will go."
024:056 He said to them, "Don't hinder me, seeing Yahweh has prospered  my way.  Send me away that I may go to my master."
024:057 They said, "We will call the young lady, and ask her."
024:058 They called Rebekah, and said to her, "Will you go with this man?"  She said, "I will go."
024:059 They sent away Rebekah, their sister, with her nurse,  Abraham's servant, and his men.
024:060 They blessed Rebekah, and said to her, "Our sister, may you  be the mother of thousands of ten thousands, and let your seed  possess the gate of those who hate them."
024:061 Rebekah arose with her ladies.  They rode on the camels,  and followed the man.  The servant took Rebekah, and went his way.
024:062 Isaac came from the way of Beer Lahai Roi, for he lived  in the land of the South.
024:063 Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the evening.  He lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, there  were camels coming.
024:064 Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac,  she dismounted from the camel.
024:065 She said to the servant, "Who is the man who is walking in  the field to meet us?"  The servant said, "It is my master."  She took her veil, and covered herself.
024:066 The servant told Isaac all the things that he had done.
024:067 Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent,  and took Rebekah, and she became his wife.  He loved her.  Isaac was comforted after his mother's death.
025:001 Festus therefore, having come into the province, after three days  went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea.
025:002 Then the high priest and the principal men of the Jews informed  him against Paul, and they begged him,
025:003 asking a favor against him, that he would summon him to Jerusalem;  plotting to kill him on the way.
025:004 However Festus answered that Paul should be kept in custody  at Caesarea, and that he himself was about to depart shortly.
025:005 "Let them therefore," said he, "that are in power among you  go down with me, and if there is anything wrong in the man,  let them accuse him."
025:006 When he had stayed among them more than ten days, he went down  to Caesarea, and on the next day he sat on the judgment seat,  and commanded Paul to be brought.
025:007 When he had come, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem  stood around him, bringing against him many and grievous  charges which they could not prove,
025:008 while he said in his defense, "Neither against the law  of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Caesar,  have I sinned at all."
025:009 But Festus, desiring to gain favor with the Jews, answered Paul  and said, "Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem, and be judged  by me there concerning these things?"
025:010 But Paul said, "I am standing before Caesar's judgment seat,  where I ought to be tried.  I have done no wrong to the Jews,  as you also know very well.
025:011 For if I have done wrong, and have committed anything worthy  of death, I don't refuse to die; but if none of those things  is true that they accuse me of, no one can give me up to them.  I appeal to Caesar!"
025:012 Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered,  "You have appealed to Caesar.  To Caesar you shall go."
025:013 Now when some days had passed, Agrippa the King and Bernice  arrived at Caesarea, and greeted Festus.
025:014 As he stayed there many days, Festus laid Paul's case before  the king, saying, "There is a certain man left a prisoner by Felix;
025:015 about whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders  of the Jews informed me, asking for a sentence against him.
025:016 To whom I answered that it is not the custom of the Romans  to give up any man to destruction, before the accused has met  the accusers face to face, and has had opportunity to make  his defense concerning the matter laid against him.
025:017 When therefore they had come together here, I didn't delay,  but on the next day sat on the judgment seat, and commanded  the man to be brought.
025:018 Concerning whom, when the accusers stood up, they brought  no charge of such things as I supposed;
025:019 but had certain questions against him about their own religion,  and about one Jesus, who was dead, whom Paul affirmed  to be alive.
025:020 Being perplexed how to inquire concerning these things,  I asked whether he was willing to go to Jerusalem and there  be judged concerning these matters.
025:021 But when Paul had appealed to be kept for the decision of  the emperor, I commanded him to be kept until I could send  him to Caesar."
025:022 Agrippa said to Festus, "I also would like to hear the man myself."  "Tomorrow," he said, "you shall hear him."
025:023 So on the next day, when Agrippa and Bernice had come with  great pomp, and they had entered into the place of hearing  with the commanding officers and principal men of the city,  at the command of Festus, Paul was brought in.
025:024 Festus said, "King Agrippa, and all men who are here present  with us, you see this man, about whom all the multitude  of the Jews petitioned me, both at Jerusalem and here,  crying that he ought not to live any longer.
025:025 But when I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death,  and as he himself appealed to the emperor I determined  to send him.
025:026 Of whom I have no certain thing to write to my lord.  Therefore I have brought him forth before you, and especially  before you, King Agrippa, that, after examination, I may have  something to write.
025:027 For it seems to me unreasonable, in sending a prisoner,  not to also specify the charges against him."
025:028 Take away therefore the talent from him, and give it to him  who has the ten talents.
025:029 For to everyone who has will be given, and he will have abundance,  but from him who doesn't have, even that which he has will  be taken away.
025:030 Throw out the unprofitable servant into the outer darkness,  where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.'
025:031 "But when the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the holy  angels with him, then he will sit on the throne of his glory.
025:032 Before him all the nations will be gathered, and he will separate  them one from another, as a shepherd separates the sheep  from the goats.
025:033 He will set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats  on the left.
025:034 Then the King will tell those on his right hand, 'Come,  blessed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you  from the foundation of the world;
026:001 Agrippa said to Paul, "You may speak for yourself."  Then Paul stretched out his hand, and made his defense.
026:002 "I think myself happy, King Agrippa, that I am to make my  defense before you this day concerning all the things that I  am accused by the Jews,
026:003 especially because you are expert in all customs and  questions which are among the Jews.  Therefore I beg you  to hear me patiently.
026:004 "Indeed, all the Jews know my way of life from my youth up,  which was from the beginning among my own nation and at Jerusalem;
026:005 having known me from the first, if they are willing to testify,  that after the strictest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee.
026:006 Now I stand here to be judged for the hope of the promise made  by God to our fathers,
026:007 which our twelve tribes, earnestly serving night and day,  hope to attain.  Concerning this hope I am accused by  the Jews, King Agrippa!
026:008 Why is it judged incredible with you, if God does raise the dead?
026:009 "I myself most certainly thought that I ought to do many things  contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.
026:010 This I also did in Jerusalem.  I both shut up many of the saints  in prisons, having received authority from the chief priests,  and when they were put to death I gave my vote against them.
026:011 Punishing them often in all the synagogues, I tried to make  them blaspheme.  Being exceedingly enraged against them,  I persecuted them even to foreign cities.
026:012 "Whereupon as I traveled to Damascus with the authority  and commission from the chief priests,
026:013 at noon, O King, I saw on the way a light from the sky,  brighter than the sun, shining around me and those who  traveled with me.
026:014 When we had all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice saying to me  in the Hebrew language, 'Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?  It is hard for you to kick against the goads.'
026:015 "I said, 'Who are you, Lord?'  "He said, 'I am Jesus,  whom you are persecuting.
026:016 But arise, and stand on your feet, for I have appeared to you  for this purpose:  to appoint you a servant and a witness  both of the things which you have seen, and of the things  which I will reveal to you;
026:017 delivering you from the people, and from the Gentiles,  to whom I send you,
026:018 to open their eyes, that they may turn from darkness to light  and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive  remission of sins and an inheritance among those who are  sanctified by faith in me.'
026:019 "Therefore, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to  the heavenly vision,
026:020 but declared first to them of Damascus, at Jerusalem,  and throughout all the country of Judea, and also to the Gentiles,  that they should repent and turn to God, doing works  worthy of repentance.
026:021 For this reason the Jews seized me in the temple, and tried  to kill me.
026:022 Having therefore obtained the help that is from God, I stand  to this day testifying both to small and great, saying nothing  but what the prophets and Moses said would happen,
026:023 how the Christ must suffer, and how, by the resurrection of the dead,  he would be first to proclaim light both to these people  and to the Gentiles."
026:024 As he thus made his defense, Festus said with a loud voice, "Paul,  you are crazy!  Your great learning is driving you insane!"
026:025 But he said, "I am not crazy, most excellent Festus, but boldly  declare words of truth and reasonableness.
026:026 For the king knows of these things, to whom also I speak freely.  For I am persuaded that none of these things is hidden from him,  for this has not been done in a corner.
026:027 King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets?  I know that you believe."
026:028 Agrippa said to Paul, "With a little persuasion are you trying  to make me a Christian?"
026:029 Paul said, "I pray to God, that whether with little or with much,  not only you, but also all that hear me this day, might become  such as I am, except for these bonds."
026:030 The king rose up with the governor, and Bernice, and those  who sat with them.
026:031 When they had withdrawn, they spoke one to another, saying,  "This man does nothing worthy of death or of bonds."
026:032 Agrippa said to Festus, "This man might have been set free  if he had not appealed to Caesar."
026:033 But Peter answered him, "Even if all will be made to stumble  because of you, I will never be made to stumble."
026:034 Jesus said to him, "Most certainly I tell you that tonight,  before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times."
026:035 Peter said to him, "Even if I must die with you, I will not  deny you."  All of the disciples also said likewise.
027:001 When it was determined that we should sail for Italy,  they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners to a centurion  named Julius, of the Augustan band.
027:002 Embarking in a ship of Adramyttium, which was about to sail to places  on the coast of Asia, we put to sea; Aristarchus, a Macedonian  of Thessalonica, being with us.
027:003 The next day, we touched at Sidon.  Julius treated Paul kindly,  and gave him permission to go to his friends and refresh himself.
027:004 Putting to sea from there, we sailed under the lee of Cyprus,  because the winds were contrary.
027:005 When we had sailed across the sea which is off Cilicia  and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, a city of Lycia.
027:006 There the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing for Italy,  and he put us on board.
027:007 When we had sailed slowly many days, and had come with  difficulty opposite Cnidus, the wind not allowing us further,  we sailed under the lee of Crete, opposite Salmone.
027:008 With difficulty sailing along it we came to a certain place  called Fair Havens, near the city of Lasea.
027:009 When much time had passed and the voyage was now dangerous,  because the Fast had now already gone by, Paul admonished them,
027:010 and said to them, "Sirs, I perceive that the voyage will be  with injury and much loss, not only of the cargo and the ship,  but also of our lives."
027:011 But the centurion gave more heed to the master and to the owner  of the ship than to those things which were spoken by Paul.
027:012 Because the haven was not suitable to winter in, the majority  advised going to sea from there, if by any means they could  reach Phoenix, and winter there, which is a port of Crete,  looking northeast and southeast.
027:013 When the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained  their purpose, they weighed anchor and sailed along Crete,  close to shore.
027:014 But before long, a stormy wind beat down from shore, which is  called Euroclydon.{Or, "a northeaster."}
027:015 When the ship was caught, and couldn't face the wind, we gave  way to it, and were driven along.
027:016 Running under the lee of a small island called Clauda,  we were able, with difficulty, to secure the boat.
027:017 After they had hoisted it up, they used cables to help  reinforce the ship.  Fearing that they would run aground  on the Syrtis sand bars, they lowered the sea anchor,  and so were driven along.
027:018 As we labored exceedingly with the storm, the next day they  began to throw things overboard.
027:019 On the third day, they threw out the ship's tackle with  their own hands.
027:020 When neither sun nor stars shone on us for many days,  and no small storm pressed on us, all hope that we would  be saved was now taken away.
027:021 When they had been long without food, Paul stood up in the middle  of them, and said, "Sirs, you should have listened to me,  and not have set sail from Crete, and have gotten this  injury and loss.
027:022 Now I exhort you to cheer up, for there will be no loss of life  among you, but only of the ship.
027:023 For there stood by me this night an angel, belonging to the God  whose I am and whom I serve,
027:024 saying, 'Don't be afraid, Paul.  You must stand before Caesar.  Behold, God has granted you all those who sail with you.'
027:025 Therefore, sirs, cheer up!  For I believe God, that it will  be just as it has been spoken to me.
027:026 But we must run aground on a certain island."
027:027 But when the fourteenth night had come, as we were driven back  and forth in the Adriatic Sea, about midnight the sailors  surmised that they were drawing near to some land.
027:028 They took soundings, and found twenty fathoms.{20 fathoms  = 120 feet = 36.6 meters} After a little while, they took  soundings again, and found fifteen fathoms.{15 fathoms = 90  feet = 27.4 meters}
027:029 Fearing that we would run aground on rocky ground, they let  go four anchors from the stern, and wished for daylight.
027:030 As the sailors were trying to flee out of the ship, and had  lowered the boat into the sea, pretending that they would  lay out anchors from the bow,
027:031 Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, "Unless these  stay in the ship, you can't be saved."
027:032 Then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the boat, and let  it fall off.
027:033 While the day was coming on, Paul begged them all to take  some food, saying, "This day is the fourteenth day that you  wait and continue fasting, having taken nothing.
027:034 Therefore I beg you to take some food, for this is for your safety;  for not a hair will perish from any of your heads."
027:035 When he had said this, and had taken bread, he gave thanks to God  in the presence of all, and he broke it, and began to eat.
027:036 Then they all cheered up, and they also took food.
027:037 In all, we were two hundred seventy-six souls on the ship.
027:038 When they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship,  throwing out the wheat into the sea.
027:039 When it was day, they didn't recognize the land, but they  noticed a certain bay with a beach, and they decided to try  to drive the ship onto it.
027:040 Casting off the anchors, they left them in the sea, at the same  time untying the rudder ropes.  Hoisting up the foresail  to the wind, they made for the beach.
027:041 But coming to a place where two seas met, they ran  the vessel aground.  The bow struck and remained immovable,  but the stern began to break up by the violence of the waves.
027:042 The soldiers' counsel was to kill the prisoners, so that none  of them would swim out and escape.
027:043 But the centurion, desiring to save Paul, stopped them from  their purpose, and commanded that those who could swim should  throw themselves overboard first to go toward the land;
027:044 and the rest should follow, some on planks, and some on other  things from the ship.  So it happened that they all escaped  safely to the land.
027:045 Now from the sixth hour{noon} there was darkness over all  the land until the ninth hour.{3:00 P. M.}
027:046 About the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying,  "Eli, Eli, lima{TR reads "lama" instead of "lima"} sabachthani?"  That is, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"{Psalm 22:1}
028:001 When we had escaped, then they{NU reads "we"} learned that  the island was called Malta.
028:002 The natives showed us uncommon kindness; for they kindled  a fire, and received us all, because of the present rain,  and because of the cold.
028:003 But when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and laid  them on the fire, a viper came out because of the heat,  and fastened on his hand.
028:004 When the natives saw the creature hanging from his hand,  they said one to another, "No doubt this man is a murderer,  whom, though he has escaped from the sea, yet Justice has  not allowed to live."
028:005 However he shook off the creature into the fire, and wasn't harmed.
028:006 But they expected that he would have swollen or fallen  down dead suddenly, but when they watched for a long time  and saw nothing bad happen to him, they changed their minds,  and said that he was a god.
028:007 Now in the neighborhood of that place were lands belonging  to the chief man of the island, named Publius, who received us,  and courteously entertained us for three days.
028:008 It happened that the father of Publius lay sick of fever  and dysentery.  Paul entered in to him, prayed, and laying  his hands on him, healed him.
028:009 Then when this was done, the rest also who had diseases  in the island came, and were cured.
028:010 They also honored us with many honors, and when we sailed,  they put on board the things that we needed.
028:011 After three months, we set sail in a ship of Alexandria which had  wintered in the island, whose sign was "The Twin Brothers."
028:012 Touching at Syracuse, we stayed there three days.
028:013 From there we circled around and arrived at Rhegium.  After one day, a south wind sprang up, and on the second day  we came to Puteoli,
028:014 where we found brothers,{The word for "brothers" here and where  context allows may also be correctly translated "brothers  and sisters" or "siblings."} and were entreated to stay  with them for seven days.  So we came to Rome.
028:015 From there the brothers, when they heard of us, came to meet  us as far as The Market of Appius and The Three Taverns.  When Paul saw them, he thanked God, and took courage.
028:016 When we entered into Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners  to the captain of the guard, but Paul was allowed to stay  by himself with the soldier who guarded him.
028:017 It happened that after three days Paul called together those who  were the leaders of the Jews.  When they had come together,  he said to them, "I, brothers, though I had done nothing  against the people, or the customs of our fathers, still was  delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans,
028:018 who, when they had examined me, desired to set me free,  because there was no cause of death in me.
028:019 But when the Jews spoke against it, I was constrained  to appeal to Caesar, not that I had anything about which to  accuse my nation.
028:020 For this cause therefore I asked to see you and to speak with you.  For because of the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain."
028:021 They said to him, "We neither received letters from Judea  concerning you, nor did any of the brothers come here and report  or speak any evil of you.
028:022 But we desire to hear from you what you think.  For, as concerning  this sect, it is known to us that everywhere it is spoken against."
029:001 In the tenth year, in the tenth month, on the twelfth day  of the month, the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
029:002 "Son of man, set your face against Pharaoh king of Egypt,  and prophesy against him and against all Egypt.
029:003 Speak and say, 'Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  "Behold, I am  against you, Pharaoh king of Egypt, the great monster that lies  in the midst of his rivers, that has said, 'My river is my own,  and I have made it for myself.'
029:004 I will put hooks in your jaws, and I will make the fish  of your rivers stick to your scales; and I will bring you up  out of the midst of your rivers, with all the fish of your  rivers which stick to your scales.
029:005 I'll cast you forth into the wilderness, you and all  the fish of your rivers.  You'll fall on the open field.  You won't be brought together, nor gathered.  I have given  you for food to the animals of the earth and to the birds  of the sky.
029:006 All the inhabitants of Egypt will know that I am Yahweh,  because they have been a staff of reed to the house of Israel.
029:007 When they took hold of you by your hand, you broke, and tore  all their shoulders; and when they leaned on you, you broke,  and paralyzed all of their thighs."
029:008 Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh:  "Behold, I will bring  a sword on you, and will cut off from you man and animal.
029:009 The land of Egypt shall be a desolation and a waste;  and they shall know that I am Yahweh.  Because he has said,  'The river is mine, and I have made it;'
029:010 therefore, behold, I am against you, and against your rivers,  and I will make the land of Egypt an utter waste and desolation,  from the tower of Seveneh even to the border of Ethiopia.
029:011 No foot of man shall pass through it, nor foot of animal shall  pass through it, neither shall it be inhabited forty years.
029:012 I will make the land of Egypt a desolation in the midst  of the countries that are desolate; and her cities among  the cities that are laid waste shall be a desolation forty years;  and I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will  disperse them through the countries."
029:013 For thus says the Lord Yahweh:  "At the end of forty years will I  gather the Egyptians from the peoples where they were scattered;
029:014 and I will bring back the captivity of Egypt, and will cause them  to return into the land of Pathros, into the land of their birth;  and they shall be there a base kingdom.
029:015 It shall be the base of the kingdoms; neither shall it any more  lift itself up above the nations:  and I will diminish them,  that they shall no more rule over the nations.
029:016 It shall be no more the confidence of the house of Israel,  bringing iniquity to memory, when they turn to look after them:  and they shall know that I am the Lord Yahweh."'"
029:017 It came to pass in the seven and twentieth year, in the first [month],  in the first [day] of the month, the word of Yahweh came  to me, saying,
029:018 Son of man, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon caused his army to  serve a great service against Tyre:  every head was made bald,  and every shoulder was worn; yet had he no wages, nor his army,  from Tyre, for the service that he had served against it.
029:019 Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Behold, I will give  the land of Egypt to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon;  and he shall carry off her multitude, and take her spoil,  and take her prey; and it shall be the wages for his army.
029:020 I have given him the land of Egypt as his recompense for which  he served, because they worked for me, says the Lord Yahweh.
029:021 In that day will I cause a horn to bud forth to the house of Israel,  and I will give you the opening of the mouth in the midst of them;  and they shall know that I am Yahweh.
029:022 and of them shall be taken up a curse by all the captives of Judah  who are in Babylon, saying, Yahweh make you like Zedekiah  and like Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire;
029:023 because they have worked folly in Israel, and have committed  adultery with their neighbors' wives, and have spoken  words in my name falsely, which I didn't command them;  and I am he who knows, and am witness, says Yahweh.
029:024 Concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite you shall speak, saying,
029:025 Thus speaks Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, saying,  Because you have sent letters in your own name to all the people  who are at Jerusalem, and to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah,  the priest, and to all the priests, saying,
029:026 Yahweh has made you priest in the place of Jehoiada the priest,  that there may be officers in the house of Yahweh,  for every man who is mad, and makes himself a prophet,  that you should put him in the stocks and in shackles.
029:027 Now therefore, why have you not rebuked Jeremiah of Anathoth,  who makes himself a prophet to you,
029:028 because he has sent to us in Babylon, saying, [The captivity]  is long:  build you houses, and dwell in them; and plant gardens,  and eat the fruit of them?
029:029 Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears of  Jeremiah the prophet.
029:030 Then came the word of Yahweh to Jeremiah, saying,
029:031 Send to all them of the captivity, saying, Thus says Yahweh  concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite:  Because Shemaiah has  prophesied to you, and I didn't send him, and he has caused  you to trust in a lie;
029:032 therefore thus says Yahweh, Behold, I will punish Shemaiah  the Nehelamite, and his seed; he shall not have a man to dwell  among this people, neither shall he see the good that I  will do to my people, says Yahweh, because he has spoken  rebellion against Yahweh.
029:033 The consecrated things were six hundred oxen and  three thousand sheep.
029:034 But the priests were too few, so that they could not flay all  the burnt offerings:  therefore their brothers the Levites  helped them, until the work was ended, and until the priests  had sanctified themselves; for the Levites were more upright  in heart to sanctify themselves than the priests.
029:035 Also the burnt offerings were in abundance, with the fat  of the peace offerings, and with the drink offerings for every  burnt offering.  So the service of the house of Yahweh was  set in order.
030:001 The word of Yahweh came again to me, saying,
030:002 Son of man, prophesy, and say, Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Wail, Alas  for the day!
030:003 For the day is near, even the day of Yahweh is near;  it shall be a day of clouds, a time of the nations.
030:004 A sword shall come on Egypt, and anguish shall be in Ethiopia,  when the slain shall fall in Egypt; and they shall take away  her multitude, and her foundations shall be broken down.
030:005 Ethiopia, and Put, and Lud, and all the mixed people, and Cub,  and the children of the land that is in league, shall fall  with them by the sword.
030:006 Thus says Yahweh:  They also who uphold Egypt shall fall;  and the pride of her power shall come down:  from the tower of Seveneh shall they fall in it by the sword,  says the Lord Yahweh.
030:007 They shall be desolate in the midst of the countries that  are desolate; and her cities shall be in the midst of the cities  that are wasted.
030:008 They shall know that I am Yahweh, when I have set a fire in Egypt,  and all her helpers are destroyed.
030:009 In that day shall messengers go forth from before me in ships  to make the careless Ethiopians afraid; and there shall be  anguish on them, as in the day of Egypt; for, behold, it comes.
030:010 Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  I will also make the multitude of  Egypt to cease, by the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon.
030:011 He and his people with him, the terrible of the nations,  shall be brought in to destroy the land; and they shall draw  their swords against Egypt, and fill the land with the slain.
030:012 I will make the rivers dry, and will sell the land into  the hand of evil men; and I will make the land desolate,  and all that is therein, by the hand of strangers:  I, Yahweh, have spoken it.
030:013 Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  I will also destroy the idols,  and I will cause the images to cease from Memphis;  and there shall be no more a prince from the land of Egypt:  and I will put a fear in the land of Egypt.
030:014 I will make Pathros desolate, and will set a fire in Zoan,  and will execute judgments on No.
030:015 I will pour my wrath on Sin, the stronghold of Egypt;  and I will cut off the multitude of No.
030:016 I will set a fire in Egypt:  Sin shall be in great anguish,  and No shall be broken up; and Memphis [shall have] adversaries  in the daytime.
030:017 The young men of Aven and of Pibeseth shall fall by the sword;  and these [cities] shall go into captivity.
030:018 At Tehaphnehes also the day shall withdraw itself, when I shall  break there the yokes of Egypt, and the pride of her power  shall cease in her:  as for her, a cloud shall cover her,  and her daughters shall go into captivity.
030:019 Thus will I execute judgments on Egypt; and they shall know  that I am Yahweh.
030:020 It happened in the eleventh year, in the first [month],  in the seventh [day] of the month, that the word of Yahweh  came to me, saying,
030:021 Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh king of Egypt;  and behold, it has not been bound up, to apply [healing] medicines,  to put a bandage to bind it, that it be strong to hold the sword.
030:022 Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Behold, I am against Pharaoh  king of Egypt, and will break his arms, the strong [arm],  and that which was broken; and I will cause the sword to fall  out of his hand.
030:023 I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and will disperse  them through the countries.
030:024 I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and put  my sword in his hand:  but I will break the arms of Pharaoh,  and he shall groan before him with the groanings of a  deadly wounded man.
030:025 I will hold up the arms of the king of Babylon; and the arms  of Pharaoh shall fall down; and they shall know that I am Yahweh,  when I shall put my sword into the hand of the king of Babylon,  and he shall stretch it out on the land of Egypt.
030:026 I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and disperse them  through the countries; and they shall know that I am Yahweh.
030:027 Behold, the name of Yahweh comes from far away, burning with  his anger, and in thick rising smoke.  His lips are full  of indignation, and his tongue is as a devouring fire.
030:028 His breath is as an overflowing stream that reaches even to  the neck, to sift the nations with the sieve of destruction;  and a bridle that leads to ruin will be in the jaws  of the peoples.
030:029 You will have a song, as in the night when a holy feast is kept;  and gladness of heart, as when one goes with a flute to come  to Yahweh's mountain, to Israel's Rock.
030:030 Yahweh will cause his glorious voice to be heard, and will show  the descent of his arm, with the indignation of his anger,  and the flame of a devouring fire, with a blast,  storm, and hailstones.
030:031 For through the voice of Yahweh the Assyrian will be dismayed.  He will strike him with his rod.
030:032 Every stroke of the rod of punishment, which Yahweh will lay  on him, will be with the sound of tambourines and harps.  He will fight with them in battles, brandishing weapons.
030:033 For his burning place has long been ready.  Yes, for the king  it is made ready.  He has made its pyre deep and large  with fire and much wood.  Yahweh's breath, like a stream  of sulfur, kindles it.
030:034 Yahweh said to Moses, "Take to yourself sweet spices, gum resin,  and onycha, and galbanum; sweet spices with pure frankincense:  of each shall there be an equal weight;
030:035 and you shall make incense of it, a perfume after the art  of the perfumer, seasoned with salt, pure and holy:
030:036 and you shall beat some of it very small, and put some of it before  the testimony in the tent of meeting, where I will meet with you.  It shall be to you most holy.
030:037 The incense which you shall make, according to its composition  you shall not make for yourselves:  it shall be to you  holy for Yahweh.
030:038 Whoever shall make any like that, to smell of it, he shall  be cut off from his people."
030:039 The flocks conceived before the rods, and the flocks brought  forth streaked, speckled, and spotted.
030:040 Jacob separated the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks  toward the streaked and all the black in the flock of Laban:  and he put his own droves apart, and didn't put them  into Laban's flock.
030:041 It happened, whenever the stronger of the flock conceived,  that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the flock  in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods;
030:042 but when the flock were feeble, he didn't put them in.  So the feebler were Laban's, and the stronger Jacob's.
030:043 The man increased exceedingly, and had large flocks,  female servants and male servants, and camels and donkeys.
031:001 It happened in the eleventh year, in the third [month],  in the first [day] of the month, that the word of Yahweh came  to me, saying,
031:002 Son of man, tell Pharaoh king of Egypt, and to his multitude:  Whom are you like in your greatness?
031:003 Behold, the Assyrian was a cedar in Lebanon with beautiful  branches, and with a forest-like shade, and of high stature;  and its top was among the thick boughs.
031:004 The waters nourished it, the deep made it to grow:  the rivers of it ran round about its plantation; and it sent  out its channels to all the trees of the field.
031:005 Therefore its stature was exalted above all the trees of the field;  and its boughs were multiplied, and its branches became long  by reason of many waters, when it shot [them] forth.
031:006 All the birds of the sky made their nests in its boughs;  and under its branches did all the animals of the field bring  forth their young; and under its shadow lived all great nations.
031:007 Thus was it beautiful in its greatness, in the length of its branches;  for its root was by many waters.
031:008 The cedars in the garden of God could not hide it; the fir  trees were not like its boughs, and the plane trees were  not as its branches; nor was any tree in the garden of God  like it in its beauty.
031:009 I made it beautiful by the multitude of its branches,  so that all the trees of Eden, that were in the garden  of God, envied it.
031:010 Therefore thus said the Lord Yahweh:  Because you are exalted  in stature, and he has set his top among the thick boughs,  and his heart is lifted up in his height;
031:011 I will even deliver him into the hand of the mighty one of  the nations; he shall surely deal with him; I have driven  him out for his wickedness.
031:012 Strangers, the terrible of the nations, have cut him off,  and have left him:  on the mountains and in all the valleys  his branches are fallen, and his boughs are broken by all  the watercourses of the land; and all the peoples of the earth  are gone down from his shadow, and have left him.
031:013 On his ruin all the birds of the sky shall dwell, and all  the animals of the field shall be on his branches;
031:014 to the end that none of all the trees by the waters exalt themselves  in their stature, neither set their top among the thick boughs,  nor that their mighty ones stand up on their height,  [even] all who drink water:  for they are all delivered to death,  to the lower parts of the earth, in the midst of the children  of men, with those who go down to the pit.
031:015 Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  In the day when he went down to  Sheol I caused a mourning:  I covered the deep for him, and I  restrained the rivers of it; and the great waters were stayed;  and I caused Lebanon to mourn for him, and all the trees  of the field fainted for him.
031:016 I made the nations to shake at the sound of his fall, when I  cast him down to Sheol with those who descend into the pit;  and all the trees of Eden, the choice and best of Lebanon,  all that drink water, were comforted in the lower parts  of the earth.
031:017 They also went down into Sheol with him to those who are slain  by the sword; yes, those who were his arm, [that] lived  under his shadow in the midst of the nations.
031:018 To whom are you thus like in glory and in greatness among the trees  of Eden? yet shall you be brought down with the trees of Eden  to the lower parts of the earth:  you shall lie in the midst  of the uncircumcised, with those who are slain by the sword.  This is Pharaoh and all his multitude, says the Lord Yahweh.
031:019 Surely after that I was turned, I repented; and after that I  was instructed, I struck on my thigh:  I was ashamed, yes,  even confounded, because I did bear the reproach of my youth.
031:020 Is Ephraim my dear son? is he a darling child? for as often  as I speak against him, I do earnestly remember him still:  therefore my heart yearns for him; I will surely have mercy  on him, says Yahweh.
031:021 Set up road signs, make guideposts; set your heart toward  the highway, even the way by which you went:  turn again,  virgin of Israel, turn again to these your cities.
031:022 How long will you go here and there, you backsliding  daughter? for Yahweh has created a new thing in the earth:  a woman shall encompass a man.
031:023 Thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, Yet again shall they  use this speech in the land of Judah and in the cities of it,  when I shall bring again their captivity:  Yahweh bless you,  habitation of righteousness, mountain of holiness.
031:024 Judah and all the cities of it shall dwell therein together,  the farmers, and those who go about with flocks.
031:025 For I have satiated the weary soul, and every sorrowful soul  have I replenished.
031:026 On this I awakened, and saw; and my sleep was sweet to me.
031:027 Behold, the days come, says Yahweh, that I will sow the house  of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man,  and with the seed of animal.
031:028 It shall happen that, like as I have watched over them to pluck up  and to break down and to overthrow and to destroy and to afflict,  so will I watch over them to build and to plant, says Yahweh.
031:029 In those days they shall say no more, The fathers have eaten  sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge.
031:030 But everyone shall die for his own iniquity:  every man who eats  the sour grapes, his teeth shall be set on edge.
031:031 Behold, the days come, says Yahweh, that I will make a new  covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah:
031:032 not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers  in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them  out of the land of Egypt; which my covenant they broke,  although I was a husband to them, says Yahweh.
031:033 But this is the covenant that I will make with the house  of Israel after those days, says Yahweh:  I will put my law  in their inward parts, and in their heart will I write it;  and I will be their God, and they shall be my people:
031:034 and they shall teach no more every man his neighbor, and every man  his brother, saying, Know Yahweh; for they shall all know me,  from the least of them to the greatest of them, says Yahweh:  for I will forgive their iniquity, and their sin will I  remember no more.
031:035 Thus says Yahweh, who gives the sun for a light by day,  and the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light  by night, who stirs up the sea, so that the waves of it roar;  Yahweh of Armies is his name:
031:036 If these ordinances depart from before me, says Yahweh,  then the seed of Israel also shall cease from being a nation  before me forever.
031:037 Thus says Yahweh:  If heaven above can be measured,  and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath,  then will I also cast off all the seed of Israel for all  that they have done, says Yahweh.
031:038 Behold, the days come, says Yahweh, that the city shall be built  to Yahweh from the tower of Hananel to the gate of the corner.
031:039 The measuring line shall go out further straight onward  to the hill Gareb, and shall turn about to Goah.
031:040 The whole valley of the dead bodies and of the ashes,  and all the fields to the brook Kidron, to the corner  of the horse gate toward the east, shall be holy to Yahweh;  it shall not be plucked up, nor thrown down any more forever.
031:041 Moses gave the tribute, which was Yahweh's wave offering,  to Eleazar the priest, as Yahweh commanded Moses.
031:042 Of the children of Israel's half, which Moses divided off  from the men who warred
031:043 (now the congregation's half was three hundred thirty-seven  thousand five hundred sheep,
031:044 and thirty-six thousand oxen,
031:045 and thirty thousand five hundred donkeys,
031:046 and sixteen thousand persons),
031:047 even of the children of Israel's half, Moses took one drawn  out of every fifty, both of man and of animal, and gave them  to the Levites, who kept the charge of the tent of Yahweh;  as Yahweh commanded Moses.
031:048 The officers who were over the thousands of the army,  the captains of thousands, and the captains of hundreds,  came near to Moses;
031:049 and they said to Moses, Your servants have taken the sum  of the men of war who are under our charge, and there lacks  not one man of us.
031:050 We have brought Yahweh's offering, what every man has gotten,  of jewels of gold, armlets, and bracelets, signet rings, earrings,  and necklaces, to make atonement for our souls before Yahweh.
031:051 Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of them,  even all worked jewels.
031:052 All the gold of the wave offering that they offered up to Yahweh,  of the captains of thousands, and of the captains of hundreds,  was sixteen thousand seven hundred fifty shekels.
031:053 ([For] the men of war had taken booty, every man for himself.)
031:054 Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains of  thousands and of hundreds, and brought it into the tent of meeting,  for a memorial for the children of Israel before Yahweh.
031:055 Early in the morning, Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and  his daughters, and blessed them.  Laban departed and returned  to his place.
032:001 It happened in the twelfth year, in the twelfth month,  in the first [day] of the month, that the word of Yahweh came  to me, saying,
032:002 Son of man, take up a lamentation over Pharaoh king of Egypt,  and tell him, You were likened to a young lion of the nations:  yet are you as a monster in the seas; and you did break forth  with your rivers, and troubled the waters with your feet,  and fouled their rivers.
032:003 Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  I will spread out my net on you  with a company of many peoples; and they shall bring you up  in my net.
032:004 I will leave you on the land, I will cast you forth on the open field,  and will cause all the birds of the sky to settle on you,  and I will satisfy the animals of the whole earth with you.
032:005 I will lay your flesh on the mountains, and fill the valleys  with your height.
032:006 I will also water with your blood the land in which you swim,  even to the mountains; and the watercourses shall be full of you.
032:007 When I shall extinguish you, I will cover the heavens, and make  the stars of it dark; I will cover the sun with a cloud,  and the moon shall not give its light.
032:008 All the bright lights of the sky will I make dark over you,  and set darkness on your land, says the Lord Yahweh.
032:009 I will also vex the hearts of many peoples, when I shall  bring your destruction among the nations, into the countries  which you have not known.
032:010 Yes, I will make many peoples amazed at you, and their kings  shall be horribly afraid for you, when I shall brandish my  sword before them; and they shall tremble at every moment,  every man for his own life, in the day of your fall.
032:011 For thus says the Lord Yahweh:  The sword of the king of Babylon  shall come on you.
032:012 By the swords of the mighty will I cause your multitude to fall;  the terrible of the nations are they all:  and they shall  bring to nothing the pride of Egypt, and all the multitude  of it shall be destroyed.
032:013 I will destroy also all the animals of it from beside many waters;  neither shall the foot of man trouble them any more,  nor the hoofs of animals trouble them.
032:014 Then will I make their waters clear, and cause their rivers  to run like oil, says the Lord Yahweh.
032:015 When I shall make the land of Egypt desolate and waste,  a land destitute of that of which it was full, when I shall  strike all those who dwell therein, then shall they know  that I am Yahweh.
032:016 This is the lamentation with which they shall lament;  the daughters of the nations shall lament therewith; over Egypt,  and over all her multitude, shall they lament therewith,  says the Lord Yahweh.
032:017 It happened also in the twelfth year, in the fifteenth [day]  of the month, that the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
032:018 Son of man, wail for the multitude of Egypt, and cast them down,  even her, and the daughters of the famous nations, to the lower  parts of the earth, with those who go down into the pit.
032:019 Whom do you pass in beauty?  Go down, and be laid  with the uncircumcised.
032:020 They shall fall in the midst of those who are slain by the sword:  she is delivered to the sword; draw her away and all her multitudes.
032:021 The strong among the mighty shall speak to him out of the midst  of Sheol with those who help him:  they are gone down,  they lie still, even the uncircumcised, slain by the sword.
032:022 Asshur is there and all her company; her graves are round about her;  all of them slain, fallen by the sword;
032:023 whose graves are set in the uttermost parts of the pit,  and her company is round about her grave; all of them slain,  fallen by the sword, who caused terror in the land of the living.
032:024 There is Elam and all her multitude round about her grave;  all of them slain, fallen by the sword, who are gone down  uncircumcised into the lower parts of the earth, who caused  their terror in the land of the living, and have borne their  shame with those who go down to the pit.
032:025 They have set her a bed in the midst of the slain  with all her multitude; her graves are round about her;  all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword; for their  terror was caused in the land of the living, and they  have borne their shame with those who go down to the pit:  he is put in the midst of those who are slain.
032:026 There is Meshech, Tubal, and all their multitude; their graves are  round about them; all of them uncircumcised, slain by the sword;  for they caused their terror in the land of the living.
032:027 They shall not lie with the mighty who are fallen of  the uncircumcised, who are gone down to Sheol with their  weapons of war, and have laid their swords under their heads,  and their iniquities are on their bones; for [they were]  the terror of the mighty in the land of the living.
032:028 But you shall be broken in the midst of the uncircumcised,  and shall lie with those who are slain by the sword.
032:029 There is Edom, her kings and all her princes, who in their  might are laid with those who are slain by the sword:  they shall lie with the uncircumcised, and with those who go  down to the pit.
032:030 There are the princes of the north, all of them, and all  the Sidonians, who are gone down with the slain; in the terror  which they caused by their might they are put to shame;  and they lie uncircumcised with those who are slain by the sword,  and bear their shame with those who go down to the pit.
032:031 Pharaoh shall see them, and shall be comforted over all  his multitude, even Pharaoh and all his army, slain by the sword,  says the Lord Yahweh.
032:032 For I have put his terror in the land of the living;  and he shall be laid in the midst of the uncircumcised,  with those who are slain by the sword, even Pharaoh and all  his multitude, says the Lord Yahweh.
033:001 The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
033:002 Son of man, speak to the children of your people, and tell them,  When I bring the sword on a land, and the people of the land  take a man from among them, and set him for their watchman;
033:003 if, when he sees the sword come on the land, he blow the trumpet,  and warn the people;
033:004 then whoever hears the sound of the trumpet, and doesn't  take warning, if the sword come, and take him away, his blood  shall be on his own head.
033:005 He heard the sound of the trumpet, and didn't take warning;  his blood shall be on him; whereas if he had taken warning,  he would have delivered his soul.
033:006 But if the watchman sees the sword come, and doesn't blow the trumpet,  and the people aren't warned, and the sword comes, and take  any person from among them; he is taken away in his iniquity,  but his blood will I require at the watchman's hand.
033:007 So you, son of man, I have set you a watchman to the house  of Israel; therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them  warning from me.
033:008 When I tell the wicked, O wicked man, you shall surely die,  and you don't speak to warn the wicked from his way;  that wicked man shall die in his iniquity, but his blood  will I require at your hand.
033:009 Nevertheless, if you warn the wicked of his way to turn from it,  and he doesn't turn from his way; he shall die in his iniquity,  but you have delivered your soul.
033:010 You, son of man, tell the house of Israel:  Thus you speak,  saying, Our transgressions and our sins are on us, and we  pine away in them; how then can we live?
033:011 Tell them, As I live, says the Lord Yahweh, I have no pleasure  in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from  his way and live:  turn you, turn you from your evil ways;  for why will you die, house of Israel?
033:012 You, son of man, tell the children of your people,  The righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him in the day  of his disobedience; and as for the wickedness of the wicked,  he shall not fall thereby in the day that he turns from  his wickedness; neither shall he who is righteous be able  to live thereby in the day that he sins.
033:013 When I tell the righteous, that he shall surely live;  if he trust to his righteousness, and commit iniquity,  none of his righteous deeds shall be remembered; but in his  iniquity that he has committed, therein shall he die.
033:014 Again, when I say to the wicked, You shall surely die;  if he turn from his sin, and do that which is lawful and right;
033:015 if the wicked restore the pledge, give again that which he had taken  by robbery, walk in the statutes of life, committing no iniquity;  he shall surely live, he shall not die.
033:016 None of his sins that he has committed shall be remembered  against him:  he has done that which is lawful and right;  he shall surely live.
033:017 Yet the children of your people say, The way of the Lord  is not equal:  but as for them, their way is not equal.
033:018 When the righteous turns from his righteousness, and commits iniquity,  he shall even die therein.
033:019 When the wicked turns from his wickedness, and does that which  is lawful and right, he shall live thereby.
033:020 Yet you say, The way of the Lord is not equal.  House of Israel, I will judge you everyone after his ways.
034:001 The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
034:002 Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds of Israel,  prophesy, and tell them, even to the shepherds, Thus says the  Lord Yahweh:  Woe to the shepherds of Israel who feed themselves!  Shouldn't the shepherds feed the sheep?
034:003 You eat the fat, and you clothe you with the wool, you kill  the fatlings; but you don't feed the sheep.
034:004 You haven't strengthened the diseased, neither have you healed  that which was sick, neither have you bound up that which  was broken, neither have you brought back that which was  driven away, neither have you sought that which was lost;  but with force and with rigor have you ruled over them.
034:005 They were scattered, because there was no shepherd;  and they became food to all the animals of the field,  and were scattered.
034:006 My sheep wandered through all the mountains, and on every high hill:  yes, my sheep were scattered on all the surface of the earth;  and there was none who searched or sought.
034:007 Therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of Yahweh:
034:008 As I live, says the Lord Yahweh, surely because my sheep became  a prey, and my sheep became food to all the animals of the field,  because there was no shepherd, neither did my shepherds  search for my sheep, but the shepherds fed themselves,  and didn't feed my sheep;
034:009 therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of Yahweh:
034:010 Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Behold, I am against the shepherds;  and I will require my sheep at their hand, and cause them  to cease from feeding the sheep; neither shall the shepherds  feed themselves any more; and I will deliver my sheep from  their mouth, that they may not be food for them.
034:011 For thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Behold, I myself, even I,  will search for my sheep, and will seek them out.
034:012 As a shepherd seeks out his flock in the day that he is among  his sheep that are scattered abroad, so will I seek out my sheep;  and I will deliver them out of all places where they have been  scattered in the cloudy and dark day.
034:013 I will bring them out from the peoples, and gather them from  the countries, and will bring them into their own land; and I  will feed them on the mountains of Israel, by the watercourses,  and in all the inhabited places of the country.
034:014 I will feed them with good pasture; and on the mountains  of the height of Israel shall their fold be:  there shall  they lie down in a good fold; and on fat pasture shall they  feed on the mountains of Israel.
034:015 I myself will be the shepherd of my sheep, and I will cause  them to lie down, says the Lord Yahweh.
034:016 I will seek that which was lost, and will bring back  that which was driven away, and will bind up that which  was broken, and will strengthen that which was sick:  but the fat and the strong I will destroy; I will feed  them in justice.
034:017 As for you, O my flock, thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Behold, I judge  between sheep and sheep, the rams and the male goats.
034:018 Seems it a small thing to you to have fed on the good pasture,  but you must tread down with your feet the residue of your  pasture? and to have drunk of the clear waters, but you must  foul the residue with your feet?
034:019 As for my sheep, they eat that which you have trodden with your feet,  and they drink that which you have fouled with your feet.
034:020 Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh to them:  Behold, I, even I,  will judge between the fat sheep and the lean sheep.
034:021 Because you thrust with side and with shoulder, and push all  the diseased with your horns, until you have scattered them abroad;
034:022 therefore will I save my flock, and they shall no more be a prey;  and I will judge between sheep and sheep.
034:023 I will set up one shepherd over them, and he shall feed them,  even my servant David; he shall feed them, and he shall  be their shepherd.
034:024 I, Yahweh, will be their God, and my servant David prince  among them; I, Yahweh, have spoken it.
034:025 I will make with them a covenant of peace, and will cause  evil animals to cease out of the land; and they shall dwell  securely in the wilderness, and sleep in the woods.
034:026 I will make them and the places round about my hill a blessing;  and I will cause the shower to come down in its season;  there shall be showers of blessing.
034:027 The tree of the field shall yield its fruit, and the earth shall  yield its increase, and they shall be secure in their land;  and they shall know that I am Yahweh, when I have broken  the bars of their yoke, and have delivered them out of the hand  of those who made slaves of them.
034:028 They shall no more be a prey to the nations, neither shall  the animals of the earth devour them; but they shall dwell securely,  and none shall make them afraid.
034:029 I will raise up to them a plantation for renown, and they shall  be no more consumed with famine in the land, neither bear  the shame of the nations any more.
034:030 They shall know that I, Yahweh, their God am with them,  and that they, the house of Israel, are my people,  says the Lord Yahweh.
034:031 You my sheep, the sheep of my pasture, are men, and I am your God,  says the Lord Yahweh.
035:001 Moreover the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
035:002 Son of man, set your face against Mount Seir, and prophesy against it,
035:003 and tell it, Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Behold, I am against you,  Mount Seir, and I will stretch out my hand against you,  and I will make you a desolation and an astonishment.
035:004 I will lay your cities waste, and you shall be desolate;  and you shall know that I am Yahweh.
035:005 Because you have had a perpetual enmity, and have given over  the children of Israel to the power of the sword in the time  of their calamity, in the time of the iniquity of the end;
035:006 therefore, as I live, says the Lord Yahweh, I will prepare  you to blood, and blood shall pursue you:  since you have  not hated blood, therefore blood shall pursue you.
035:007 Thus will I make Mount Seir an astonishment and a desolation;  and I will cut off from it him who passes through and  him who returns.
035:008 I will fill its mountains with its slain:  in your hills  and in your valleys and in all your watercourses shall they  fall who are slain with the sword.
035:009 I will make you a perpetual desolation, and your cities shall  not be inhabited; and you shall know that I am Yahweh.
035:010 Because you have said, These two nations and these two countries  shall be mine, and we will possess it; whereas Yahweh was there:
035:011 therefore, as I live, says the Lord Yahweh, I will do according  to your anger, and according to your envy which you have shown  out of your hatred against them; and I will make myself known  among them, when I shall judge you.
035:012 You shall know that I, Yahweh, have heard all your insults  which you have spoken against the mountains of Israel, saying,  They are laid desolate, they are given us to devour.
035:013 You have magnified yourselves against me with your mouth,  and have multiplied your words against me:  I have heard it.
035:014 Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  When the whole earth rejoices,  I will make you desolate.
035:015 As you did rejoice over the inheritance of the house  of Israel, because it was desolate, so will I do to you:  you shall be desolate, Mount Seir, and all Edom, even all of it;  and they shall know that I am Yahweh.
035:016 Because the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have performed  the commandment of their father which he commanded them,  but this people has not listened to me;
035:017 therefore thus says Yahweh, the God of Armies, the God  of Israel:  Behold, I will bring on Judah and on all the inhabitants  of Jerusalem all the evil that I have pronounced against them;  because I have spoken to them, but they have not heard;  and I have called to them, but they have not answered.
035:018 Jeremiah said to the house of the Rechabites, Thus says Yahweh  of Armies, the God of Israel:  Because you have obeyed the  commandment of Jonadab your father, and kept all his precepts,  and done according to all that he commanded you;
035:019 therefore thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel:  Jonadab the  son of Rechab shall not want a man to stand before me forever.
035:020 For they don't speak peace, but they devise deceitful words  against those who are quiet in the land.
035:021 Yes, they opened their mouth wide against me.  They said, "Aha!  Aha!  Our eye has seen it!"
035:022 You have seen it, Yahweh.  Don't keep silent.  Lord, don't be  far from me.
035:023 Wake up!  Rise up to defend me, my God!  My Lord, contend for me!
035:024 Vindicate me, Yahweh my God, according to your righteousness.  Don't let them gloat over me.
035:025 Don't let them say in their heart, "Aha!  That's the way we want it!"  Don't let them say, "We have swallowed him up!"
035:026 Let them be disappointed and confounded together who rejoice  at my calamity.  Let them be clothed with shame and dishonor  who magnify themselves against me.
035:027 Let them shout for joy and be glad, who favor my righteous cause.  Yes, let them say continually, "Yahweh be magnified, who has  pleasure in the prosperity of his servant!"
035:028 My tongue shall talk about your righteousness and about your  praise all day long.
035:029 These things shall be for a statute [and] ordinance to you  throughout your generations in all your dwellings.
036:001 You, son of man, prophesy to the mountains of Israel, and say,  You mountains of Israel, hear the word of Yahweh.
036:002 Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Because the enemy has said against you,  Aha! and, The ancient high places are ours in possession;
036:003 therefore prophesy, and say, Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Because, even  because they have made you desolate, and swallowed you up  on every side, that you might be a possession to the residue  of the nations, and you are taken up in the lips of talkers,  and the evil report of the people;
036:004 therefore, you mountains of Israel, hear the word of the  Lord Yahweh:  Thus says the Lord Yahweh to the mountains  and to the hills, to the watercourses and to the valleys,  to the desolate wastes and to the cities that are forsaken,  which are become a prey and derision to the residue of the nations  that are round about;
036:005 therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Surely in the fire of my  jealousy have I spoken against the residue of the nations,  and against all Edom, that have appointed my land to themselves  for a possession with the joy of all their heart, with despite  of soul, to cast it out for a prey.
036:006 Therefore prophesy concerning the land of Israel, and tell  the mountains and to the hills, to the watercourses and to  the valleys, Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Behold, I have spoken  in my jealousy and in my wrath, because you have borne  the shame of the nations:
036:007 therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh:  I have sworn, [saying],  Surely the nations that are round about you, they shall  bear their shame.
036:008 But you, mountains of Israel, you shall shoot forth your branches,  and yield your fruit to my people Israel; for they are at  hand to come.
036:009 For, behold, I am for you, and I will turn into you, and you  shall be tilled and sown;
036:010 and I will multiply men on you, all the house of Israel,  even all of it; and the cities shall be inhabited, and the waste  places shall be built;
036:011 and I will multiply on you man and animal; and they shall increase  and be fruitful; and I will cause you to be inhabited after your  former estate, and will do better [to you] than at your beginnings:  and you shall know that I am Yahweh.
036:012 Yes, I will cause men to walk on you, even my people Israel;  and they shall possess you, and you shall be their inheritance,  and you shall no more henceforth bereave them of children.
036:013 Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Because they say to you,  You [land] are a devourer of men, and have been a bereaver  of your nation;
036:014 therefore you shall devour men no more, neither bereave your  nation any more, says the Lord Yahweh;
036:015 neither will I let you hear any more the shame of the nations,  neither shall you bear the reproach of the peoples any more,  neither shall you cause your nation to stumble any more,  says the Lord Yahweh.
036:016 Moreover the word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
036:017 Son of man, when the house of Israel lived in their own land,  they defiled it by their way and by their doings:  their way before me was as the uncleanness of a woman  in her impurity.
036:018 Therefore I poured out my wrath on them for the blood which they  had poured out on the land, and because they had defiled it  with their idols;
036:019 and I scattered them among the nations, and they were dispersed  through the countries:  according to their way and according  to their doings I judged them.
036:020 When they came to the nations, where they went, they profaned  my holy name; in that men said of them, These are the people  of Yahweh, and are gone forth out of his land.
036:021 But I had regard for my holy name, which the house of Israel  had profaned among the nations, where they went.
036:022 Therefore tell the house of Israel, Thus says the  Lord Yahweh:  I don't do [this] for your sake, house of Israel,  but for my holy name, which you have profaned among the nations,  where you went.
036:023 I will sanctify my great name, which has been profaned among  the nations, which you have profaned in the midst of them;  and the nations shall know that I am Yahweh, says the Lord Yahweh,  when I shall be sanctified in you before their eyes.
036:024 For I will take you from among the nations, and gather you out  of all the countries, and will bring you into your own land.
036:025 I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you shall be clean:  from all your filthiness, and from all your idols,  will I cleanse you.
036:026 A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put  within you; and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh,  and I will give you a heart of flesh.
036:027 I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in  my statutes, and you shall keep my ordinances, and do them.
036:028 You shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers;  and you shall be my people, and I will be your God.
036:029 I will save you from all your uncleanness:  and I will call  for the grain, and will multiply it, and lay no famine on you.
036:030 I will multiply the fruit of the tree, and the increase  of the field, that you may receive no more the reproach  of famine among the nations.
036:031 Then shall you remember your evil ways, and your doings that  were not good; and you shall loathe yourselves in your own  sight for your iniquities and for your abominations.
036:032 Nor for your sake do I [this], says the Lord Yahweh, be it  known to you:  be ashamed and confounded for your ways,  house of Israel.
036:033 Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  In the day that I cleanse you from  all your iniquities, I will cause the cities to be inhabited,  and the waste places shall be built.
036:034 The land that was desolate shall be tilled, whereas it was  a desolation in the sight of all who passed by.
036:035 They shall say, This land that was desolate is become like  the garden of Eden; and the waste and desolate and ruined  cities are fortified and inhabited.
036:036 Then the nations that are left round about you shall know  that I, Yahweh, have built the ruined places, and planted  that which was desolate:  I, Yahweh, have spoken it, and I  will do it.
036:037 Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  For this, moreover, will I  be inquired of by the house of Israel, to do it for them:  I will increase them with men like a flock.
036:038 As the flock for sacrifice, as the flock of Jerusalem in her  appointed feasts, so shall the waste cities be filled with  flocks of men; and they shall know that I am Yahweh.
036:039 Baal Hanan the son of Achbor died, and Hadar reigned in his place.  The name of his city was Pau.  His wife's name was Mehetabel,  the daughter of Matred, the daughter of Mezahab.
036:040 These are the names of the chiefs who came from Esau, according to  their families, after their places, and by their names:  chief Timna, chief Alvah, chief Jetheth,
036:041 chief Oholibamah, chief Elah, chief Pinon,
036:042 chief Kenaz, chief Teman, chief Mibzar,
036:043 chief Magdiel, and chief Iram.  These are the chiefs of Edom,  according to their habitations in the land of their possession.  This is Esau, the father of the Edomites.
037:001 The hand of Yahweh was on me, and he brought me out in the Spirit  of Yahweh, and set me down in the midst of the valley;  and it was full of bones.
037:002 He caused me to pass by them round about:  and behold,  there were very many in the open valley; and behold,  they were very dry.
037:003 He said to me, Son of man, can these bones live?  I answered,  Lord Yahweh, you know.
037:004 Again he said to me, Prophesy over these bones, and tell them,  you dry bones, hear the word of Yahweh.
037:005 Thus says the Lord Yahweh to these bones:  Behold, I will cause  breath to enter into you, and you shall live.
037:006 I will lay sinews on you, and will bring up flesh on you,  and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and you shall live;  and you shall know that I am Yahweh.
037:007 So I prophesied as I was commanded:  and as I prophesied,  there was a noise, and behold, an earthquake; and the bones  came together, bone to its bone.
037:008 I saw, and, behold, there were sinews on them, and flesh came up,  and skin covered them above; but there was no breath in them.
037:009 Then said he to me, Prophesy to the wind, prophesy, son of man,  and tell the wind, Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Come from  the four winds, breath, and breathe on these slain,  that they may live.
037:010 So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came  into them, and they lived, and stood up on their feet,  an exceedingly great army.
037:011 Then he said to me, Son of man, these bones are the whole  house of Israel:  behold, they say, Our bones are dried up,  and our hope is lost; we are clean cut off.
037:012 Therefore prophesy, and tell them, Thus says the  Lord Yahweh:  Behold, I will open your graves, and cause you  to come up out of your graves, my people; and I will bring  you into the land of Israel.
037:013 You shall know that I am Yahweh, when I have opened your graves,  and caused you to come up out of your graves, my people.
037:014 I will put my Spirit in you, and you shall live, and I will place  you in your own land:  and you shall know that I, Yahweh,  have spoken it and performed it, says Yahweh.
037:015 The word of Yahweh came again to me, saying,
037:016 You, son of man, take one stick, and write on it, For Judah,  and for the children of Israel his companions:  then take  another stick, and write on it, For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim,  and [for] all the house of Israel his companions:
037:017 and join them for you one to another into one stick, that they  may become one in your hand.
037:018 When the children of your people shall speak to you, saying,  Will you not show us what you mean by these?
037:019 tell them, Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Behold, I will take  the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim,  and the tribes of Israel his companions; and I will put them  with it, [even] with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick,  and they shall be one in my hand.
037:020 The sticks whereon you write shall be in your hand before their eyes.
037:021 Say to them, Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Behold, I will take  the children of Israel from among the nations, where they  are gone, and will gather them on every side, and bring them  into their own land:
037:022 and I will make them one nation in the land, on the mountains  of Israel; and one king shall be king to them all; and they  shall be no more two nations, neither shall they be divided  into two kingdoms any more at all;
037:023 neither shall they defile themselves any more with their idols,  nor with their detestable things, nor with any of  their transgressions; but I will save them out of all their  dwelling places, in which they have sinned, and will cleanse them:  so shall they be my people, and I will be their God.
037:024 My servant David shall be king over them; and they all shall  have one shepherd:  they shall also walk in my ordinances,  and observe my statutes, and do them.
037:025 They shall dwell in the land that I have given to Jacob my servant,  in which your fathers lived; and they shall dwell therein, they,  and their children, and their children's children, forever:  and David my servant shall be their prince for ever.
037:026 Moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them; it shall  be an everlasting covenant with them; and I will place them,  and multiply them, and will set my sanctuary in the midst  of them forevermore.
037:027 My tent also shall be with them; and I will be their God,  and they shall be my people.
037:028 The nations shall know that I am Yahweh who sanctifies Israel,  when my sanctuary shall be in the midst of them forevermore.
037:029 Because of your raging against me, and because your arrogance  has come up into my ears, therefore will I put my hook  in your nose and my bridle in your lips, and I will turn you  back by the way by which you came.
037:030 This shall be the sign to you.  You will eat this year that  which grows of itself, and in the second year that which  springs from the same; and in the third year sow and reap  and plant vineyards, and eat their fruit.
037:031 The remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah will again  take root downward, and bear fruit upward.
037:032 For out of Jerusalem a remnant will go forth, and survivors  will escape from Mount Zion.  The zeal of Yahweh of Armies  will perform this.'
037:033 Therefore thus says Yahweh concerning the king of Assyria, 'He will  not come to this city, nor shoot an arrow there, neither will  he come before it with shield, nor cast up a mound against it.
037:034 By the way that he came, by the same he shall return,  and he shall not come to this city,' says Yahweh.
037:035 'For I will defend this city to save it, for my own sake,  and for my servant David's sake.'"
037:036 The angel of Yahweh went out and struck one hundred and  eighty-five thousand men in the camp of the Assyrians.  When men arose early in the morning, behold, these were  all dead bodies.
038:001 The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
038:002 Son of man, set your face toward Gog, of the land of Magog,  the prince of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal, and prophesy against him,
038:003 and say, Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Behold, I am against you,  Gog, prince of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal:
038:004 and I will turn you about, and put hooks into your jaws, and I  will bring you forth, and all your army, horses and horsemen,  all of them clothed in full armor, a great company with buckler  and shield, all of them handling swords;
038:005 Persia, Cush, and Put with them, all of them with shield and helmet;
038:006 Gomer, and all his hordes; the house of Togarmah in  the uttermost parts of the north, and all his hordes;  even many peoples with you.
038:007 Be prepared, yes, prepare yourself, you, and all your companies  who are assembled to you, and be a guard to them.
038:008 After many days you shall be visited:  in the latter years you  shall come into the land that is brought back from the sword,  that is gathered out of many peoples, on the mountains of Israel,  which have been a continual waste; but it is brought  forth out of the peoples, and they shall dwell securely,  all of them.
038:009 You shall ascend, you shall come like a storm, you shall  be like a cloud to cover the land, you, and all your hordes,  and many peoples with you.
038:010 Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  It shall happen in that day,  that things shall come into your mind, and you shall devise  an evil device:
038:011 and you shall say, I will go up to the land of unwalled villages;  I will go to those who are at rest, who dwell securely,  all of them dwelling without walls, and having neither  bars nor gates;
038:012 to take the spoil and to take the prey; to turn your hand  against the waste places that are [now] inhabited,  and against the people who are gathered out of the nations,  who have gotten livestock and goods, who dwell in the middle  of the earth.
038:013 Sheba, and Dedan, and the merchants of Tarshish, with all  the young lions of it, shall tell you, Are you come to take  the spoil? have you assembled your company to take the prey?  to carry away silver and gold, to take away livestock and goods,  to take great spoil?
038:014 Therefore, son of man, prophesy, and tell Gog, Thus says the  Lord Yahweh:  In that day when my people Israel dwells securely,  shall you not know it?
038:015 You shall come from your place out of the uttermost parts  of the north, you, and many peoples with you, all of them  riding on horses, a great company and a mighty army;
038:016 and you shall come up against my people Israel, as a cloud  to cover the land:  it shall happen in the latter days, that I  will bring you against my land, that the nations may know me,  when I shall be sanctified in you, Gog, before their eyes.
038:017 Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Are you he of whom I spoke in old  time by my servants the prophets of Israel, who prophesied in  those days for [many] years that I would bring you against them?
038:018 It shall happen in that day, when Gog shall come against the land  of Israel, says the Lord Yahweh, that my wrath shall come up  into my nostrils.
038:019 For in my jealousy and in the fire of my wrath have I spoken,  Surely in that day there shall be a great shaking in the  land of Israel;
038:020 so that the fish of the sea, and the birds of the sky,  and the animals of the field, and all creeping things who  creep on the earth, and all the men who are on the surface  of the earth, shall shake at my presence, and the mountains  shall be thrown down, and the steep places shall fall,  and every wall shall fall to the ground.
038:021 I will call for a sword against him to all my mountains,  says the Lord Yahweh:  every man's sword shall be  against his brother.
038:022 With pestilence and with blood will I enter into judgment  with him; and I will rain on him, and on his hordes, and on  the many peoples who are with him, an overflowing shower,  and great hailstones, fire, and sulfur.
038:023 I will magnify myself, and sanctify myself, and I will make  myself known in the eyes of many nations; and they shall know  that I am Yahweh.
038:024 Then said Zedekiah to Jeremiah, Let no man know of these words,  and you shall not die.
038:025 But if the princes hear that I have talked with you, and they  come to you, and tell you, Declare to us now what you have said  to the king; don't hide it from us, and we will not put you  to death; also what the king said to you:
038:026 then you shall tell them, I presented my supplication before the king,  that he would not cause me to return to Jonathan's house,  to die there.
038:027 Then came all the princes to Jeremiah, and asked him;  and he told them according to all these words that the king  had commanded.  So they left off speaking with him;  for the matter was not perceived.
038:028 So Jeremiah abode in the court of the guard until the day  that Jerusalem was taken.
038:029 Out of whose womb came the ice?  The gray frost of the sky,  who has given birth to it?
038:030 The waters become hard like stone, when the surface of the  deep is frozen.
039:001 You, son of man, prophesy against Gog, and say, Thus says  the Lord Yahweh:  Behold, I am against you, Gog, prince  of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal:
039:002 and I will turn you about, and will lead you on, and will  cause you to come up from the uttermost parts of the north;  and I will bring you on the mountains of Israel;
039:003 and I will strike your bow out of your left hand, and will cause  your arrows to fall out of your right hand.
039:004 You shall fall on the mountains of Israel, you, and all  your hordes, and the peoples who are with you:  I will give you to the ravenous birds of every sort,  and to the animals of the field to be devoured.
039:005 You shall fall on the open field; for I have spoken it,  says the Lord Yahweh.
039:006 I will send a fire on Magog, and on those who dwell securely  in the islands; and they shall know that I am Yahweh.
039:007 My holy name will I make known in the midst of my people Israel;  neither will I allow my holy name to be profaned any more:  and the nations shall know that I am Yahweh, the Holy One in Israel.
039:008 Behold, it comes, and it shall be done, says the Lord Yahweh;  this is the day about which I have spoken.
039:009 Those who dwell in the cities of Israel shall go forth,  and shall make fires of the weapons and burn them,  both the shields and the bucklers, the bows and the arrows,  and the war clubs, and the spears, and they shall make fires  of them seven years;
039:010 so that they shall take no wood out of the field, neither cut  down any out of the forests; for they shall make fires of  the weapons; and they shall plunder those who plundered them,  and rob those who robbed them, says the Lord Yahweh.
039:011 It shall happen in that day, that I will give to Gog a place  for burial in Israel, the valley of those who pass through on  the east of the sea; and it shall stop those who pass through:  and there shall they bury Gog and all his multitude;  and they shall call it The valley of Hamon Gog.
039:012 Seven months shall the house of Israel be burying them,  that they may cleanse the land.
039:013 Yes, all the people of the land shall bury them; and it shall  be to them a renown in the day that I shall be glorified,  says the Lord Yahweh.
039:014 They shall set apart men of continual employment, who shall pass  through the land, and, with those who pass through, those who bury  those who remain on the surface of the land, to cleanse it:  after the end of seven months shall they search.
039:015 Those who pass through the land shall pass through;  and when any sees a man's bone, then shall he set up a sign  by it, until the undertakers have buried it in the valley  of Hamon Gog.
039:016 Hamonah shall also be the name of a city.  Thus shall they  cleanse the land.
039:017 You, son of man, thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Speak to  the birds of every sort, and to every animal of the field,  Assemble yourselves, and come; gather yourselves on every side  to my sacrifice that I do sacrifice for you, even a great  sacrifice on the mountains of Israel, that you may eat flesh  and drink blood.
039:018 You shall eat the flesh of the mighty, and drink the blood  of the princes of the earth, of rams, of lambs, and of goats,  of bulls, all of them fatlings of Bashan.
039:019 You shall eat fat until you be full, and drink blood until you  be drunken, of my sacrifice which I have sacrificed for you.
039:020 You shall be filled at my table with horses and chariots,  with mighty men, and with all men of war, says the Lord Yahweh.
039:021 I will set my glory among the nations; and all the nations  shall see my judgment that I have executed, and my hand that I  have laid on them.
039:022 So the house of Israel shall know that I am Yahweh their God,  from that day and forward.
039:023 The nations shall know that the house of Israel went into  captivity for their iniquity; because they trespassed against me,  and I hid my face from them:  so I gave them into the hand  of their adversaries, and they fell all of them by the sword.
040:001 In the five and twentieth year of our captivity, in the beginning  of the year, in the tenth [day] of the month, in the fourteenth  year after that the city was struck, in the same day,  the hand of Yahweh was on me, and he brought me there.
040:002 In the visions of God brought he me into the land of Israel,  and set me down on a very high mountain, whereon was as it  were the frame of a city on the south.
040:003 He brought me there; and, behold, there was a man,  whose appearance was like the appearance of brass,  with a line of flax in his hand, and a measuring reed;  and he stood in the gate.
040:004 The man said to me, Son of man, see with your eyes, and hear  with your ears, and set your heart on all that I shall  show you; for, to the intent that I may show them to you,  are you brought here:  declare all that you see to the  house of Israel.
040:005 Behold, a wall on the outside of the house round about,  and in the man's hand a measuring reed six cubits long,  of a cubit and a handbreadth each:  so he measured the thickness  of the building, one reed; and the height, one reed.
040:006 Then came he to the gate which looks toward the east, and went  up the steps of it:  and he measured the threshold of the gate,  one reed broad; and the other threshold, one reed broad.
040:007 Every lodge was one reed long, and one reed broad;  and [the space] between the lodges was five cubits;  and the threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate toward  the house was one reed.
040:008 He measured also the porch of the gate toward the house, one reed.
040:009 Then measured he the porch of the gate, eight cubits;  and the posts of it, two cubits; and the porch of the gate  was toward the house.
040:010 The lodges of the gate eastward were three on this side,  and three on that side; they three were of one measure:  and the posts had one measure on this side and on that side.
040:011 He measured the breadth of the opening of the gate, ten cubits;  and the length of the gate, thirteen cubits;
040:012 and a border before the lodges, one cubit [on this side],  and a border, one cubit on that side; and the lodges,  six cubits on this side, and six cubits on that side.
040:013 He measured the gate from the roof of the one lodge to  the roof of the other, a breadth of twenty-five cubits;  door against door.
040:014 He made also posts, sixty cubits; and the court [reached]  to the posts, round about the gate.
040:015 [From] the forefront of the gate at the entrance to the forefront  of the inner porch of the gate were fifty cubits.
040:016 There were closed windows to the lodges, and to their posts  within the gate round about, and likewise to the arches;  and windows were round about inward; and on [each] post  were palm trees.
040:017 Then brought he me into the outer court; and behold, there were  chambers and a pavement, made for the court round about:  thirty chambers were on the pavement.
040:018 The pavement was by the side of the gates, answerable to  the length of the gates, even the lower pavement.
040:019 Then he measured the breadth from the forefront of the lower gate  to the forefront of the inner court outside, one hundred cubits,  [both] on the east and on the north.
040:020 The gate of the outer court whose prospect is toward the north,  he measured the length of it and the breadth of it.
040:021 The lodges of it were three on this side and three on that side;  and the posts of it and the arches of it were after the measure  of the first gate:  the length of it was fifty cubits,  and the breadth twenty-five cubits.
040:022 The windows of it, and the arches of it, and the palm trees  of it, were after the measure of the gate whose prospect  is toward the east; and they went up to it by seven steps;  and the arches of it were before them.
040:023 There was a gate to the inner court over against the [other] gate,  [both] on the north and on the east; and he measured from gate  to gate one hundred cubits.
041:001 He brought me to the temple, and measured the posts, six cubits  broad on the one side, and six cubits broad on the other side,  which was the breadth of the tent.
041:002 The breadth of the entrance was ten cubits; and the sides  of the entrance were five cubits on the one side, and five  cubits on the other side:  and he measured the length of it,  forty cubits, and the breadth, twenty cubits.
041:003 Then went he inward, and measured each post of the entrance,  two cubits; and the entrance, six cubits; and the breadth  of the entrance, seven cubits.
041:004 He measured the length of it, twenty cubits, and the breadth,  twenty cubits, before the temple:  and he said to me,  This is the most holy place.
041:005 Then he measured the wall of the house, six cubits;  and the breadth of every side chamber, four cubits,  round about the house on every side.
041:006 The side chambers were in three stories, one over another,  and thirty in order; and they entered into the wall which  belonged to the house for the side chambers round about,  that they might have hold [therein], and not have hold  in the wall of the house.
041:007 The side chambers were broader as they encompassed [the  house] higher and higher; for the encompassing of  the house went higher and higher round about the house:  therefore the breadth of the house [continued] upward;  and so one went up [from] the lowest [chamber] to the highest  by the middle [chamber].
041:008 I saw also that the house had a raised base round about:  the foundations of the side chambers were a full reed  of six great cubits.
041:009 The thickness of the wall, which was for the side chambers,  on the outside, was five cubits:  and that which was left was  the place of the side chambers that belonged to the house.
041:010 Between the chambers was a breadth of twenty cubits round  about the house on every side.
041:011 The doors of the side chambers were toward [the place] that was left,  one door toward the north, and another door toward the south:  and the breadth of the place that was left was five  cubits round about.
041:012 The building that was before the separate place at the side  toward the west was seventy cubits broad; and the wall of  the building was five cubits thick round about, and the length  of it ninety cubits.
041:013 So he measured the house, one hundred cubits long;  and the separate place, and the building, with the walls of it,  one hundred cubits long;
041:014 also the breadth of the face of the house, and of the separate  place toward the east, one hundred cubits.
041:015 He measured the length of the building before the separate  place which was at the back of it, and the galleries of it  on the one side and on the other side, one hundred cubits;  and the inner temple, and the porches of the court;
041:016 the thresholds, and the closed windows, and the galleries round  about on their three stories, over against the threshold, with wood  ceilings round about, and [from] the ground up to the windows,  (now the windows were covered),
041:017 to [the space] above the door, even to the inner house, and outside,  and by all the wall round about inside and outside, by measure.
041:018 It was made with cherubim and palm trees; and a palm tree was  between cherub and cherub, and every cherub had two faces;
041:019 so that there was the face of a man toward the palm tree on  the one side, and the face of a young lion toward the palm  tree on the other side.  [thus was it] made through all  the house round about:
041:020 from the ground to above the door were cherubim and palm trees made:  thus was the wall of the temple.
041:021 As for the temple, the door posts were squared; and as for the face  of the sanctuary, the appearance [of it] was as the appearance  [of the temple].
041:022 The altar was of wood, three cubits high, and the length of it  two cubits; and the corners of it, and the length of it,  and the walls of it, were of wood:  and he said to me,  This is the table that is before Yahweh.
041:023 The temple and the sanctuary had two doors.
041:024 The doors had two leaves [apiece], two turning leaves:  two [leaves] for the one door, and two leaves for the other.
041:025 There were made on them, on the doors of the temple,  cherubim and palm trees, like as were made on the walls;  and there was a threshold of wood on the face of the porch outside.
041:026 There were closed windows and palm trees on the one side  and on the other side, on the sides of the porch:  thus were the side chambers of the house, and the thresholds.
041:027 I am the first to say to Zion, 'Behold, look at them;'  and I will give one who brings good news to Jerusalem.
041:028 When I look, there is no man; even among them there is no  counselor who, when I ask of them, can answer a word.
041:029 Behold, all of them, their works are vanity and nothing.  Their molten images are wind and confusion.
041:030 His undersides are like sharp potsherds, leaving a trail  in the mud like a threshing sledge.
041:031 He makes the deep to boil like a pot.  He makes the sea  like a pot of ointment.
041:032 He makes a path shine after him.  One would think the deep  had white hair.
041:033 On earth there is not his equal, that is made without fear.
041:034 He sees everything that is high.  He is king over all  the sons of pride."
041:035 Let them gather all the food of these good years that come,  and lay up grain under the hand of Pharaoh for food in the cities,  and let them keep it.
041:036 The food will be for a store to the land against the seven  years of famine, which will be in the land of Egypt;  that the land not perish through the famine."
041:037 The thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes  of all his servants.
041:038 Pharaoh said to his servants, "Can we find such a one as this,  a man in whom is the Spirit of God?"
041:039 Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Because God has shown you all of this,  there is none so discreet and wise as you.
041:040 You shall be over my house, and according to your word  will all my people be ruled.  Only in the throne I will be  greater than you."
041:041 Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Behold, I have set you over all  the land of Egypt."
041:042 Pharaoh took off his signet ring from his hand, and put it  on Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in robes of fine linen,  and put a gold chain about his neck,
041:043 and he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had.  They cried before him, "Bow the knee!"  He set him over all  the land of Egypt.
041:044 Pharaoh said to Joseph, "I am Pharaoh, and without you shall  no man lift up his hand or his foot in all the land of Egypt."
041:045 Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphenath-Paneah; and he gave  him Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera priest of On as a wife.  Joseph went out over the land of Egypt.
041:046 Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king  of Egypt.  Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh,  and went throughout all the land of Egypt.
041:047 In the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth abundantly.
041:048 He gathered up all the food of the seven years which were  in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities:  the food of the field, which was round about every city,  he laid up in the same.
041:049 Joseph laid up grain as the sand of the sea, very much,  until he stopped counting, for it was without number.
041:050 To Joseph were born two sons before the year of famine came,  whom Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera priest of On,  bore to him.
041:051 Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh,{"Manasseh"  sounds like the Hebrew for "forget."} "For," he said, "God has  made me forget all my toil, and all my father's house."
041:052 The name of the second, he called Ephraim{"Ephraim"  sounds like the Hebrew for "twice fruitful."}: "For God has  made me fruitful in the land of my affliction."
041:053 The seven years of plenty, that were in the land of Egypt,  came to an end.
041:054 The seven years of famine began to come, just as Joseph had said.  There was famine in all lands, but in all the land of Egypt  there was bread.
041:055 When all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh  for bread, and Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, "Go to Joseph.  What he says to you, do."
041:056 The famine was over all the surface of the earth.  Joseph opened all the store houses, and sold to the Egyptians.  The famine was severe in the land of Egypt.
041:057 All countries came into Egypt, to Joseph, to buy grain,  because the famine was severe in all the earth.
042:001 Then he brought me forth into the outer court, the way toward  the north:  and he brought me into the chamber that was  over against the separate place, and which was over against  the building toward the north.
042:002 Before the length of one hundred cubits was the north door,  and the breadth was fifty cubits.
042:003 Over against the twenty [cubits] which belonged to the inner court,  and over against the pavement which belonged to the outer court,  was gallery against gallery in the third story.
042:004 Before the chambers was a walk of ten cubits' breadth inward,  a way of one cubit; and their doors were toward the north.
042:005 Now the upper chambers were shorter; for the galleries took  away from these, more than from the lower and the middle,  in the building.
042:006 For they were in three stories, and they didn't have pillars  as the pillars of the courts:  therefore [the uppermost] was  straitened more than the lowest and the middle from the ground.
042:007 The wall that was outside by the side of the chambers,  toward the outer court before the chambers, the length of it  was fifty cubits.
042:008 For the length of the chambers that were in the outer court  was fifty cubits:  and behold, before the temple were  one hundred cubits.
042:009 From under these chambers was the entry on the east side,  as one goes into them from the outer court.
042:010 In the thickness of the wall of the court toward the east,  before the separate place, and before the building,  there were chambers.
042:011 The way before them was like the appearance of [the way of]  the chambers which were toward the north; according to their  length so was their breadth:  and all their exits were both  according to their fashions, and according to their doors.
042:012 According to the doors of the chambers that were toward the south  was a door at the head of the way, even the way directly  before the wall toward the east, as one enters into them.
042:013 Then said he to me, The north chambers and the south chambers,  which are before the separate place, they are the holy chambers,  where the priests who are near to Yahweh shall eat the most  holy things:  there shall they lay the most holy things, and the  meal offering, and the sin offering, and the trespass offering;  for the place is holy.
042:014 When the priests enter in, then shall they not go out of  the holy place into the outer court, but there they shall lay  their garments in which they minister; for they are holy:  and they shall put on other garments, and shall approach  to that which pertains to the people.
042:015 Now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house,  he brought me forth by the way of the gate whose prospect  is toward the east, and measured it round about.
042:016 He measured on the east side with the measuring reed five  hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about.
042:017 He measured on the north side five hundred reeds with the measuring  reed round about.
042:018 He measured on the south side five hundred reeds with  the measuring reed.
042:019 He turned about to the west side, and measured five hundred  reeds with the measuring reed.
042:020 He measured it on the four sides:  it had a wall round about,  the length five hundred, and the breadth five hundred,  to make a separation between that which was holy and that  which was common.
042:021 and I have this day declared it to you; but you have not obeyed  the voice of Yahweh your God in anything for which he has  sent me to you.
042:022 Now therefore know certainly that you shall die by the sword,  by the famine, and by the pestilence, in the place where you  desire to go to sojourn there.
042:023 Who is there among you who will give ear to this?  Who will listen and hear for the time to come?
042:024 Who gave Jacob as plunder, and Israel to the robbers?  Didn't Yahweh, he against whom we have sinned?  For they  would not walk in his ways, and they disobeyed his law.
042:025 Therefore he poured the fierceness of his anger on him,  and the strength of battle; and it set him on fire all around,  but he didn't know; and it burned him, but he didn't take  it to heart."
042:026 They loaded their donkeys with their grain, and departed from there.
042:027 As one of them opened his sack to give his donkey food in the  lodging place, he saw his money.  Behold, it was in the mouth  of his sack.
042:028 He said to his brothers, "My money is restored!  Behold, it is  in my sack!"  Their hearts failed them, and they turned  trembling one to another, saying, "What is this that God has  done to us?"
042:029 They came to Jacob their father, to the land of Canaan,  and told him all that had happened to them, saying,
042:030 "The man, the lord of the land, spoke roughly with us,  and took us for spies of the country.
042:031 We said to him, 'We are honest men.  We are no spies.
042:032 We are twelve brothers, sons of our father; one is no more,  and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan.'
042:033 The man, the lord of the land, said to us, 'By this I will know  that you are honest men:  leave one of your brothers with me,  and take grain for the famine of your houses, and go your way.
042:034 Bring your youngest brother to me.  Then I will know  that you are not spies, but that you are honest men.  So I will deliver your brother to you, and you shall trade  in the land.'"
042:035 It happened as they emptied their sacks, that behold, every man's  bundle of money was in his sack.  When they and their father  saw their bundles of money, they were afraid.
042:036 Jacob, their father, said to them, "You have bereaved me  of my children!  Joseph is no more, Simeon is no more,  and you want to take Benjamin away.  All these things  are against me."
042:037 Reuben spoke to his father, saying, "Kill my two sons,  if I don't bring him to you.  Entrust him to my care,  and I will bring him to you again."
042:038 He said, "My son shall not go down with you; for his brother  is dead, and he only is left.  If harm happens to him along  the way in which you go, then you will bring down my gray  hairs with sorrow to Sheol."
043:001 Afterward he brought me to the gate, even the gate that looks  toward the east.
043:002 Behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way  of the east:  and his voice was like the sound of many waters;  and the earth shined with his glory.
043:003 It was according to the appearance of the vision which I saw,  even according to the vision that I saw when I came to destroy  the city; and the visions were like the vision that I saw  by the river Chebar; and I fell on my face.
043:004 The glory of Yahweh came into the house by the way of the gate  whose prospect is toward the east.
043:005 The Spirit took me up, and brought me into the inner court;  and behold, the glory of Yahweh filled the house.
043:006 I heard one speaking to me out of the house; and a man  stood by me.
043:007 He said to me, Son of man, [this is] the place of my throne,  and the place of the soles of my feet, where I will  dwell in the midst of the children of Israel forever.  The house of Israel shall no more defile my holy name,  neither they, nor their kings, by their prostitution,  and by the dead bodies of their kings [in] their high places;
043:008 in their setting of their threshold by my threshold,  and their doorpost beside my doorpost, and there was [but]  the wall between me and them; and they have defiled my holy  name by their abominations which they have committed:  therefore I have consumed them in my anger.
043:009 Now let them put away their prostitution, and the dead bodies  of their kings, far from me; and I will dwell in the midst  of them forever.
043:010 You, son of man, show the house to the house of Israel,  that they may be ashamed of their iniquities; and let them  measure the pattern.
043:011 If they be ashamed of all that they have done, make known to them  the form of the house, and the fashion of it, and the exits  of it, and the entrances of it, and all the forms of it,  and all the ordinances of it, and all the forms of it,  and all the laws of it; and write it in their sight; that they  may keep the whole form of it, and all the ordinances of it,  and do them.
043:012 This is the law of the house:  on the top of the mountain  the whole limit of it round about shall be most holy.  Behold, this is the law of the house.
043:013 These are the measures of the altar by cubits (the cubit  is a cubit and a handbreadth):  the bottom shall be a cubit,  and the breadth a cubit, and the border of it by the edge of it  round about a span; and this shall be the base of the altar.
043:014 From the bottom on the ground to the lower ledge shall  be two cubits, and the breadth one cubit; and from  the lesser ledge to the greater ledge shall be four cubits,  and the breadth a cubit.
043:015 The upper altar shall be four cubits; and from the altar hearth  and upward there shall be four horns.
043:016 The altar hearth shall be twelve [cubits] long by twelve broad,  square in the four sides of it.
043:017 The ledge shall be fourteen [cubits] long by fourteen broad  in the four sides of it; and the border about it shall be half  a cubit; and the bottom of it shall be a cubit round about;  and the steps of it shall look toward the east.
043:018 He said to me, Son of man, thus says the Lord Yahweh:  These are  the ordinances of the altar in the day when they shall make it,  to offer burnt offerings thereon, and to sprinkle blood thereon.
043:019 You shall give to the priests the Levites who are of  the seed of Zadok, who are near to me, to minister to me,  says the Lord Yahweh, a young bull for a sin offering.
043:020 You shall take of the blood of it, and put it on the four horns of it,  and on the four corners of the ledge, and on the border round about:  thus shall you cleanse it and make atonement for it.
043:021 You shall also take the bull of the sin offering,  and it shall be burnt in the appointed place of the house,  outside of the sanctuary.
043:022 On the second day you shall offer a male goat without blemish  for a sin offering; and they shall cleanse the altar,  as they did cleanse it with the bull.
043:023 When you have made an end of cleansing it, you shall offer a young  bull without blemish, and a ram out of the flock without blemish.
043:024 You shall bring them near before Yahweh, and the priests shall  cast salt on them, and they shall offer them up for a burnt  offering to Yahweh.
043:025 Seven days shall you prepare every day a goat for a sin offering:  they shall also prepare a young bull, and a ram out of  the flock, without blemish.
043:026 Seven days shall they make atonement for the altar and purify it;  so shall they consecrate it.
043:027 When they have accomplished the days, it shall be that on  the eighth day, and forward, the priests shall make your  burnt offerings on the altar, and your peace offerings;  and I will accept you, says the Lord Yahweh.
043:028 Therefore I will profane the princes of the sanctuary;  and I will make Jacob a curse, and Israel a reviling."
043:029 He lifted up his eyes, and saw Benjamin, his brother,  his mother's son, and said, "Is this your youngest brother,  of whom you spoke to me?"  He said, "God be gracious  to you, my son."
043:030 Joseph hurried, for his heart yearned over his brother;  and he sought a place to weep.  He entered into his room,  and wept there.
043:031 He washed his face, and came out.  He controlled himself,  and said, "Serve the meal."
043:032 They served him by himself, and them by themselves,  and the Egyptians, that ate with him, by themselves,  because the Egyptians don't eat bread with the Hebrews,  for that is an abomination to the Egyptians.
043:033 They sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright,  and the youngest according to his youth, and the men marveled  one with another.
043:034 He sent portions to them from before him, but Benjamin's  portion was five times as much as any of theirs.  They drank, and were merry with him.
044:001 Then he brought me back by the way of the outer gate of the sanctuary,  which looks toward the east; and it was shut.
044:002 Yahweh said to me, This gate shall be shut; it shall not be opened,  neither shall any man enter in by it; for Yahweh, the God  of Israel, has entered in by it; therefore it shall be shut.
044:003 As for the prince, he shall sit therein as prince to eat bread  before Yahweh; he shall enter by the way of the porch of the gate,  and shall go out by the way of the same.
044:004 Then he brought me by the way of the north gate before the house;  and I looked, and behold, the glory of Yahweh filled the house  of Yahweh:  and I fell on my face.
044:005 Yahweh said to me, Son of man, mark well, and see with your eyes,  and hear with your ears all that I tell you concerning all  the ordinances of the house of Yahweh, and all the laws of it;  and mark well the entrance of the house, with every exit  of the sanctuary.
044:006 You shall tell the rebellious, even to the house of Israel, Thus says  the Lord Yahweh:  you house of Israel, let it suffice you  of all your abominations,
044:007 in that you have brought in foreigners, uncircumcised in  heart and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in my sanctuary,  to profane it, even my house, when you offer my bread,  the fat and the blood, and they have broken my covenant,  [to add] to all your abominations.
044:008 You have not kept the charge of my holy things; but you have  set keepers of my charge in my sanctuary for yourselves.
044:009 Thus says the Lord Yahweh, No foreigner, uncircumcised in heart  and uncircumcised in flesh, shall enter into my sanctuary,  of any foreigners who are among the children of Israel.
044:010 But the Levites who went far from me, when Israel went astray,  who went astray from me after their idols, they shall  bear their iniquity.
044:011 Yet they shall be ministers in my sanctuary, having oversight  at the gates of the house, and ministering in the house:  they shall kill the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the people,  and they shall stand before them to minister to them.
044:012 Because they ministered to them before their idols,  and became a stumbling block of iniquity to the house  of Israel; therefore have I lifted up my hand against them,  says the Lord Yahweh, and they shall bear their iniquity.
044:013 They shall not come near to me, to execute the office  of priest to me, nor to come near to any of my holy things,  to the things that are most holy; but they shall bear their shame,  and their abominations which they have committed.
044:014 Yet will I make them keepers of the charge of the house, for all  the service of it, and for all that shall be done therein.
044:015 But the priests the Levites, the sons of Zadok, who kept  the charge of my sanctuary when the children of Israel went  astray from me, they shall come near to me to minister to me;  and they shall stand before me to offer to me the fat and  the blood, says the Lord Yahweh:
044:016 they shall enter into my sanctuary, and they shall come near  to my table, to minister to me, and they shall keep my charge.
044:017 It shall be that, when they enter in at the gates of the  inner court, they shall be clothed with linen garments;  and no wool shall come on them, while they minister in the gates  of the inner court, and within.
044:018 They shall have linen tires on their heads, and shall have linen  breeches on their waists; they shall not gird themselves  with [anything that causes] sweat.
044:019 When they go forth into the outer court, even into the outer  court to the people, they shall put off their garments  in which they minister, and lay them in the holy chambers;  and they shall put on other garments, that they not sanctify  the people with their garments.
044:020 Neither shall they shave their heads, nor allow their locks  to grow long; they shall only cut off the hair of their heads.
044:021 Neither shall any of the priests drink wine, when they enter  into the inner court.
044:022 Neither shall they take for their wives a widow, nor her who is  put away; but they shall take virgins of the seed of the house  of Israel, or a widow who is the widow of a priest.
044:023 They shall teach my people the difference between the holy  and the common, and cause them to discern between the unclean  and the clean.
044:024 In a controversy they shall stand to judge; according to my  ordinances shall they judge it:  and they shall keep my laws  and my statutes in all my appointed feasts; and they shall  make my Sabbaths holy.
044:025 They shall go in to no dead person to defile themselves;  but for father, or for mother, or for son, or for daughter,  for brother, or for sister who has had no husband,  they may defile themselves.
044:026 After he is cleansed, they shall reckon to him seven days.
044:027 In the day that he goes into the sanctuary, into the inner court,  to minister in the sanctuary, he shall offer his sin offering,  says the Lord Yahweh.
044:028 They shall have an inheritance:  I am their inheritance; and you  shall give them no possession in Israel; I am their possession.
044:029 They shall eat the meal offering, and the sin offering,  and the trespass offering; and every devoted thing in Israel  shall be theirs.
044:030 The first of all the first fruits of every thing, and every offering  of everything, of all your offerings, shall be for the priest:  you shall also give to the priests the first of your dough,  to cause a blessing to rest on your house.
044:031 The priests shall not eat of anything that dies of itself,  or is torn, whether it be bird or animal.
044:032 For your servant became collateral for the boy to my father,  saying, 'If I don't bring him to you, then I will bear  the blame to my father forever.'
044:033 Now therefore, please let your servant stay instead of the boy,  a bondservant to my lord; and let the boy go up with his brothers.
044:034 For how will I go up to my father, if the boy isn't with me?--  lest I see the evil that will come on my father."
045:001 Moreover, when you shall divide by lot the land for inheritance,  you shall offer an offering to Yahweh, a holy portion  of the land; the length shall be the length of twenty-five  thousand [reeds], and the breadth shall be ten thousand:  it shall be holy in all the border of it round about.
045:002 Of this there shall be for the holy place five hundred [in  length] by five hundred [in breadth], square round about;  and fifty cubits for the suburbs of it round about.
045:003 Of this measure shall you measure a length of twenty-five thousand,  and a breadth of ten thousand:  and in it shall be the sanctuary,  which is most holy.
045:004 It is a holy portion of the land; it shall be for the priests,  the ministers of the sanctuary, who come near to minister to Yahweh;  and it shall be a place for their houses, and a holy place  for the sanctuary.
045:005 Twenty-five thousand in length, and ten thousand in breadth,  shall be to the Levites, the ministers of the house,  for a possession to themselves, [for] twenty chambers.
045:006 You shall appoint the possession of the city five thousand broad,  and twenty-five thousand long, side by side with the offering  of the holy portion:  it shall be for the whole house of Israel.
045:007 [Whatever is] for the prince [shall be] on the one side and on  the other side of the holy offering and of the possession  of the city, in front of the holy offering and in front  of the possession of the city, on the west side westward,  and on the east side eastward; and in length answerable to one  of the portions, from the west border to the east border.
045:008 In the land it shall be to him for a possession in Israel:  and my princes shall no more oppress my people; but they shall  give the land to the house of Israel according to their tribes.
045:009 Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Let it suffice you, princes of Israel:  remove violence and spoil, and execute justice and righteousness;  dispossessing my people, says the Lord Yahweh.
045:010 You shall have just balances, and a just ephah, and a just bath.
045:011 The ephah and the bath shall be of one measure, that the bath  may contain the tenth part of a homer, and the ephah the tenth  part of a homer:  the measure of it shall be after the homer.
045:012 The shekel shall be twenty gerahs.  Twenty shekels plus  twenty-five shekels plus fifteen shekels shall be your mina.
045:013 This is the offering that you shall offer:  the sixth part  of an ephah from a homer of wheat; and you shall give the sixth  part of an ephah from a homer of barley;
045:014 and the set portion of oil, of the bath of oil, the tenth part  of a bath out of the cor, [which is] ten baths, even a homer;  (for ten baths are a homer;)
045:015 and one lamb of the flock, out of two hundred, from the well-watered  pastures of Israel--for a meal offering, and for a burnt offering,  and for peace offerings, to make atonement for them,  says the Lord Yahweh.
045:016 All the people of the land shall give to this offering for  the prince in Israel.
045:017 It shall be the prince's part to give the burnt offerings,  and the meal offerings, and the drink offerings,  in the feasts, and on the new moons, and on the Sabbaths,  in all the appointed feasts of the house of Israel:  he shall prepare the sin offering, and the meal offering,  and the burnt offering, and the peace offerings, to make  atonement for the house of Israel.
045:018 Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  In the first [month], in the first  [day] of the month, you shall take a young bull without blemish;  and you shall cleanse the sanctuary.
045:019 The priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering,  and put it on the door posts of the house, and on the four  corners of the ledge of the altar, and on the posts of the gate  of the inner court.
045:020 So you shall do on the seventh [day] of the month for everyone  who errs, and for him who is simple:  so shall you make  atonement for the house.
045:021 In the first [month], in the fourteenth day of the month,  you shall have the Passover, a feast of seven days;  unleavened bread shall be eaten.
045:022 On that day shall the prince prepare for himself and for all  the people of the land a bull for a sin offering.
045:023 The seven days of the feast he shall prepare a burnt offering  to Yahweh, seven bulls and seven rams without blemish daily  the seven days; and a male goat daily for a sin offering.
045:024 He shall prepare a meal offering, an ephah for a bull,  and an ephah for a ram, and a hin of oil to an ephah.
045:025 In the seventh [month], in the fifteenth day of the month,  in the feast, shall he do the like the seven days;  according to the sin offering, according to the burnt offering,  and according to the meal offering, and according to the oil.
045:026 They told him, saying, "Joseph is still alive, and he is  ruler over all the land of Egypt."  His heart fainted,  for he didn't believe them.
045:027 They told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said to them.  When he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him,  the spirit of Jacob, their father, revived.
045:028 Israel said, "It is enough.  Joseph my son is still alive.  I will go and see him before I die."
046:001 Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  The gate of the inner court that  looks toward the east shall be shut the six working days;  but on the Sabbath day it shall be opened, and on the day  of the new moon it shall be opened.
046:002 The prince shall enter by the way of the porch of the gate outside,  and shall stand by the post of the gate; and the priests  shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings,  and he shall worship at the threshold of the gate:  then he shall go forth; but the gate shall not be shut  until the evening.
046:003 The people of the land shall worship at the door of that gate  before Yahweh on the Sabbaths and on the new moons.
046:004 The burnt offering that the prince shall offer to Yahweh  shall be on the Sabbath day six lambs without blemish and a  ram without blemish;
046:005 and the meal offering shall be an ephah for the ram,  and the meal offering for the lambs as he is able to give,  and a hin of oil to an ephah.
046:006 On the day of the new moon it shall be a young bull without blemish,  and six lambs, and a ram; they shall be without blemish:
046:007 and he shall prepare a meal offering, an ephah for the bull,  and an ephah for the ram, and for the lambs according  as he is able, and a hin of oil to an ephah.
046:008 When the prince shall enter, he shall go in by the way of the porch  of the gate, and he shall go forth by the way of it.
046:009 But when the people of the land shall come before Yahweh  in the appointed feasts, he who enters by the way of the north  gate to worship shall go forth by the way of the south gate;  and he who enters by the way of the south gate shall go  forth by the way of the north gate:  he shall not return  by the way of the gate by which he came in, but shall go  forth straight before him.
046:010 The prince, when they go in, shall go in with of them;  and when they go out, he shall go out.
046:011 In the feasts and in the solemnities the meal offering  shall be an ephah for a bull, and an ephah for a ram,  and for the lambs as he is able to give, and a hin of oil  to an ephah.
046:012 When the prince shall prepare a freewill offering, a burnt  offering or peace offerings as a freewill offering to Yahweh,  one shall open for him the gate that looks toward the east;  and he shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings,  as he does on the Sabbath day:  then he shall go forth;  and after his going forth one shall shut the gate.
046:013 You shall prepare a lamb a year old without blemish for a  burnt offering to Yahweh daily:  morning by morning shall  you prepare it.
046:014 You shall prepare a meal offering with it morning by morning,  the sixth part of an ephah, and the third part of a hin of oil,  to moisten the fine flour; a meal offering to Yahweh continually  by a perpetual ordinance.
046:015 Thus shall they prepare the lamb, and the meal offering,  and the oil, morning by morning, for a continual burnt offering.
046:016 Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  If the prince give a gift to any  of his sons, it is his inheritance, it shall belong to his sons;  it is their possession by inheritance.
046:017 But if he give of his inheritance a gift to one of his servants,  it shall be his to the year of liberty; then it shall  return to the prince; but as for his inheritance, it shall  be for his sons.
046:018 Moreover the prince shall not take of the people's inheritance,  to thrust them out of their possession; he shall give  inheritance to his sons out of his own possession, that my  people not be scattered every man from his possession.
046:019 Then he brought me through the entry, which was at the side  of the gate, into the holy chambers for the priests,  which looked toward the north:  and behold, there was a place  on the hinder part westward.
046:020 He said to me, This is the place where the priests shall boil  the trespass offering and the sin offering, [and] where they  shall bake the meal offering; that they not bring them forth  into the outer court, to sanctify the people.
046:021 Then he brought me forth into the outer court, and caused  me to pass by the four corners of the court; and behold,  in every corner of the court there was a court.
046:022 In the four corners of the court there were courts enclosed,  forty [cubits] long and thirty broad:  these four in the corners  were of one measure.
046:023 There was a wall round about in them, round about the four,  and boiling places were made under the walls round about.
046:024 Then said he to me, These are the boiling houses, where the  ministers of the house shall boil the sacrifice of the people.
046:025 Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel, says:  Behold, I will  punish Amon of No, and Pharaoh, and Egypt, with her gods,  and her kings; even Pharaoh, and those who trust in him:
046:026 and I will deliver them into the hand of those who seek their lives,  and into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and into  the hand of his servants; and afterwards it shall be inhabited,  as in the days of old, says Yahweh.
046:027 But don't be afraid you, Jacob my servant, neither be  dismayed, Israel:  for, behold, I will save you from afar,  and your seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob  shall return, and shall be quiet and at ease, and none shall  make him afraid.
046:028 Don't be afraid you, O Jacob my servant, says Yahweh; for I  am with you:  for I will make a full end of all the nations  where I have driven you; but I will not make a full end of you,  but I will correct you in measure, and will in no way  leave you unpunished.
046:029 Joseph made ready his chariot, and went up to meet Israel,  his father, in Goshen.  He presented himself to him,  and fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while.
046:030 Israel said to Joseph, "Now let me die, since I have seen  your face, that you are still alive."
046:031 Joseph said to his brothers, and to his father's house,  "I will go up, and speak with Pharaoh, and will tell him,  'My brothers, and my father's house, who were in the land  of Canaan, have come to me.
046:032 These men are shepherds, for they have been keepers of livestock,  and they have brought their flocks, and their herds,  and all that they have.'
046:033 It will happen, when Pharaoh summons you, and will say,  'What is your occupation?'
046:034 that you shall say, 'Your servants have been keepers of livestock  from our youth even until now, both we, and our fathers:'  that you may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd  is an abomination to the Egyptians."
047:001 He brought me back to the door of the house; and behold,  waters issued out from under the threshold of the house eastward;  (for the forefront of the house was toward the east;)  and the waters came down from under, from the right side  of the house, on the south of the altar.
047:002 Then he brought me out by the way of the gate northward,  and led me round by the way outside to the outer gate,  by the way of [the gate] that looks toward the east;  and behold, there ran out waters on the right side.
047:003 When the man went forth eastward with the line in his hand,  he measured one thousand cubits, and he caused me to pass  through the waters, waters that were to the ankles.
047:004 Again he measured one thousand, and caused me to pass through  the waters, waters that were to the knees.  Again he measured  one thousand, and caused me to pass through [the waters],  waters that were to the waist.
047:005 Afterward he measured one thousand; [and it was] a river  that I could not pass through; for the waters were risen,  waters to swim in, a river that could not be passed through.
047:006 He said to me, Son of man, have you seen [this]?  Then he brought me, and caused me to return to the bank  of the river.
047:007 Now when I had returned, behold, on the bank of the river  were very many trees on the one side and on the other.
047:008 Then said he to me, These waters issue forth toward  the eastern region, and shall go down into the Arabah;  and they shall go toward the sea; into the sea [shall  the waters go] which were made to issue forth; and the waters  shall be healed.
047:009 It shall happen, that every living creature which swarms,  in every place where the rivers come, shall live; and there  shall be a very great multitude of fish; for these waters  are come there, and [the waters of the sea] shall be healed,  and everything shall live wherever the river comes.
047:010 It shall happen, that fishermen shall stand by it:  from En Gedi even to En Eglaim shall be a place for the  spreading of nets; their fish shall be after their kinds,  as the fish of the great sea, exceeding many.
047:011 But the miry places of it, and the marshes of it, shall not  be healed; they shall be given up to salt.
047:012 By the river on the bank of it, on this side and on that side,  shall grow every tree for food, whose leaf shall not wither,  neither shall the fruit of it fail:  it shall bring forth  new fruit every month, because the waters of it issue out  of the sanctuary; and the fruit of it shall be for food,  and the leaf of it for healing.
047:013 Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  This shall be the border, by which you  shall divide the land for inheritance according to the twelve  tribes of Israel:  Joseph [shall have two] portions.
047:014 You shall inherit it, one as well as another; for I swore  to give it to your fathers:  and this land shall fall  to you for inheritance.
047:015 This shall be the border of the land:  On the north side,  from the great sea, by the way of Hethlon, to the entrance of Zedad;
047:016 Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim, which is between the border  of Damascus and the border of Hamath; Hazer Hatticon,  which is by the border of Hauran.
047:017 The border from the sea, shall be Hazar Enon at the border  of Damascus; and on the north northward is the border of Hamath.  This is the north side.
047:018 The east side, between Hauran and Damascus and Gilead,  and the land of Israel, shall be the Jordan;  from the [north] border to the east sea shall you measure.  This is the east side.
047:019 The south side southward shall be from Tamar as far as the waters  of Meriboth Kadesh, to the brook [of Egypt], to the great sea.  This is the south side southward.
047:020 The west side shall be the great sea, from the [south]  border as far as over against the entrance of Hamath.  This is the west side.
047:021 So shall you divide this land to you according to the  tribes of Israel.
047:022 It shall happen, that you shall divide it by lot for an  inheritance to you and to the strangers who sojourn among you,  who shall father children among you; and they shall be to you  as the native-born among the children of Israel; they shall  have inheritance with you among the tribes of Israel.
047:023 It shall happen, that in what tribe the stranger sojourns,  there shall you give him his inheritance, says the Lord Yahweh.
047:024 It will happen at the harvests, that you shall give a fifth  to Pharaoh, and four parts will be your own, for seed  of the field, for your food, for them of your households,  and for food for your little ones."
047:025 They said, "You have saved our lives!  Let us find favor  in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh's servants."
047:026 Joseph made it a statute concerning the land of Egypt  to this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth.  Only the land of the priests alone didn't become Pharaoh's.
047:027 Israel lived in the land of Egypt, in the land of Goshen;  and they got themselves possessions therein, and were fruitful,  and multiplied exceedingly.
047:028 Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years.  So the days of Jacob, the years of his life, were one  hundred forty-seven years.
047:029 The time drew near that Israel must die, and he called his son Joseph,  and said to him, "If now I have found favor in your sight, please put  your hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me.  Please don't bury me in Egypt,
047:030 but when I sleep with my fathers, you shall carry me  out of Egypt, and bury me in their burying place."  He said, "I will do as you have said."
047:031 He said, "Swear to me," and he swore to him.  Israel bowed  himself on the bed's head.
048:001 Now these are the names of the tribes:  From the north end,  beside the way of Hethlon to the entrance of Hamath, Hazar Enan  at the border of Damascus, northward beside Hamath, (and they  shall have their sides east [and] west), Dan, one [portion].
048:002 By the border of Dan, from the east side to the west side,  Asher, one [portion].
048:003 By the border of Asher, from the east side even to the west side,  Naphtali, one [portion].
048:004 By the border of Naphtali, from the east side to the west side,  Manasseh, one [portion].
048:005 By the border of Manasseh, from the east side to the west side,  Ephraim, one [portion].
048:006 By the border of Ephraim, from the east side even to the  west side, Reuben, one [portion].
048:007 By the border of Reuben, from the east side to the west side,  Judah, one [portion].
048:008 By the border of Judah, from the east side to the west side,  shall be the offering which you shall offer, twenty-five thousand  [reeds] in breadth, and in length as one of the portions,  from the east side to the west side:  and the sanctuary shall  be in the midst of it.
048:009 The offering that you shall offer to Yahweh shall be twenty-five  thousand [reeds] in length, and ten thousand in breadth.
048:010 For these, even for the priests, shall be the holy offering:  toward the north twenty-five thousand [in length], and toward  the west ten thousand in breadth, and toward the east ten thousand  in breadth, and toward the south twenty-five thousand in length:  and the sanctuary of Yahweh shall be in the midst of it.
048:011 [It shall be] for the priests who are sanctified of the sons  of Zadok, who have kept my charge, who didn't go astray when  the children of Israel went astray, as the Levites went astray.
048:012 It shall be to them an offering from the offering of the land,  a thing most holy, by the border of the Levites.
048:013 Answerable to the border of the priests, the Levites shall have  twenty-five thousand in length, and ten thousand in breadth:  all the length shall be twenty-five thousand, and the  breadth ten thousand.
048:014 They shall sell none of it, nor exchange it, nor shall the first  fruits of the land be alienated; for it is holy to Yahweh.
048:015 The five thousand that are left in the breadth, in front  of the twenty-five thousand, shall be for common use,  for the city, for dwelling and for suburbs; and the city  shall be in the midst of it.
048:016 These shall be the measures of it:  the north side four thousand  and five hundred, and the south side four thousand and five hundred,  and on the east side four thousand and five hundred,  and the west side four thousand and five hundred.
048:017 The city shall have suburbs:  toward the north two hundred fifty,  and toward the south two hundred fifty, and toward the east  two hundred fifty, and toward the west two hundred fifty.
048:018 The remainder in the length, answerable to the holy offering,  shall be ten thousand eastward, and ten thousand westward;  and it shall be answerable to the holy offering; and the increase  of it shall be for food to those who labor in the city.
048:019 Those who labor in the city, out of all the tribes of Israel,  shall cultivate it.
048:020 All the offering shall be twenty-five thousand by  twenty-five thousand:  you shall offer the holy offering four-square,  with the possession of the city.
048:021 The residue shall be for the prince, on the one side and on  the other of the holy offering and of the possession of the city;  in front of the twenty-five thousand of the offering toward  the east border, and westward in front of the twenty-five  thousand toward the west border, answerable to the portions,  it shall be for the prince:  and the holy offering and  the sanctuary of the house shall be in the midst of it.
048:022 Moreover from the possession of the Levites, and from the possession  of the city, being in the midst of that which is the prince's,  between the border of Judah and the border of Benjamin,  it shall be for the prince.
049:001 Of the children of Ammon.  Thus says Yahweh:  Has Israel  no sons? has he no heir? why then does Malcam possess Gad,  and his people well in the cities of it?
049:002 Therefore, behold, the days come, says Yahweh, that I will cause  an alarm of war to be heard against Rabbah of the children of Ammon;  and it shall become a desolate heap, and her daughters shall  be burned with fire:  then shall Israel possess those who did  possess him, says Yahweh.
049:003 Wail, Heshbon, for Ai is laid waste; cry, you daughters of Rabbah,  gird you with sackcloth:  lament, and run back and forth  among the fences; for Malcam shall go into captivity,  his priests and his princes together.
049:004 Why glory you in the valleys, your flowing valley, backsliding  daughter? who trusted in her treasures, [saying], Who shall  come to me?
049:005 Behold, I will bring a fear on you, says the Lord, Yahweh of Armies,  from all who are round about you; and you shall be driven  out every man right forth, and there shall be none to gather  together the fugitives.
049:006 But afterward I will bring back the captivity of the children  of Ammon, says Yahweh.
049:007 Of Edom.  Thus says Yahweh of Armies:  Is wisdom no more in Teman?  is counsel perished from the prudent? is their wisdom vanished?
049:008 Flee you, turn back, dwell in the depths, inhabitants of Dedan;  for I will bring the calamity of Esau on him, the time that I  shall visit him.
049:009 If grape gatherers came to you, would they not leave some  gleaning grapes? if thieves by night, wouldn't they destroy  until they had enough?
049:010 But I have made Esau bare, I have uncovered his secret places,  and he shall not be able to hide himself:  his seed is destroyed,  and his brothers, and his neighbors; and he is no more.
049:011 Leave your fatherless children, I will preserve them alive;  and let your widows trust in me.
049:012 For thus says Yahweh:  Behold, they to whom it didn't pertain  to drink of the cup shall certainly drink; and are you he who  shall altogether go unpunished? you shall not go unpunished,  but you shall surely drink.
049:013 For I have sworn by myself, says Yahweh, that Bozrah shall  become an astonishment, a reproach, a waste, and a curse;  and all the cities of it shall be perpetual wastes.
049:014 I have heard news from Yahweh, and an ambassador is sent  among the nations, [saying], Gather yourselves together,  and come against her, and rise up to the battle.
049:015 For, behold, I have made you small among the nations,  and despised among men.
049:016 As for your terror, the pride of your heart has deceived you,  O you who dwell in the clefts of the rock, who hold the height  of the hill:  though you should make your nest as high  as the eagle, I will bring you down from there, says Yahweh.
049:017 Edom shall become an astonishment:  everyone who passes by it  shall be astonished, and shall hiss at all the plagues of it.
049:018 As in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbor  cities of it, says Yahweh, no man shall dwell there,  neither shall any son of man sojourn therein.
049:019 Behold, he shall come up like a lion from the pride of the Jordan  against the strong habitation:  for I will suddenly make them run  away from it; and whoever is chosen, him will I appoint over it:  for who is like me? and who will appoint me a time? and who is  the shepherd who will stand before me?
049:020 Therefore hear the counsel of Yahweh, that he has taken  against Edom; and his purposes, that he has purposed against  the inhabitants of Teman:  Surely they shall drag them away,  [even] the little ones of the flock; surely he shall make  their habitation desolate over them.
049:021 The earth trembles at the noise of their fall; there is a cry,  the noise which is heard in the Red Sea{or, Sea of Reeds}.
049:022 Behold, he shall come up and fly as the eagle, and spread  out his wings against Bozrah:  and the heart of the mighty  men of Edom at that day shall be as the heart of a woman  in her pangs.
049:023 Of Damascus.  Hamath is confounded, and Arpad; for they have heard  evil news, they are melted away:  there is sorrow on the sea;  it can't be quiet.
049:024 Damascus has grown feeble, she turns herself to flee,  and trembling has seized on her:  anguish and sorrows have  taken hold of her, as of a woman in travail.
049:025 How is the city of praise not forsaken, the city of my joy?
049:026 Therefore her young men shall fall in her streets, and all  the men of war shall be brought to silence in that day,  says Yahweh of Armies.
049:027 I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus, and it shall  devour the palaces of Ben Hadad.
049:028 Of Kedar, and of the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadnezzar  king of Babylon struck.  Thus says Yahweh:  Arise you,  go up to Kedar, and destroy the children of the east.
049:029 Their tents and their flocks shall they take; they shall carry  away for themselves their curtains, and all their vessels,  and their camels; and they shall cry to them, Terror on every side!
049:030 Flee you, wander far off, dwell in the depths, you inhabitants  of Hazor, says Yahweh; for Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon has taken  counsel against you, and has conceived a purpose against you.
049:031 Arise, go up to a nation that is at ease, that dwells  without care, says Yahweh; that have neither gates nor bars,  that dwell alone.
049:032 Their camels shall be a booty, and the multitude of their  livestock a spoil:  and I will scatter to all winds those who  have the corners [of their hair] cut off; and I will bring  their calamity from every side of them, says Yahweh.
049:033 Hazor shall be a dwelling place of jackals, a desolation forever:  no man shall dwell there, neither shall any son of  man sojourn therein.
050:001 The word that Yahweh spoke concerning Babylon, concerning the land  of the Chaldeans, by Jeremiah the prophet.
050:002 Declare you among the nations and publish, and set up  a standard; publish, and don't conceal:  say, Babylon is taken,  Bel is disappointed, Merodach is dismayed; her images  are disappointed, her idols are dismayed.
050:003 For out of the north there comes up a nation against her,  which shall make her land desolate, and none shall dwell therein:  they are fled, they are gone, both man and animal.
050:004 In those days, and in that time, says Yahweh, the children  of Israel shall come, they and the children of Judah together;  they shall go on their way weeping, and shall seek  Yahweh their God.
050:005 They shall inquire concerning Zion with their faces turned  toward it, [saying], Come you, and join yourselves to Yahweh  in an everlasting covenant that shall not be forgotten.
050:006 My people have been lost sheep:  their shepherds have caused  them to go astray; they have turned them away on the mountains;  they have gone from mountain to hill; they have forgotten  their resting place.
050:007 All who found them have devoured them; and their adversaries said,  We are not guilty, because they have sinned against Yahweh,  the habitation of righteousness, even Yahweh, the hope  of their fathers.
050:008 Flee out of the midst of Babylon, and go forth out of the land  of the Chaldeans, and be as the male goats before the flocks.
050:009 For, behold, I will stir up and cause to come up against Babylon  a company of great nations from the north country; and they  shall set themselves in array against her; from there she shall  be taken:  their arrows shall be as of an expert mighty man;  none shall return in vain.
050:010 Chaldea shall be a prey:  all who prey on her shall  be satisfied, says Yahweh.
050:011 Because you are glad, because you rejoice, O you who plunder  my heritage, because you are wanton as a heifer that treads  out [the grain], and neigh as strong horses;
050:012 your mother shall be utterly disappointed; she who bore you shall  be confounded:  behold, she shall be the least of the nations,  a wilderness, a dry land, and a desert.
050:013 Because of the wrath of Yahweh she shall not be inhabited,  but she shall be wholly desolate:  everyone who goes by Babylon  shall be astonished, and hiss at all her plagues.
050:014 Set yourselves in array against Babylon round about,  all you who bend the bow; shoot at her, spare no arrows:  for she has sinned against Yahweh.
050:015 Shout against her round about:  she has submitted herself;  her bulwarks are fallen, her walls are thrown down;  for it is the vengeance of Yahweh:  take vengeance on her;  as she has done, do to her.
050:016 Cut off the sower from Babylon, and him who handles the sickle  in the time of harvest:  for fear of the oppressing sword  they shall turn everyone to his people, and they shall flee  everyone to his own land.
050:017 Israel is a hunted sheep; the lions have driven him away:  first, the king of Assyria devoured him; and now at last  Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon has broken his bones.
050:018 Therefore thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel:  Behold, I  will punish the king of Babylon and his land, as I have punished  the king of Assyria.
050:019 I will bring Israel again to his pasture, and he shall feed  on Carmel and Bashan, and his soul shall be satisfied on  the hills of Ephraim and in Gilead.
050:020 In those days, and in that time, says Yahweh, the iniquity  of Israel shall be sought for, and there shall be none;  and the sins of Judah, and they shall not be found:  for I will pardon them whom I leave as a remnant.
050:021 Go up against the land of Merathaim, even against it, and against  the inhabitants of Pekod:  kill and utterly destroy after them,  says Yahweh, and do according to all that I have commanded you.
050:022 A sound of battle is in the land, and of great destruction.
050:023 How is the hammer of the whole earth cut apart and broken!  how is Babylon become a desolation among the nations!
050:024 I have laid a snare for you, and you are also taken, Babylon,  and you weren't aware:  you are found, and also caught,  because you have striven against Yahweh.
050:025 Yahweh has opened his armory, and has brought forth the weapons  of his indignation; for the Lord, Yahweh of Armies, has a work  [to do] in the land of the Chaldeans.
050:026 Come against her from the utmost border; open her storehouses;  cast her up as heaps, and destroy her utterly; let nothing  of her be left.
004:027 neither give place to the devil.
004:028 Let him who stole steal no more; but rather let him labor,  working with his hands the thing that is good, that he may  have something to give to him who has need.
004:029 Let no corrupt speech proceed out of your mouth, but such as is  good for building up as the need may be, that it may give  grace to those who hear.
004:030 Don't grieve the Holy Spirit of God, in whom you were sealed  for the day of redemption.
004:031 Let all bitterness, wrath, anger, outcry, and slander,  be put away from you, with all malice.
006:023 Peace be to the brothers, and love with faith, from God  the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
006:024 Grace be with all those who love our Lord Jesus Christ with  incorruptible love.  Amen.Book 50 Philippians
006:025 When they found him on the other side of the sea, they asked him,  "Rabbi, when did you come here?"
006:026 Jesus answered them, "Most certainly I tell you, you seek me,  not because you saw signs, but because you ate of the loaves,  and were filled.
006:027 Don't work for the food which perishes, but for the food which  remains to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give to you.  For God the Father has sealed him."
006:028 They said therefore to him, "What must we do, that we may work  the works of God?"
006:029 Jesus answered them, "This is the work of God, that you believe  in him whom he has sent."
006:030 They said therefore to him, "What then do you do for a sign,  that we may see, and believe you?  What work do you do?
007:025 Therefore he is also able to save to the uttermost those who draw  near to God through him, seeing that he lives forever to make  intercession for them.
008:023 As for Titus, he is my partner and fellow worker for you.  As for our brothers, they are the apostles of the assemblies,  the glory of Christ.
008:024 Therefore show the proof of your love to them in front  of the assemblies, and of our boasting on your behalf.
008:025 But if we hope for that which we don't see, we wait for  it with patience.
008:026 In the same way, the Spirit also helps our weaknesses, for we  don't know how to pray as we ought.  But the Spirit himself  makes intercession for us with groanings which can't be uttered.
008:027 He who searches the hearts knows what is on the Spirit's mind,  because he makes intercession for the saints according to God.
008:028 We know that all things work together for good for those who  love God, to those who are called according to his purpose.
008:029 For whom he foreknew, he also predestined to be conformed  to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn  among many brothers.{The word for "brothers" here and where  context allows may also be correctly translated "brothers  and sisters" or "siblings."}
008:030 Whom he predestined, those he also called.  Whom he called, those he also justified.  Whom he justified,  those he also glorified.
008:031 What then shall we say about these things?  If God is for us,  who can be against us?
008:032 He who didn't spare his own Son, but delivered him up for us all,  how would he not also with him freely give us all things?
009:030 What shall we say then?  That the Gentiles, who didn't  follow after righteousness, attained to righteousness,  even the righteousness which is of faith;
009:031 but Israel, following after a law of righteousness, didn't arrive  at the law of righteousness.
009:032 Why?  Because they didn't seek it by faith, but as it were  by works of the law.  They stumbled over the stumbling stone;
009:033 even as it is written, "Behold, I lay in Zion a stumbling  stone and a rock of offense; and no one who believes in him  will be disappointed."{Isaiah 8:14; 28:16}
009:034 Peter said to him, "Aeneas, Jesus Christ heals you.  Get up and make your bed!"  Immediately he arose.
009:035 All who lived at Lydda and in Sharon saw him, and they turned  to the Lord.
012:021 and so fearful was the appearance, that Moses said, "I am  terrified and trembling."{Deuteronomy 9:19}
012:022 But you have come to Mount Zion, and to the city of the living God,  the heavenly Jerusalem, and to innumerable multitudes of angels,
012:023 to the general assembly and assembly of the firstborn who are  enrolled in heaven, to God the Judge of all, to the spirits  of just men made perfect,
012:024 to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant,{Jeremiah 31:31}  and to the blood of sprinkling that speaks better than  that of Abel.
012:025 See that you don't refuse him who speaks.  For if they didn't  escape when they refused him who warned on the Earth,  how much more will we not escape who turn away from him  who warns from heaven,
012:026 whose voice shook the earth then, but now he has promised,  saying, "Yet once more I will shake not only the earth,  but also the heavens."{Haggai 2:6}
012:027 This phrase, "Yet once more," signifies the removing of those  things that are shaken, as of things that have been made,  that those things which are not shaken may remain.
012:028 Therefore, receiving a Kingdom that can't be shaken,  let us have grace, through which we serve God acceptably,  with reverence and awe,
012:029 for our God is a consuming fire.{Deuteronomy 4:24}
012:030 Do all have gifts of healings?  Do all speak with various languages?  Do all interpret?
012:031 But earnestly desire the best gifts.  Moreover, I show a most  excellent way to you.
012:032 And I, if I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all  people to myself."
012:033 But he said this, signifying by what kind of death he should die.
012:034 The multitude answered him, "We have heard out of the law  that the Christ remains forever.{Isaiah 9:7; Daniel 2:44  (but see also Isaiah 53:8)} How do you say, 'The Son of Man  must be lifted up?'  Who is this Son of Man?"
012:035 Jesus therefore said to them, "Yet a little while the light  is with you.  Walk while you have the light, that darkness  doesn't overtake you.  He who walks in the darkness doesn't  know where he is going.
012:036 While you have the light, believe in the light, that you  may become children of light."  Jesus said these things,  and he departed and hid himself from them.
012:037 But though he had done so many signs before them, yet they  didn't believe in him,
012:038 that the word of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled,  which he spoke, "Lord, who has believed our report?  To whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?"{Isaiah 53:1}
012:039 For this cause they couldn't believe, for Isaiah said again,
012:040 "He has blinded their eyes and he hardened their heart, lest they  should see with their eyes, and perceive with their heart,  and would turn, and I would heal them."{Isaiah 6:10}
012:041 Isaiah said these things when he saw his glory, and spoke  of him.{Isaiah 6:1}
012:042 Nevertheless even of the rulers many believed in him,  but because of the Pharisees they didn't confess it,  so that they wouldn't be put out of the synagogue,
012:043 for they loved men's praise more than God's praise.
012:044 Jesus cried out and said, "Whoever believes in me, believes not  in me, but in him who sent me.
012:045 He who sees me sees him who sent me.
012:046 I have come as a light into the world, that whoever believes  in me may not remain in the darkness.
012:047 If anyone listens to my sayings, and doesn't believe,  I don't judge him.  For I came not to judge the world,  but to save the world.
012:048 He who rejects me, and doesn't receive my sayings, has one  who judges him.  The word that I spoke, the same will judge  him in the last day.
012:049 For I spoke not from myself, but the Father who sent me, he gave  me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.
012:050 I know that his commandment is eternal life.  The things  therefore which I speak, even as the Father has said to me,  so I speak."
012:051 Do you think that I have come to give peace in the earth?  I tell you, no, but rather division.
013:019 I strongly urge you to do this, that I may be restored  to you sooner.
013:020 Now may the God of peace, who brought again from the dead the great  shepherd of the sheep with the blood of an eternal covenant,  our Lord Jesus,
013:021 make you complete in every good work to do his will, working in you  that which is well pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ,  to whom be the glory forever and ever.  Amen.
013:022 But I exhort you, brothers, endure the word of exhortation,  for I have written to you in few words.
014:025 And thus the secrets of his heart are revealed.  So he will  fall down on his face and worship God, declaring that God  is among you indeed.
014:026 What is it then, brothers?  When you come together,  each one of you has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation,  has another language, has an interpretation.  Let all things  be done to build each other up.
014:027 If any man speaks in another language, let it be two,  or at the most three, and in turn; and let one interpret.
014:028 But if there is no interpreter, let him keep silent in the assembly,  and let him speak to himself, and to God.
014:029 Let the prophets speak, two or three, and let the others discern.
014:030 But if a revelation is made to another sitting by,  let the first keep silent.
014:031 For you all can prophesy one by one, that all may learn,  and all may be exhorted.
015:022 For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all will be made alive.
015:023 But each in his own order:  Christ the first fruits,  then those who are Christ's, at his coming.
015:024 Then the end comes, when he will deliver up the Kingdom to God,  even the Father; when he will have abolished all rule and all  authority and power.
015:025 For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet.
015:026 The last enemy that will be abolished is death.
015:027 For, "He put all things in subjection under his feet."{Psalm
016:017 The seventh poured out his bowl into the air.  A loud voice came forth out of the temple of heaven,  from the throne, saying, "It is done!"
016:018 There were lightnings, sounds, and thunders; and there was  a great earthquake, such as was not since there were men  on the earth, so great an earthquake, so mighty.
016:019 The great city was divided into three parts, and the cities  of the nations fell.  Babylon the great was remembered  in the sight of God, to give to her the cup of the wine  of the fierceness of his wrath.
016:020 Every island fled away, and the mountains were not found.
016:021 Great hailstones, about the weight of a talent,{1 talent is about  34 kilograms or 75 pounds} came down out of the sky on people.  People blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail,  for this plague is exceedingly severe.
016:022 If any man doesn't love the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be  accursed{Greek: anathema.}. Come, Lord!{Aramaic: Maranatha!}
016:023 The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
016:024 My love to all of you in Christ Jesus.  Amen.Book 47 2 Corinthians

016:026 {See Romans 14:23}
016:027 {See Romans 14:23} {TR places Romans 14:24-26 at the end  of Romans instead of at the end of chapter 14, and numbers  these verses 16:25-27.}Book 46 1 Corinthians
016:028 But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, "Don't harm yourself,  for we are all here!"
016:029 He called for lights and sprang in, and, fell down trembling  before Paul and Silas,
016:030 and brought them out and said, "Sirs, what must I do to be saved?"
016:031 They said, "Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and you will  be saved, you and your household."
016:032 They spoke the word of the Lord to him, and to all who were  in his house.
016:033 He took them the same hour of the night, and washed their stripes,  and was immediately baptized, he and all his household.
016:034 He brought them up into his house, and set food before them,  and rejoiced greatly, with all his household, having  believed in God.
016:035 But when it was day, the magistrates sent the sergeants,  saying, "Let those men go."
016:036 The jailer reported these words to Paul, saying, "The magistrates  have sent to let you go; now therefore come out, and go in peace."
020:019 serving the Lord with all humility, with many tears,  and with trials which happened to me by the plots of the Jews;
020:020 how I didn't shrink from declaring to you anything that  was profitable, teaching you publicly and from house to house,
020:021 testifying both to Jews and to Greeks repentance toward God,  and faith toward our Lord Jesus.{TR adds "Christ"}
020:022 Now, behold, I go bound by the Spirit to Jerusalem, not knowing  what will happen to me there;
020:023 except that the Holy Spirit testifies in every city,  saying that bonds and afflictions wait for me.
020:024 But these things don't count; nor do I hold my life dear to myself,  so that I may finish my race with joy, and the ministry which I  received from the Lord Jesus, to fully testify to the Good News  of the grace of God.
020:025 "Now, behold, I know that you all, among whom I went about  preaching the Kingdom of God, will see my face no more.
020:026 Therefore I testify to you this day that I am clean from  the blood of all men,
021:035 When he came to the stairs, it happened that he was carried  by the soldiers because of the violence of the crowd;
021:036 for the multitude of the people followed after, crying out,  "Away with him!"
022:025 When they had tied him up with thongs, Paul asked the centurion  who stood by, "Is it lawful for you to scourge a man who is  a Roman, and not found guilty?"
022:026 When the centurion heard it, he went to the commanding officer  and told him, "Watch what you are about to do, for this man  is a Roman!"
022:027 The commanding officer came and asked him, "Tell me, are you  a Roman?"  He said, "Yes."
022:028 The commanding officer answered, "I bought my citizenship  for a great price."  Paul said, "But I was born a Roman."
022:029 Immediately those who were about to examine him departed from him,  and the commanding officer also was afraid when he realized  that he was a Roman, because he had bound him.
022:030 But on the next day, desiring to know the truth about why he was  accused by the Jews, he freed him from the bonds, and commanded  the chief priests and all the council to come together,  and brought Paul down and set him before them.
022:031 The Lord said, "Simon, Simon, behold, Satan asked to have you,  that he might sift you as wheat,
023:021 Therefore don't yield to them, for more than forty men lie  in wait for him, who have bound themselves under a curse  neither to eat nor to drink until they have killed him.  Now they are ready, looking for the promise from you."
023:022 So the commanding officer let the young man go, charging him,  "Tell no one that you have revealed these things to me."
023:023 He called to himself two of the centurions, and said,  "Prepare two hundred soldiers to go as far as Caesarea,  with seventy horsemen, and two hundred men armed with spears,  at the third hour of the night{about 9:00 PM}."
023:024 He asked them to provide animals, that they might set Paul on one,  and bring him safely to Felix the governor.
023:025 He wrote a letter like this:
023:026 "Claudius Lysias to the most excellent governor Felix:  Greetings.
023:027 "This man was seized by the Jews, and was about to be killed  by them, when I came with the soldiers and rescued him,  having learned that he was a Roman.
023:028 Desiring to know the cause why they accused him, I brought  him down to their council.
023:029 I found him to be accused about questions of their law,  but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death  or of bonds.
023:030 When I was told that the Jews lay in wait for the man, I sent  him to you immediately, charging his accusers also to bring  their accusations against him before you.  Farewell."
023:031 So the soldiers, carrying out their orders, took Paul and brought  him by night to Antipatris.
023:032 But on the next day they left the horsemen to go with him,  and returned to the barracks.
023:033 When they came to Caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor,  they also presented Paul to him.
025:035 for I was hungry, and you gave me food to eat; I was thirsty,  and you gave me drink; I was a stranger, and you took me in;
025:036 naked, and you clothed me; I was sick, and you visited me;  I was in prison, and you came to me.'
025:037 "Then the righteous will answer him, saying, 'Lord, when did we  see you hungry, and feed you; or thirsty, and give you a drink?
025:038 When did we see you as a stranger, and take you in; or naked,  and clothe you?
025:039 When did we see you sick, or in prison, and come to you?'
025:040 "The King will answer them, 'Most certainly I tell you,  inasmuch as you did it to one of the least of these my  brothers{The word for "brothers" here may be also correctly  translated "brothers and sisters" or "siblings."}, you did  it to me.'
026:036 Then Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemane, and said  to his disciples, "Sit here, while I go there and pray."
026:037 He took with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, and began  to be sorrowful and severely troubled.
028:023 When they had appointed him a day, many people came to him  at his lodging.  He explained to them, testifying about  the Kingdom of God, and persuading them concerning Jesus,  both from the law of Moses and from the prophets,  from morning until evening.
028:024 Some believed the things which were spoken, and some disbelieved.
028:025 When they didn't agree among themselves, they departed after  Paul had spoken one word, "The Holy Spirit spoke rightly  through Isaiah, the prophet, to our fathers,
028:026 saying, 'Go to this people, and say, in hearing, you will hear,  but will in no way understand.  In seeing, you will see,  but will in no way perceive.
028:027 For this people's heart has grown callous.  Their ears  are dull of hearing.  Their eyes they have closed.  Lest they should see with their eyes, hear with their ears,  understand with their heart, and would turn again, and I  would heal them.'{Isaiah 6:9-10}
028:028 "Be it known therefore to you, that the salvation of God  is sent to the nations.  They will also listen."
028:029 When he had said these words, the Jews departed, having a great  dispute among themselves.
028:030 Paul stayed two whole years in his own rented house,  and received all who were coming to him,
028:031 preaching the Kingdom of God, and teaching the things concerning  the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness, without hindrance.Book 45 Romans
028:032 Your sons and your daughters shall be given to another people;  and your eyes shall look, and fail with longing for them all  the day:  and there shall be nothing in the power of your hand.
028:033 The fruit of your ground, and all your labors, shall a nation  which you don't know eat up; and you shall be only oppressed  and crushed always;
028:034 so that you shall be mad for the sight of your eyes which  you shall see.
028:035 Yahweh will strike you in the knees, and in the legs,  with a sore boil, of which you can not be healed, from the sole  of your foot to the crown of your head.
028:036 Yahweh will bring you, and your king whom you shall set over you,  to a nation that you have not known, you nor your fathers;  and there shall you serve other gods, wood and stone.
028:037 You shall become an astonishment, a proverb, and a byword,  among all the peoples where Yahweh shall lead you away.
028:038 You shall carry much seed out into the field, and shall gather  little in; for the locust shall consume it.
028:039 You shall plant vineyards and dress them, but you shall  neither drink of the wine, nor gather [the grapes];  for the worm shall eat them.
028:040 You shall have olive trees throughout all your borders,  but you shall not anoint yourself with the oil; for your olive  shall cast [its fruit].
028:041 You shall father sons and daughters, but they shall not be yours;  for they shall go into captivity.
028:042 All your trees and the fruit of your ground shall the locust possess.
028:043 The foreigner who is in the midst of you shall mount up above  you higher and higher; and you shall come down lower and lower.
029:036 Hezekiah rejoiced, and all the people, because of that which God  had prepared for the people:  for the thing was done suddenly.
029:037 their meal offering and their drink offerings for the bull,  for the ram, and for the lambs, shall be according to their number,  after the ordinance:
029:038 and one male goat for a sin offering, besides the continual  burnt offering, and the meal offering of it, and the drink  offering of it.
029:039 These you shall offer to Yahweh in your set feasts, besides your vows,  and your freewill offerings, for your burnt offerings,  and for your meal offerings, and for your drink offerings,  and for your peace offerings.
029:040 Moses told the children of Israel according to all that  Yahweh commanded Moses.
029:041 The other lamb you shall offer at evening, and shall do to it  according to the meal offering of the morning, and according  to its drink offering, for a sweet savor, an offering made  by fire to Yahweh.
029:042 It shall be a continual burnt offering throughout your  generations at the door of the tent of meeting before Yahweh,  where I will meet with you, to speak there to you.
029:043 There I will meet with the children of Israel; and the place  shall be sanctified by my glory.
029:044 I will sanctify the tent of meeting and the altar:  Aaron also and his sons I will sanctify, to minister to me  in the priest's office.
029:045 I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will be their God.
029:046 They shall know that I am Yahweh their God, who brought them  forth out of the land of Egypt, that I might dwell among them:  I am Yahweh their God.
032:033 They have turned to me the back, and not the face:  and though I taught them, rising up early and teaching them,  yet they have not listened to receive instruction.
032:034 But they set their abominations in the house which is called  by my name, to defile it.
032:035 They built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley  of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters  to pass through [the fire] to Molech; which I didn't  command them, neither did it come into my mind, that they  should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin.
033:021 It happened in the twelfth year of our captivity, in the  tenth [month], in the fifth [day] of the month, that one  who had escaped out of Jerusalem came to me, saying, The city  has been struck.
033:022 Now the hand of Yahweh had been on me in the evening,  before he who was escaped came; and he had opened my mouth,  until he came to me in the morning; and my mouth was opened,  and I was no more mute.
033:023 The word of Yahweh came to me, saying,
034:032 Teach me that which I don't see.  If I have done iniquity,  I will do it no more'?
034:033 Shall his recompense be as you desire, that you refuse it?  For you must choose, and not I. Therefore speak what you know.
034:034 Men of understanding will tell me, yes, every wise man  who hears me:
034:035 'Job speaks without knowledge.  His words are without wisdom.'
035:030 Whoever kills any person, the murderer shall be slain at  the mouth of witnesses:  but one witness shall not testify  against any person that he die.
035:031 Moreover you shall take no ransom for the life of a murderer  who is guilty of death; but he shall surely be put to death.
035:032 You shall take no ransom for him who is fled to his city  of refuge, that he may come again to dwell in the land,  until the death of the priest.
035:033 So you shall not pollute the land in which you are:  for blood, it pollutes the land; and no expiation can  be made for the land for the blood that is shed therein,  but by the blood of him who shed it.
035:034 You shall not defile the land which you inhabit, in the midst  of which I dwell:  for I, Yahweh, dwell in the midst of  the children of Israel.
035:035 He has filled them with wisdom of heart, to work all manner  of workmanship, of the engraver, of the skillful workman,  and of the embroiderer, in blue, in purple, in scarlet,  and in fine linen, and of the weaver, even of those who do  any workmanship, and of those who make skillful works.
038:031 "Can you bind the cluster of the Pleiades, or loosen  the cords of Orion?
039:024 According to their uncleanness and according to their  transgressions did I to them; and I hid my face from them.
039:025 Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh:  Now will I bring back  the captivity of Jacob, and have mercy on the whole house  of Israel; and I will be jealous for my holy name.
039:026 They shall bear their shame, and all their trespasses by  which they have trespassed against me, when they shall dwell  securely in their land, and none shall make them afraid;
039:027 when I have brought them back from the peoples, and gathered  them out of their enemies' lands, and am sanctified in them  in the sight of many nations.
039:028 They shall know that I am Yahweh their God, in that I caused  them to go into captivity among the nations, and have gathered  them to their own land; and I will leave none of them  any more there;
039:029 neither will I hide my face any more from them; for I have poured  out my Spirit on the house of Israel, says the Lord Yahweh.
039:030 His young ones also suck up blood.  Where the slain are,  there he is."
039:031 They tied to it a lace of blue, to fasten it on the turban above,  as Yahweh commanded Moses.
039:032 Thus all the work of the tent of the tent of meeting was finished.  The children of Israel did according to all that Yahweh  commanded Moses; so they did.
039:033 They brought the tent to Moses, the tent, with all its furniture,  its clasps, its boards, its bars, its pillars, its sockets,
039:034 the covering of rams' skins dyed red, the covering of sea  cow hides, the veil of the screen,
039:035 the ark of the testimony with its poles, the mercy seat,
039:036 the table, all its vessels, the show bread,
039:037 the pure lampstand, its lamps, even the lamps to be set in order,  all its vessels, the oil for the light,
039:038 the golden altar, the anointing oil, the sweet incense,  the screen for the door of the Tent,
039:039 the bronze altar, its grating of brass, its poles, all of  its vessels, the basin and its base,
039:040 the hangings of the court, its pillars, its sockets,  the screen for the gate of the court, its cords, its pins,  all the instruments of the service of the tent, for the  tent of meeting,
039:041 the finely worked garments for ministering in the holy place,  the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments  of his sons, to minister in the priest's office.
039:042 According to all that Yahweh commanded Moses, so the children  of Israel did all the work.
039:043 Moses saw all the work, and behold, they had done it  as Yahweh had commanded, even so had they done it:  and Moses blessed them.
040:024 He led me toward the south; and behold, a gate toward the south:  and he measured the posts of it and the arches of it according  to these measures.
040:025 There were windows in it and in the arches of it round about,  like those windows:  the length was fifty cubits,  and the breadth twenty-five cubits.
040:026 There were seven steps to go up to it, and the arches of it  were before them; and it had palm trees, one on this side,  and another on that side, on the posts of it.
040:027 There was a gate to the inner court toward the south:  and he measured from gate to gate toward the south  a hundred cubits.
040:028 Then he brought me to the inner court by the south gate:  and he measured the south gate according to these measures;
040:029 and the lodges of it, and the posts of it, and the arches of it,  according to these measures:  and there were windows in it  and in the arches of it round about; it was fifty cubits long,  and twenty-five cubits broad.
040:030 There were arches round about, twenty-five cubits long,  and five cubits broad.
040:031 The arches of it were toward the outer court; and palm trees  were on the posts of it:  and the ascent to it had eight steps.
040:032 He brought me into the inner court toward the east:  and he measured the gate according to these measures;
040:033 and the lodges of it, and the posts of it, and the arches of it,  according to these measures:  and there were windows therein  and in the arches of it round about; it was fifty cubits long,  and twenty-five cubits broad.
040:034 The arches of it were toward the outer court; and palm trees  were on the posts of it, on this side, and on that side:  and the ascent to it had eight steps.
040:035 He brought me to the north gate:  and he measured [it] according  to these measures;
040:036 the lodges of it, the posts of it, and the arches of it:  and there were windows therein round about; the length was  fifty cubits, and the breadth twenty-five cubits.
040:037 The posts of it were toward the outer court; and palm trees  were on the posts of it, on this side, and on that side:  and the ascent to it had eight steps.
040:038 A chamber with the door of it was by the posts at the gates;  there they washed the burnt offering.
004:032 And be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving each other,  just as God also in Christ forgave you.
004:033 With great power, the apostles gave their testimony of the  resurrection of the Lord Jesus.  Great grace was on them all.
004:034 For neither was there among them any who lacked, for as many  as were owners of lands or houses sold them, and brought  the proceeds of the things that were sold,
004:035 and laid them at the apostles' feet, and distribution was made  to each, according as anyone had need.
007:026 For such a high priest was fitting for us:  holy, guiltless,  undefiled, separated from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;
007:027 who doesn't need, like those high priests, to offer up sacrifices  daily, first for his own sins, and then for the sins of the people.  For he did this once for all, when he offered up himself.
007:028 For the law appoints men as high priests who have weakness,  but the word of the oath which came after the law appoints  a Son forever who has been perfected.
007:029 But I say this, brothers:  the time is short, that from now on,  both those who have wives may be as though they had none;
007:030 and those who weep, as though they didn't weep; and those  who rejoice, as though they didn't rejoice; and those who buy,  as though they didn't possess;
007:031 and those who use the world, as not using it to the fullest.  For the mode of this world passes away.
007:032 But I desire to have you to be free from cares.  He who is unmarried is concerned for the things of the Lord,  how he may please the Lord;
007:033 but he who is married is concerned about the things of the world,  how he may please his wife.
007:034 There is also a difference between a wife and a virgin.  The unmarried woman cares about the things of the Lord,  that she may be holy both in body and in spirit.  But she who is married cares about the things of the world--  how she may please her husband.
007:035 This I say for your own profit; not that I may ensnare you,  but for that which is appropriate, and that you may attend  to the Lord without distraction.
007:036 But if any man thinks that he is behaving inappropriately  toward his virgin, if she is past the flower of her age,  and if need so requires, let him do what he desires.  He doesn't sin.  Let them marry.
007:037 But he who stands steadfast in his heart, having no necessity,  but has power over his own heart, to keep his own virgin, does well.
007:038 So then both he who gives his own virgin in marriage does well,  and he who doesn't give her in marriage does better.
008:033 Who could bring a charge against God's chosen ones?  It is God who justifies.
008:034 Who is he who condemns?  It is Christ who died, yes rather,  who was raised from the dead, who is at the right hand of God,  who also makes intercession for us.
008:035 Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?  Could oppression,  or anguish, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness,  or peril, or sword?
008:036 Even as it is written, "For your sake we are killed all day long.  We were accounted as sheep for the slaughter."{Psalm 44:22}
011:033 who, through faith subdued kingdoms, worked out righteousness,  obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,{Daniel 6:22-23}
011:034 quenched the power of fire,{Daniel 3:1-30} escaped the edge  of the sword,{1 Kings 19:1-3; 2 Kings 6:31-7:20} from weakness  were made strong, grew mighty in war, and caused foreign  armies to flee.
011:035 Women received their dead by resurrection.{1 Kings 19:1-3;  2 Kings 6:31-7:20} Others were tortured, not accepting  their deliverance, that they might obtain a better resurrection.
011:036 Others were tried by mocking and scourging, yes, moreover by  bonds and imprisonment.
011:037 They were stoned.{2 Chronicles 24:20-21} They were sawn apart.  They were tempted.  They were slain with the sword.{Jeremiah  26:20-23; 1 Kings 19:10} They went around in sheep skins  and in goat skins; being destitute, afflicted, ill-treated
011:038 (of whom the world was not worthy), wandering in deserts,  mountains, caves, and the holes of the earth.
011:039 These all, having had testimony given to them through their faith,  didn't receive the promise,
011:040 God having provided some better thing concerning us,  so that apart from us they should not be made perfect.
011:041 So they took away the stone from the place where the dead man  was lying.{NU omits "from the place where the dead man was  lying."} Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, "Father, I thank  you that you listened to me.
011:042 I know that you always listen to me, but because of the multitude  that stands around I said this, that they may believe that  you sent me."
011:043 When he had said this, he cried with a loud voice,  "Lazarus, come out!"
011:044 He who was dead came out, bound hand and foot with wrappings,  and his face was wrapped around with a cloth.  Jesus said  to them, "Free him, and let him go."
011:045 Therefore many of the Jews, who came to Mary and saw what Jesus did,  believed in him.
011:046 But some of them went away to the Pharisees, and told them  the things which Jesus had done.
011:047 The chief priests therefore and the Pharisees gathered a council,  and said, "What are we doing?  For this man does many signs.
013:023 Know that our brother Timothy has been freed, with whom,  if he comes shortly, I will see you.
013:024 Greet all of your leaders and all the saints.  The Italians greet you.
013:025 Grace be with you all.  Amen.Book 59 James
013:026 Brothers, children of the stock of Abraham, and those among you  who fear God, the word of this salvation is sent out to you.
013:027 For those who dwell in Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they  didn't know him, nor the voices of the prophets which are read  every Sabbath, fulfilled them by condemning him.
013:028 Though they found no cause for death, they still asked Pilate  to have him killed.
013:029 When they had fulfilled all things that were written about him,  they took him down from the tree, and laid him in a tomb.
013:030 But God raised him from the dead,
013:031 and he was seen for many days by those who came up with him  from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are his witnesses to the people.
013:032 We bring you good news of the promise made to the fathers,
013:033 that God has fulfilled the same to us, their children, in that  he raised up Jesus.  As it is also written in the second psalm,  'You are my Son.  Today I have become your father.'{Psalm 2:7}
013:034 "Concerning that he raised him up from the dead, now no more  to return to corruption, he has spoken thus:  'I will give  you the holy and sure blessings of David.'{Isaiah 55:3}
013:035 Therefore he says also in another psalm, 'You will not allow  your Holy One to see decay.'{Psalm 16:10}
013:036 For David, after he had in his own generation served the  counsel of God, fell asleep, and was laid with his fathers,  and saw decay.
013:037 But he whom God raised up saw no decay.
013:038 Be it known to you therefore, brothers{The word for "brothers"  here and where the context allows may also be correctly  translated "brothers and sisters" or "siblings."}, that through  this man is proclaimed to you remission of sins,
013:039 and by him everyone who believes is justified from all things,  from which you could not be justified by the law of Moses.
013:040 Beware therefore, lest that come on you which is spoken  in the prophets:
013:041 'Behold, you scoffers, and wonder, and perish; for I work  a work in your days, a work which you will in no way believe,  if one declares it to you.'"{Habakkuk 1:5}
013:042 So when the Jews went out of the synagogue, the Gentiles begged  that these words might be preached to them the next Sabbath.
013:043 Now when the synagogue broke up, many of the Jews and of the devout  proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas; who, speaking to them,  urged them to continue in the grace of God.
013:044 The next Sabbath almost the whole city was gathered together  to hear the word of God.
013:045 But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled  with jealousy, and contradicted the things which were spoken  by Paul, and blasphemed.
013:046 Paul and Barnabas spoke out boldly, and said, "It was  necessary that God's word should be spoken to you first.  Since indeed you thrust it from you, and judge yourselves  unworthy of eternal life, behold, we turn to the Gentiles.
013:047 For so has the Lord commanded us, saying, 'I have set you  as a light for the Gentiles, that you should bring salvation  to the uttermost parts of the earth.'"{Isaiah 49:6}
013:048 As the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified the word  of God.  As many as were appointed to eternal life believed.
013:049 The Lord's word was spread abroad throughout all the region.
013:050 But the Jews stirred up the devout and prominent women  and the chief men of the city, and stirred up a persecution  against Paul and Barnabas, and threw them out of their borders.
013:051 But they shook off the dust of their feet against them,  and came to Iconium.
013:052 The disciples were filled with joy with the Holy Spirit.
013:053 It happened that when Jesus had finished these parables,  he departed from there.
013:054 Coming into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue,  so that they were astonished, and said, "Where did this man  get this wisdom, and these mighty works?
013:055 Isn't this the carpenter's son?  Isn't his mother called Mary,  and his brothers, James, Joses, Simon, and Judas{or, Judah}?
013:056 Aren't all of his sisters with us?  Where then did this man  get all of these things?"
013:057 They were offended by him.  But Jesus said to them,  "A prophet is not without honor, except in his own country,  and in his own house."
013:058 He didn't do many mighty works there because of their unbelief.
013:059 This is the law of the plague of mildew in a garment of wool  or linen, either in the warp, or the woof, or in anything of skin,  to pronounce it clean, or to pronounce it unclean.
014:032 The spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets,
014:033 for God is not a God of confusion, but of peace.  As in all the assemblies of the saints,
014:034 let your wives keep silent in the assemblies, for it has not been  permitted for them to speak; but let them be in subjection,  as the law also says.
014:035 If they desire to learn anything, let them ask their own  husbands at home, for it is shameful for a woman to chatter  in the assembly.
014:036 What?  Was it from you that the word of God went out?  Or did it come to you alone?
014:037 If any man thinks himself to be a prophet, or spiritual,  let him recognize the things which I write to you, that they  are the commandment of the Lord.
014:038 But if anyone is ignorant, let him be ignorant.
014:039 Therefore, brothers, desire earnestly to prophesy, and don't  forbid speaking with other languages.
014:040 Let all things be done decently and in order.
014:041 He came the third time, and said to them, "Sleep on now,  and take your rest.  It is enough.  The hour has come.  Behold, the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.
014:042 Arise, let us be going.  Behold, he who betrays me is at hand."
014:043 Immediately, while he was still speaking, Judas, one of  the twelve, came--and with him a multitude with swords and clubs,  from the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders.
014:044 Now he who betrayed him had given them a sign, saying, "Whoever I  will kiss, that is he.  Seize him, and lead him away safely."
014:045 When he had come, immediately he came to him,  and said, "Rabbi!  Rabbi!" and kissed him.
014:046 They laid their hands on him, and seized him.
014:047 But a certain one of those who stood by drew his sword,  and struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.
014:048 Jesus answered them, "Have you come out, as against a robber,  with swords and clubs to seize me?
014:049 I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and you didn't  arrest me.  But this is so that the Scriptures might be fulfilled."
014:050 They all left him, and fled.
014:051 A certain young man followed him, having a linen cloth thrown  around himself, over his naked body.  The young men grabbed him,
014:052 but he left the linen cloth, and fled from them naked.
014:053 They led Jesus away to the high priest.  All the chief priests,  the elders, and the scribes came together with him.
014:054 Peter had followed him from a distance, until he came into  the court of the high priest.  He was sitting with the officers,  and warming himself in the light of the fire.
014:055 Now the chief priests and the whole council sought witnesses  against Jesus to put him to death, and found none.
014:056 For many gave false testimony against him, and their testimony  didn't agree with each other.
014:057 Some stood up, and gave false testimony against him, saying,
015:028 When all things have been subjected to him, then the Son will  also himself be subjected to him who subjected all things to him,  that God may be all in all.
015:029 Or else what will they do who are baptized for the dead?  If the dead aren't raised at all, why then are they baptized  for the dead?
015:030 Why do we also stand in jeopardy every hour?
015:031 I affirm, by the boasting in you which I have in Christ Jesus  our Lord, I die daily.
015:032 If I fought with animals at Ephesus for human purposes,  what does it profit me?  If the dead are not raised, then "let  us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die."{Isaiah 22:13}
015:033 Don't be deceived!  "Evil companionships corrupt good morals."
020:027 for I didn't shrink from declaring to you the whole counsel of God.
022:032 but I prayed for you, that your faith wouldn't fail.  You, when once you have turned again, establish your brothers{The  word for "brothers" here may be also correctly translated  "brothers and sisters" or "siblings."}."
022:033 He said to him, "Lord, I am ready to go with you both to prison  and to death!"
023:034 When the governor had read it, he asked what province he was from.  When he understood that he was from Cilicia, he said,
023:035 "I will hear you fully when your accusers also arrive."  He commanded that he be kept in Herod's palace.
023:036 The soldiers also mocked him, coming to him and offering him vinegar,
023:037 and saying, "If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself!"
023:038 An inscription was also written over him in letters  of Greek, Latin, and Hebrew:  "THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS."
023:039 One of the criminals who was hanged insulted him, saying, "If you  are the Christ, save yourself and us!"
023:040 But the other answered, and rebuking him said, "Don't you  even fear God, seeing you are under the same condemnation?
023:041 And we indeed justly, for we receive the due reward for our deeds,  but this man has done nothing wrong."
023:042 He said to Jesus, "Lord, remember me when you come  into your Kingdom."
023:043 Jesus said to him, "Assuredly I tell you, today you will be  with me in Paradise."
023:044 It was now about the sixth hour{Time was counted from sunrise,  so the sixth hour was about noon.}, and darkness came over  the whole land until the ninth hour.{3:00 PM}
025:041 Then he will say also to those on the left hand, 'Depart from me,  you cursed, into the eternal fire which is prepared for the devil  and his angels;
025:042 for I was hungry, and you didn't give me food to eat;  I was thirsty, and you gave me no drink;
025:043 I was a stranger, and you didn't take me in; naked, and you didn't  clothe me; sick, and in prison, and you didn't visit me.'
025:044 "Then they will also answer, saying, 'Lord, when did we see  you hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick,  or in prison, and didn't help you?'
025:045 "Then he will answer them, saying, 'Most certainly I tell you,  inasmuch as you didn't do it to one of the least of these,  you didn't do it to me.'
025:046 These will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous  into eternal life."
025:047 "'If a stranger or sojourner with you becomes rich,  and your brother beside him has grown poor, and sells himself  to the stranger or foreigner living among you, or to a member  of the stranger's family;
025:048 after he is sold he may be redeemed.  One of his brothers  may redeem him;
025:049 or his uncle, or his uncle's son, may redeem him, or any  who is a close relative to him of his family may redeem him;  or if he has grown rich, he may redeem himself.
025:050 He shall reckon with him who bought him from the year  that he sold himself to him to the Year of Jubilee:  and the price of his sale shall be according to the number  of years; according to the time of a hired servant shall  he be with him.
025:051 If there are yet many years, according to them he shall  give back the price of his redemption out of the money  that he was bought for.
025:052 If there remain but a few years to the year of jubilee,  then he shall reckon with him; according to his years of service  he shall give back the price of his redemption.
025:053 As a servant hired year by year shall he be with him:  he shall not rule with harshness over him in your sight.
025:054 If he isn't redeemed by these means, then he shall be released  in the Year of Jubilee, he, and his children with him.
025:055 For to me the children of Israel are servants; they are my  servants whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt.  I am Yahweh your God.
026:038 Then he said to them, "My soul is exceedingly sorrowful,  even to death.  Stay here, and watch with me."
026:039 He went forward a little, fell on his face, and prayed, saying,  "My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass away from me;  nevertheless, not what I desire, but what you desire."
026:040 He came to the disciples, and found them sleeping, and said  to Peter, "What, couldn't you watch with me for one hour?
026:041 Watch and pray, that you don't enter into temptation.  The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak."
026:042 Again, a second time he went away, and prayed, saying, "My Father,  if this cup can't pass away from me unless I drink it,  your desire be done."
026:043 He came again and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.
026:044 He left them again, went away, and prayed a third time,  saying the same words.
026:045 Then he came to his disciples, and said to them, "Sleep on now,  and take your rest.  Behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son  of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.
026:046 Arise, let's be going.  Behold, he who betrays me is at hand."
001:032 who, knowing the ordinance of God, that those who practice  such things are worthy of death, not only do the same,  but also approve of those who practice them.
001:033 I didn't recognize him, but he who sent me to baptize in water,  he said to me, 'On whomever you will see the Spirit descending,  and remaining on him, the same is he who baptizes in  the Holy Spirit.'
001:034 I have seen, and have testified that this is the Son of God."
001:035 Again, the next day, John was standing with two of his disciples,
001:036 and he looked at Jesus as he walked, and said, "Behold,  the Lamb of God!"
001:037 The two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.
001:038 Jesus turned, and saw them following, and said to them, "What are  you looking for?"  They said to him, "Rabbi" (which is to say,  being interpreted, Teacher), "where are you staying?"
001:039 He said to them, "Come, and see."  They came and saw  where he was staying, and they stayed with him that day.  It was about the tenth hour.{4:00 PM.}
001:040 One of the two who heard John, and followed him,  was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.
001:041 He first found his own brother, Simon, and said to him,  "We have found the Messiah!" (which is, being interpreted,  Christ{"Messiah" (Hebrew) and "Christ" (Greek) both mean  "Anointed One".}).
001:042 He brought him to Jesus.  Jesus looked at him, and said,  "You are Simon the son of Jonah.  You shall be called Cephas"  (which is by interpretation, Peter).
001:043 On the next day, he was determined to go out into Galilee,  and he found Philip.  Jesus said to him, "Follow me."
001:044 Now Philip was from Bethsaida, of the city of Andrew and Peter.
001:045 Philip found Nathanael, and said to him, "We have found him,  of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, wrote:  Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph."
001:046 Nathanael said to him, "Can any good thing come out  of Nazareth?"  Philip said to him, "Come and see."
001:047 Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and said about him, "Behold,  an Israelite indeed, in whom is no deceit!"
001:048 Nathanael said to him, "How do you know me?"  Jesus answered him,  "Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree,  I saw you."
001:049 Nathanael answered him, "Rabbi, you are the Son of God!  You are  King of Israel!"
001:050 Jesus answered him, "Because I told you, 'I saw you underneath  the fig tree,' do you believe?  You will see greater  things than these!"
001:051 He said to him, "Most certainly, I tell you, hereafter you  will see heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending  and descending on the Son of Man."
001:052 He has put down princes from their thrones.  And has  exalted the lowly.
001:053 He has filled the hungry with good things.  He has sent  the rich away empty.
001:054 He has given help to Israel, his servant, that he  might remember mercy,
002:026 He who overcomes, and he who keeps my works to the end,  to him I will give authority over the nations.
002:027 He will rule them with a rod of iron, shattering them like clay  pots;{Psalm 2:9} as I also have received of my Father:
002:028 and I will give him the morning star.
002:029 He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says  to the assemblies.
002:030 because for the work of Christ he came near to death,  risking his life to supply that which was lacking in your  service toward me.
002:031 he foreseeing this spoke about the resurrection of the Christ,  that neither was his soul left in Hades{or, Hell}, nor did  his flesh see decay.
002:032 This Jesus God raised up, to which we all are witnesses.
002:033 Being therefore exalted by the right hand of God, and having  received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit,  he has poured out this, which you now see and hear.
002:034 For David didn't ascend into the heavens, but he says himself,  'The Lord said to my Lord, "Sit by my right hand,
003:025 But he who does wrong will receive again for the wrong that  he has done, and there is no partiality.
003:026 For you are all children of God, through faith in Christ Jesus.
003:027 For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ.
003:028 There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor  free man, there is neither male nor female; for you are all  one in Christ Jesus.
003:029 If you are Christ's, then you are Abraham's seed and heirs  according to promise.
003:030 since indeed there is one God who will justify the circumcised  by faith, and the uncircumcised through faith.
003:031 Do we then nullify the law through faith?  May it never be!  No, we establish the law.
003:032 What he has seen and heard, of that he testifies; and no one  receives his witness.
003:033 He who has received his witness has set his seal to this,  that God is true.
003:034 For he whom God has sent speaks the words of God; for God  gives the Spirit without measure.
003:035 The Father loves the Son, and has given all things into his hand.
003:036 One who believes in the Son has eternal life, but one  who disobeys{The same word can be translated "disobeys"  or "disbelieves" in this context.} the Son won't see life,  but the wrath of God remains on him."
003:037 the son of Methuselah, the son of Enoch, the son of Jared,  the son of Mahalaleel, the son of Cainan,
003:038 the son of Enos, the son of Seth, the son of Adam, the son of God.
003:039 Why does a living man complain, a man for the punishment  of his sins?
003:040 Let us search and try our ways, and turn again to Yahweh.
003:041 Let us lift up our heart with our hands to God in the heavens.
003:042 We have transgressed and have rebelled; you have not pardoned.
003:043 You have covered with anger and pursued us; you have killed,  you have not pitied.
003:044 You have covered yourself with a cloud, so that no prayer  can pass through.
003:045 You have made us an off-scouring and refuse in the midst  of the peoples.
003:046 All our enemies have opened their mouth wide against us.
003:047 Fear and the pit are come on us, devastation and destruction.
003:048 My eye runs down with streams of water, for the destruction  of the daughter of my people.
003:049 My eye pours down, and doesn't cease, without any intermission,
003:050 Until Yahweh look down, and see from heaven.
003:051 My eye affects my soul, because of all the daughters of my city.
004:036 Joses, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas (which is,  being interpreted, Son of Encouragement), a Levite, a man  of Cyprus by race,
004:037 having a field, sold it, and brought the money and laid it  at the apostles' feet.
004:038 I sent you to reap that for which you haven't labored.  Others have labored, and you have entered into their labor."
004:039 From that city many of the Samaritans believed in him because of  the word of the woman, who testified, "He told me everything  that I did."
004:040 So when the Samaritans came to him, they begged him to stay  with them.  He stayed there two days.
004:041 Many more believed because of his word.
004:042 They said to the woman, "Now we believe, not because of your speaking;  for we have heard for ourselves, and know that this is indeed  the Christ, the Savior of the world."
004:043 After the two days he went out from there and went into Galilee.
004:044 For Jesus himself testified that a prophet has no honor  in his own country.
004:045 So when he came into Galilee, the Galileans received him,  having seen all the things that he did in Jerusalem at the feast,  for they also went to the feast.
004:046 Jesus came therefore again to Cana of Galilee, where he made  the water into wine.  There was a certain nobleman whose son  was sick at Capernaum.
004:047 When he heard that Jesus had come out of Judea into Galilee,  he went to him, and begged him that he would come down and heal  his son, for he was at the point of death.
004:048 Jesus therefore said to him, "Unless you see signs and wonders,  you will in no way believe."
004:049 The nobleman said to him, "Sir, come down before my child dies."
007:039 A wife is bound by law for as long as her husband lives;  but if the husband is dead, she is free to be married to whoever  she desires, only in the Lord.
007:040 But she is happier if she stays as she is, in my judgment,  and I think that I also have God's Spirit.
007:041 They made a calf in those days, and brought a sacrifice to the idol,  and rejoiced in the works of their hands.
007:042 But God turned, and gave them up to serve the army of the sky,  as it is written in the book of the prophets, 'Did you offer  to me slain animals and sacrifices forty years in the wilderness,  O house of Israel?
007:043 You took up the tent of Moloch, the star of your god Rephan,  the figures which you made to worship.  I will carry you  away{Amos 5:25-27} beyond Babylon.'
007:044 "Our fathers had the tent of the testimony in the wilderness,  even as he who spoke to Moses commanded him to make it  according to the pattern that he had seen;
007:045 which also our fathers, in their turn, brought in with Joshua  when they entered into the possession of the nations, whom God  drove out before the face of our fathers, to the days of David,
007:046 who found favor in the sight of God, and asked to find  a habitation for the God of Jacob.
007:047 But Solomon built him a house.
007:048 However, the Most High doesn't dwell in temples made with hands,  as the prophet says,
007:049 'heaven is my throne, and the earth a footstool for my feet.  What kind of house will you build me?' says the Lord;  'or what is the place of my rest?
007:050 Didn't my hand make all these things?'{Isaiah 66:1-2}
007:051 "You stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears,  you always resist the Holy Spirit!  As your fathers did,  so you do.
007:052 Which of the prophets didn't your fathers persecute?  They killed those who foretold the coming of the Righteous One,  of whom you have now become betrayers and murderers.
007:053 You received the law as it was ordained by angels,  and didn't keep it!"
007:054 Now when they heard these things, they were cut to the heart,  and they gnashed at him with their teeth.
007:055 But he, being full of the Holy Spirit, looked up steadfastly  into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing  on the right hand of God,
007:056 and said, "Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of Man  standing at the right hand of God!"
007:057 But they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears,  and rushed at him with one accord.
007:058 They threw him out of the city, and stoned him.  The witnesses placed their garments at the feet of a young  man named Saul.
007:059 They stoned Stephen as he called out, saying, "Lord Jesus,  receive my spirit!"
007:060 He kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, "Lord, don't hold  this sin against them!"  When he had said this, he fell asleep.
007:061 These were those who went up from Tel Melah, Tel Harsha,  Cherub, Addon, and Immer; but they could not show their fathers'  houses, nor their seed, whether they were of Israel:
007:062 The children of Delaiah, the children of Tobiah, the children  of Nekoda, six hundred forty-two.
007:063 Of the priests:  the children of Hobaiah, the children of Hakkoz,  the children of Barzillai, who took a wife of the daughters  of Barzillai the Gileadite, and was called after their name.
007:064 These sought their register [among] those who were reckoned  by genealogy, but it was not found:  therefore were they  deemed polluted and put from the priesthood.
007:065 The governor said to them, that they should not eat of the most  holy things, until there stood up a priest with Urim and Thummim.
007:066 The whole assembly together was forty-two thousand  three hundred sixty,
007:067 besides their male servants and their female servants, of whom  there were seven thousand three hundred thirty-seven: and they  had two hundred forty-five singing men and singing women.
007:068 Their horses were seven hundred thirty-six; their mules,  two hundred forty-five;
007:069 [their] camels, four hundred thirty-five; [their] donkeys,  six thousand seven hundred twenty.
007:070 Some from among the heads of fathers' [houses] gave to the work.  The governor gave to the treasury one thousand darics of gold,  fifty basins, and five hundred thirty priests' garments.
007:071 Some of the heads of fathers' [houses] gave into the treasury  of the work twenty thousand darics of gold, and two thousand  two hundred minas of silver.
007:072 That which the rest of the people gave was twenty thousand  darics of gold, and two thousand minas of silver,  and sixty-seven priests' garments.
007:073 So the priests, and the Levites, and the porters, and the singers,  and some of the people, and the Nethinim, and all Israel,  lived in their cities.  When the seventh month was come,  the children of Israel were in their cities.
007:074 one golden ladle of ten shekels, full of incense;
007:075 one young bull, one ram, one male lamb a year old,  for a burnt offering;
007:076 one male goat for a sin offering;
007:077 and for the sacrifice of peace offerings, two oxen,  five rams, five male goats, and five male lambs a year old.  This was the offering of Pagiel the son of Ochran.
007:078 On the twelfth day Ahira the son of Enan, prince of the  children of Naphtali
007:079 gave his offering:  one silver platter, the weight of which was  one hundred thirty shekels, one silver bowl of seventy shekels,  after the shekel of the sanctuary; both of them full of fine  flour mixed with oil for a meal offering;
007:080 one golden spoon of ten shekels, full of incense;
007:081 one young bull, one ram, one male lamb a year old,  for a burnt offering;
007:082 one male goat for a sin offering;
007:083 and for the sacrifice of peace offerings, two oxen,  five rams, five male goats, and five male lambs a year old.  This was the offering of Ahira the son of Enan.
007:084 This was the dedication of the altar, on the day when it  was anointed, by the princes of Israel:  twelve silver platters,  twelve silver bowls, twelve golden ladles;
007:085 each silver platter weighing one hundred thirty shekels,  and each bowl seventy; all the silver of the vessels two thousand  four hundred shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary;
007:086 the twelve golden ladles, full of incense, weighing ten  shekels apiece, after the shekel of the sanctuary;  all the gold of the ladles weighed one hundred twenty shekels;
007:087 all the oxen for the burnt offering twelve bulls, the rams twelve,  the male lambs a year old twelve, and their meal offering;  and the male goats for a sin offering twelve;
007:088 and all the oxen for the sacrifice of peace offerings  twenty-four bulls, the rams sixty, the male goats sixty,  the male lambs a year old sixty.  This was the dedication  of the altar, after it was anointed.
007:089 When Moses went into the Tent of Meeting to speak with Yahweh,  he heard his voice speaking to him from above the mercy seat that  was on the ark of the Testimony, from between the two cherubim:  and he spoke to him.
010:033 partly, being exposed to both reproaches and oppressions;  and partly, becoming partakers with those who were treated so.
010:034 For you both had compassion on me in my chains, and joyfully  accepted the plundering of your possessions, knowing that you  have for yourselves a better possession and an enduring one  in the heavens.
010:035 Therefore don't throw away your boldness, which has a great reward.
010:036 For you need endurance so that, having done the will of God,  you may receive the promise.
015:034 Wake up righteously, and don't sin, for some have no knowledge  of God.  I say this to your shame.
015:035 But someone will say, "How are the dead raised?" and, "With what  kind of body do they come?"
015:036 You foolish one, that which you yourself sow is not made alive  unless it dies.
015:037 That which you sow, you don't sow the body that will be,  but a bare grain, maybe of wheat, or of some other kind.
015:038 But God gives it a body even as it pleased him, and to each  seed a body of its own.
015:039 All flesh is not the same flesh, but there is one flesh of men,  another flesh of animals, another of fish, and another of birds.
015:040 There are also celestial bodies, and terrestrial bodies;  but the glory of the celestial differs from that of the terrestrial.
015:041 There is one glory of the sun, another glory of the moon,  and another glory of the stars; for one star differs from  another star in glory.
016:037 But Paul said to them, "They have beaten us publicly,  without a trial, men who are Romans, and have cast us into prison!  Do they now release us secretly?  No, most certainly,  but let them come themselves and bring us out!"
016:038 The sergeants reported these words to the magistrates,  and they were afraid when they heard that they were Romans,
016:039 and they came and begged them.  When they had brought them out,  they asked them to depart from the city.
016:040 They went out of the prison, and entered into Lydia's house.  When they had seen the brothers, they encouraged them, and departed.
016:041 They shall burn your houses with fire, and execute judgments  on you in the sight of many women; and I will cause you  to cease from playing the prostitute, and you shall also give  no hire any more.
016:042 So will I cause my wrath toward you to rest, and my jealousy  shall depart from you, and I will be quiet, and will be  no more angry.
016:043 Because you have not remembered the days of your youth,  but have raged against me in all these things; therefore, behold,  I also will bring your way on your head, says the Lord Yahweh:  and you shall not commit this lewdness with all your abominations.
016:044 Behold, everyone who uses proverbs shall use [this] proverb  against you, saying, As is the mother, so is her daughter.
016:045 You are the daughter of your mother, who loathes her husband  and her children; and you are the sister of your sisters,  who loathed their husbands and their children:  your mother was a Hittite, and your father an Amorite.
016:046 Your elder sister is Samaria, who dwells at your left hand,  she and her daughters; and your younger sister, who dwells  at your right hand, is Sodom and her daughters.
016:047 Yet have you not walked in their ways, nor done after  their abominations; but, as [if that were] a very little [thing],  you were more corrupt than they in all your ways.
016:048 As I live, says the Lord Yahweh, Sodom your sister has not done,  she nor her daughters, as you have done, you and your daughters.
016:049 Behold, this was the iniquity of your sister Sodom:  pride, fullness of bread, and prosperous ease was in her  and in her daughters; neither did she strengthen the hand  of the poor and needy.
016:050 They were haughty, and committed abomination before me:  therefore I took them away as I saw [good].
020:028 Take heed, therefore, to yourselves, and to all the flock,  in which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to shepherd  the assembly of the Lord and{TR, NU omit "the Lord and"} God  which he purchased with his own blood.
020:029 For I know that after my departure, vicious wolves will enter  in among you, not sparing the flock.
022:034 He said, "I tell you, Peter, the rooster will by no means crow  today until you deny that you know me three times."
022:035 He said to them, "When I sent you out without purse, and wallet,  and shoes, did you lack anything?"  They said, "Nothing."
022:036 Then he said to them, "But now, whoever has a purse,  let him take it, and likewise a wallet.  Whoever has none,  let him sell his cloak, and buy a sword.
022:037 For I tell you that this which is written must still be fulfilled  in me:  'He was counted with the lawless.'{Isaiah 53:12} For  that which concerns me has an end."
022:038 They said, "Lord, behold, here are two swords."  He said to them,  "That is enough."
022:039 He came out, and went, as his custom was, to the Mount of Olives.  His disciples also followed him.
022:040 When he was at the place, he said to them, "Pray that you  don't enter into temptation."
022:041 He was withdrawn from them about a stone's throw, and he knelt  down and prayed,
026:047 While he was still speaking, behold, Judas, one of the twelve,  came, and with him a great multitude with swords and clubs,  from the chief priest and elders of the people.
026:048 Now he who betrayed him gave them a sign, saying, "Whoever I kiss,  he is the one.  Seize him."
026:049 Immediately he came to Jesus, and said, "Hail, Rabbi!"  and kissed him.
026:050 Jesus said to him, "Friend, why are you here?"  Then they came  and laid hands on Jesus, and took him.
026:051 Behold, one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand,  and drew his sword, and struck the servant of the high priest,  and struck off his ear.
026:052 Then Jesus said to him, "Put your sword back into its place,  for all those who take the sword will die by the sword.
026:053 Or do you think that I couldn't ask my Father, and he would  even now send me more than twelve legions of angels?
026:054 How then would the Scriptures be fulfilled that it must be so?"
026:055 In that hour Jesus said to the multitudes, "Have you come  out as against a robber with swords and clubs to seize me?  I sat daily in the temple teaching, and you didn't arrest me.
026:056 But all this has happened, that the Scriptures of the prophets  might be fulfilled."  Then all the disciples left him, and fled.
026:057 Those who had taken Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest,  where the scribes and the elders were gathered together.
026:058 But Peter followed him from a distance, to the court of  the high priest, and entered in and sat with the officers,  to see the end.
026:059 Now the chief priests, the elders, and the whole council  sought false testimony against Jesus, that they might put  him to death;
026:060 and they found none.  Even though many false witnesses came forward,  they found none.  But at last two false witnesses came forward,
026:061 and said, "This man said, 'I am able to destroy the temple of God,  and to build it in three days.'"
026:062 The high priest stood up, and said to him, "Have you no answer?  What is this that these testify against you?"
026:063 But Jesus held his peace.  The high priest answered him,  "I adjure you by the living God, that you tell us whether  you are the Christ, the Son of God."
026:064 Jesus said to him, "You have said it.  Nevertheless, I tell you,  after this you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right  hand of Power, and coming on the clouds of the sky."
026:065 Then the high priest tore his clothing, saying, "He has  spoken blasphemy!  Why do we need any more witnesses?  Behold, now you have heard his blasphemy.
032:036 Now therefore thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel,  concerning this city, about which you say, It is given into  the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword, and by the famine,  and by the pestilence:
032:037 Behold, I will gather them out of all the countries,  where I have driven them in my anger, and in my wrath, and in  great indignation; and I will bring them again to this place,  and I will cause them to dwell safely:
032:038 and they shall be my people, and I will be their God:
032:039 and I will give them one heart and one way, that they  may fear me forever, for the good of them, and of their  children after them:
032:040 and I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I  will not turn away from following them, to do them good;  and I will put my fear in their hearts, that they may not  depart from me.
032:041 Yes, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will plant  them in this land assuredly with my whole heart and with  my whole soul.
032:042 For thus says Yahweh:  Like as I have brought all this great evil  on this people, so will I bring on them all the good that I  have promised them.
033:024 Son of man, they who inhabit those waste places in the land of  Israel speak, saying, Abraham was one, and he inherited the land:  but we are many; the land is given us for inheritance.
033:025 Therefore tell them, Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  You eat with  the blood, and lift up your eyes to your idols, and shed blood:  and shall you possess the land?
033:026 You stand on your sword, you work abomination, and you defile  everyone his neighbor's wife:  and shall you possess the land?
033:027 Thus shall you tell them, Thus says the Lord Yahweh:  As I live,  surely those who are in the waste places shall fall by the sword;  and him who is in the open field will I give to the animals  to be devoured; and those who are in the strongholds and in  the caves shall die of the pestilence.
033:028 I will make the land a desolation and an astonishment;  and the pride of her power shall cease; and the mountains  of Israel shall be desolate, so that none shall pass through.
033:029 Then shall they know that I am Yahweh, when I have made  the land a desolation and an astonishment, because of all  their abominations which they have committed.
033:030 As for you, son of man, the children of your people talk  of you by the walls and in the doors of the houses, and speak  one to another, everyone to his brother, saying, Please come  and hear what is the word that comes forth from Yahweh.
033:031 They come to you as the people comes, and they sit before you  as my people, and they hear your words, but don't do them;  for with their mouth they show much love, but their heart  goes after their gain.
033:032 Behold, you are to them as a very lovely song of one who has  a pleasant voice, and can play well on an instrument;  for they hear your words, but they don't do them.
033:033 When this comes to pass, (behold, it comes), then shall they  know that a prophet has been among them.
033:034 They traveled from Jotbathah, and encamped in Abronah.
033:035 They traveled from Abronah, and encamped in Ezion Geber.
033:036 They traveled from Ezion Geber, and encamped in the wilderness  of Zin (the same is Kadesh).
033:037 They traveled from Kadesh, and encamped in Mount Hor,  in the edge of the land of Edom.
033:038 Aaron the priest went up into Mount Hor at the commandment  of Yahweh, and died there, in the fortieth year after  the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt,  in the fifth month, on the first day of the month.
033:039 Aaron was one hundred twenty-three years old when he died  in Mount Hor.
033:040 The Canaanite, the king of Arad, who lived in the South in the land  of Canaan, heard of the coming of the children of Israel.
033:041 They traveled from Mount Hor, and encamped in Zalmonah.
033:042 They traveled from Zalmonah, and encamped in Punon.
033:043 They traveled from Punon, and encamped in Oboth.
033:044 They traveled from Oboth, and encamped in Iye Abarim,  in the border of Moab.
033:045 They traveled from Iyim, and encamped in Dibon Gad.
033:046 They traveled from Dibon Gad, and encamped in Almon Diblathaim.
033:047 They traveled from Almon Diblathaim, and encamped in the mountains  of Abarim, before Nebo.
033:048 They traveled from the mountains of Abarim, and encamped  in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho.
033:049 They encamped by the Jordan, from Beth Jeshimoth even to  Abel Shittim in the plains of Moab.
033:050 Yahweh spoke to Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan  at Jericho, saying,
033:051 Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them, When you pass  over the Jordan into the land of Canaan,
033:052 then you shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land  from before you, and destroy all their figured [stones],  and destroy all their molten images, and demolish all  their high places:
033:053 and you shall take possession of the land, and dwell therein;  for to you have I given the land to possess it.
033:054 You shall inherit the land by lot according to your families;  to the more you shall give the more inheritance,  and to the fewer you shall give the less inheritance:  wherever the lot falls to any man, that shall be his;  according to the tribes of your fathers shall you inherit.
033:055 But if you will not drive out the inhabitants of the land  from before you, then shall those who you let remain of them  be as pricks in your eyes, and as thorns in your sides,  and they shall vex you in the land in which you dwell.
033:056 It shall happen that as I thought to do to them, so will I  do to you.
002:035 until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet."'{Psalm 110:1}
002:036 "Let all the house of Israel therefore know certainly that God has  made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you crucified."
002:037 Now when they heard this, they were cut to the heart,  and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, "Brothers,  what shall we do?"
005:033 Nevertheless each of you must also love his own wife even as himself;  and let the wife see that she respects her husband.
028:044 He shall lend to you, and you shall not lend to him:  he shall be the head, and you shall be the tail.
028:045 All these curses shall come on you, and shall pursue you,  and overtake you, until you are destroyed; because you didn't  listen to the voice of Yahweh your God, to keep his commandments  and his statutes which he commanded you:
028:046 and they shall be on you for a sign and for a wonder,  and on your seed forever.
028:047 Because you didn't serve Yahweh your God with joyfulness,  and with gladness of heart, by reason of the abundance  of all things;
028:048 therefore shall you serve your enemies whom Yahweh shall send  against you, in hunger, and in thirst, and in nakedness,  and in want of all things:  and he shall put a yoke of iron  on your neck, until he have destroyed you.
028:049 Yahweh will bring a nation against you from far, from the end  of the earth, as the eagle flies; a nation whose language  you shall not understand;
028:050 a nation of fierce facial expressions, that shall not regard  the person of the old, nor show favor to the young,
028:051 and shall eat the fruit of your livestock, and the fruit of  your ground, until you are destroyed; that also shall not leave  you grain, new wine, or oil, the increase of your livestock,  or the young of your flock, until they have caused you to perish.
028:052 They shall besiege you in all your gates, until your high  and fortified walls come down, in which you trusted,  throughout all your land; and they shall besiege you in all  your gates throughout all your land, which Yahweh your God  has given you.
028:053 You shall eat the fruit of your own body, the flesh of your sons  and of your daughters, whom Yahweh your God has given you,  in the siege and in the distress with which your enemies  shall distress you.
028:054 The man who is tender among you, and very delicate, his eye shall  be evil toward his brother, and toward the wife of his bosom,  and toward the remnant of his children whom he has remaining;
028:055 so that he will not give to any of them of the flesh of his  children whom he shall eat, because he has nothing left him,  in the siege and in the distress with which your enemy shall  distress you in all your gates.
028:056 The tender and delicate woman among you, who would not adventure  to set the sole of her foot on the ground for delicateness  and tenderness, her eye shall be evil toward the husband  of her bosom, and toward her son, and toward her daughter,
028:057 and toward her young one who comes out from between her feet,  and toward her children whom she shall bear; for she shall  eat them for want of all things secretly, in the siege  and in the distress with which your enemy shall distress you  in your gates.
028:058 If you will not observe to do all the words of this law that  are written in this book, that you may fear this glorious  and fearful name, YAHWEH YOUR GOD;
028:059 then Yahweh will make your plagues wonderful, and the plagues  of your seed, even great plagues, and of long continuance,  and sore sicknesses, and of long continuance.
028:060 He will bring on you again all the diseases of Egypt,  which you were afraid of; and they shall cleave to you.
028:061 Also every sickness, and every plague, which is not written  in the book of this law, them will Yahweh bring on you,  until you are destroyed.
028:062 You shall be left few in number, whereas you were as the stars  of the sky for multitude; because you didn't listen to the voice  of Yahweh your God.
028:063 It shall happen that as Yahweh rejoiced over you to do you good,  and to multiply you, so Yahweh will rejoice over you to cause  you to perish, and to destroy you; and you shall be plucked  from off the land where you go in to possess it.
028:064 Yahweh will scatter you among all peoples, from the one  end of the earth even to the other end of the earth;  and there you shall serve other gods, which you have not known,  you nor your fathers, even wood and stone.
028:065 Among these nations shall you find no ease, and there  shall be no rest for the sole of your foot:  but Yahweh  will give you there a trembling heart, and failing of eyes,  and pining of soul;
028:066 and your life shall hang in doubt before you; and you shall  fear night and day, and shall have no assurance of your life.
028:067 In the morning you shall say, Would it were even! and at even  you shall say, Would it were morning! for the fear of your  heart which you shall fear, and for the sight of your eyes  which you shall see.
028:068 Yahweh will bring you into Egypt again with ships, by the way  of which I said to you, You shall see it no more again:  and there you shall sell yourselves to your enemies for  bondservants and for bondmaids, and no man shall buy you.
032:043 Fields shall be bought in this land, about which you say,  It is desolate, without man or animal; it is given into the hand  of the Chaldeans.
032:044 Men shall buy fields for money, and subscribe the deeds,  and seal them, and call witnesses, in the land of Benjamin,  and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah,  and in the cities of the hill country, and in the cities  of the lowland, and in the cities of the South:  for I will cause their captivity to return, says Yahweh.
032:045 Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all Israel;
032:046 He said to them, Set your heart to all the words which I  testify to you this day, which you shall command your children  to observe to do, [even] all the words of this law.
032:047 For it is no vain thing for you; because it is your life,  and through this thing you shall prolong your days in the land,  where you go over the Jordan to possess it.
032:048 Yahweh spoke to Moses that same day, saying,
032:049 Go up into this mountain of Abarim, to Mount Nebo,  which is in the land of Moab, that is over against Jericho;  and see the land of Canaan, which I give to the children  of Israel for a possession;
032:050 and die on the mountain where you go up, and be gathered  to your people, as Aaron your brother died on Mount Hor,  and was gathered to his people:
032:051 because you trespassed against me in the midst of the children  of Israel at the waters of Meribah of Kadesh, in the wilderness  of Zin; because you didn't sanctify me in the midst of  the children of Israel.
032:052 For you shall see the land before you; but you shall not go  there into the land which I give the children of Israel.
010:037 "In a very little while, he who comes will come, and will not wait.
010:038 But the righteous will live by faith.  If he shrinks back,  my soul has no pleasure in him."{Habakkuk 2:3-4}
010:039 But we are not of those who shrink back to destruction,  but of those who have faith to the saving of the soul.
010:040 God raised him up the third day, and gave him to be revealed,
010:041 not to all the people, but to witnesses who were chosen  before by God, to us, who ate and drank with him after he rose  from the dead.
010:042 He charged us to preach to the people and to testify that this  is he who is appointed by God as the Judge of the living  and the dead.
010:043 All the prophets testify about him, that through his name  everyone who believes in him will receive remission of sins."
015:042 So also is the resurrection of the dead.  It is sown in corruption;  it is raised in incorruption.
015:043 It is sown in dishonor; it is raised in glory.  It is sown  in weakness; it is raised in power.
015:044 It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body.  There is a natural body and there is also a spiritual body.
015:045 So also it is written, "The first man, Adam, became a living  soul."{Genesis 2:7} The last Adam became a life-giving spirit.
015:046 However that which is spiritual isn't first, but that which  is natural, then that which is spiritual.
015:047 The first man is of the earth, made of dust.  The second man  is the Lord from heaven.
015:048 As is the one made of dust, such are those who are also made of dust;  and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.
015:049 As we have borne the image of those made of dust, let's{NU, TR read  "we will" instead of "let's"} also bear the image of the heavenly.
015:050 Now I say this, brothers,{The word for "brothers" here and where  context allows may also be correctly translated "brothers  and sisters" or "siblings."} that flesh and blood can't inherit  the Kingdom of God; neither does corruption inherit incorruption.
015:051 Behold, I tell you a mystery.  We will not all sleep, but we  will all be changed,
015:052 in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet.  For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised  incorruptible, and we will be changed.
015:053 For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal  must put on immortality.
015:054 But when this corruptible will have put on incorruption,  and this mortal will have put on immortality, then what is written  will happen:  "Death is swallowed up in victory."{Isaiah 25:8}
015:055 "Death, where is your sting?  Hades{or, Hell}, where is  your victory?"{Hosea 13:14}
015:056 The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law.
015:057 But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our  Lord Jesus Christ.
015:058 Therefore, my beloved brothers, be steadfast, immovable,  always abounding in the Lord's work, because you know that  your labor is not in vain in the Lord.
015:059 and Maarath, and Beth Anoth, and Eltekon; six cities  with their villages.
015:060 Kiriath Baal (the same is Kiriath Jearim), and Rabbah;  two cities with their villages.
015:061 In the wilderness, Beth Arabah, Middin, and Secacah,
015:062 and Nibshan, and the City of Salt, and En Gedi; six cities  with their villages.
015:063 As for the Jebusites, the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the children  of Judah couldn't drive them out:  but the Jebusites dwell  with the children of Judah at Jerusalem to this day.
019:039 But if you seek anything about other matters, it will be settled  in the regular assembly.
019:040 For indeed we are in danger of being accused concerning this  day's riot, there being no cause.  Concerning it, we wouldn't  be able to give an account of this commotion."
019:041 When he had thus spoken, he dismissed the assembly.
019:042 Then because of the Jews' Preparation Day (for the tomb was  near at hand) they laid Jesus there.
019:043 For the days will come on you, when your enemies will throw up  a barricade against you, surround you, hem you in on every side,
019:044 and will dash you and your children within you to the ground.  They will not leave in you one stone on another, because you  didn't know the time of your visitation."
019:045 He entered into the temple, and began to drive out those who  bought and sold in it,
019:046 saying to them, "It is written, 'My house is a house  of prayer,'{Isaiah 56:7} but you have made it a 'den  of robbers'!"{Jeremiah 7:11}
019:047 He was teaching daily in the temple, but the chief priests  and the scribes and the leading men among the people sought  to destroy him.
019:048 They couldn't find what they might do, for all the people hung  on to every word that he said.
019:049 So they made an end of distributing the land for inheritance  by the borders of it; and the children of Israel gave an  inheritance to Joshua the son of Nun in the midst of them:
019:050 according to the commandment of Yahweh they gave him the city  which he asked, even Timnathserah in the hill country of Ephraim;  and he built the city, and lived therein.
019:051 These are the inheritances, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua  the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers' [houses] of the tribes  of the children of Israel, distributed for inheritance by lot  in Shiloh before Yahweh, at the door of the tent of meeting.  So they made an end of dividing the land.
021:037 As Paul was about to be brought into the barracks,  he asked the commanding officer, "May I speak to you?"  He said, "Do you know Greek?
021:038 Aren't you then the Egyptian, who before these days stirred up  to sedition and led out into the wilderness the four thousand  men of the Assassins?"
021:039 But Paul said, "I am a Jew, from Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen  of no insignificant city.  I beg you, allow me to speak  to the people."
021:040 When he had given him permission, Paul, standing on the stairs,  beckoned with his hand to the people.  When there was a  great silence, he spoke to them in the Hebrew language, saying,
021:041 They told him, "He will miserably destroy those miserable men,  and will lease out the vineyard to other farmers, who will  give him the fruit in its season."
021:042 Jesus said to them, "Did you never read in the Scriptures, 'The  stone which the builders rejected, the same was made  the head of the corner.  This was from the Lord.  It is marvelous in our eyes?'{Psalm 118:22-23}
021:043 "Therefore I tell you, the Kingdom of God will be taken away  from you, and will be given to a nation bringing forth its fruit.
021:044 He who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces, but on  whoever it will fall, it will scatter him as dust."
021:045 When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables,  they perceived that he spoke about them.
006:031 Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness.  As it is written,  'He gave them bread out of heaven{Greek and Hebrew use the same  word for "heaven", "the heavens", "the sky", and "the air".}  to eat.'"{Exodus 16:4; Nehemiah 9:15; Psalm 78:24-25}
006:032 Jesus therefore said to them, "Most certainly, I tell you,  it wasn't Moses who gave you the bread out of heaven,  but my Father gives you the true bread out of heaven.
006:033 For the bread of God is that which comes down out of heaven,  and gives life to the world."
006:034 They said therefore to him, "Lord, always give us this bread."
006:035 Jesus said to them, "I am the bread of life.  He who comes  to me will not be hungry, and he who believes in me will  never be thirsty.
006:036 But I told you that you have seen me, and yet you don't believe.
006:037 All those who the Father gives me will come to me.  Him who comes to me I will in no way throw out.
006:038 For I have come down from heaven, not to do my own will,  but the will of him who sent me.
006:039 This is the will of my Father who sent me, that of all he has  given to me I should lose nothing, but should raise him up  at the last day.
006:040 This is the will of the one who sent me, that everyone who sees  the Son, and believes in him, should have eternal life;  and I will raise him up at the last day."
009:036 Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha,  which when translated, means Dorcas.{"Dorcas" is Greek  for "Gazelle."} This woman was full of good works and acts  of mercy which she did.
009:037 It happened in those days that she fell sick, and died.  When they had washed her, they laid her in an upper chamber.
009:038 As Lydda was near Joppa, the disciples, hearing that Peter was there,  sent two men{Reading from NU, TR; MT omits "two men"} to him,  imploring him not to delay in coming to them.
009:039 Peter got up and went with them.  When he had come, they brought  him into the upper chamber.  All the widows stood by him weeping,  and showing the coats and garments which Dorcas had made  while she was with them.
009:040 Peter put them all out, and kneeled down and prayed.  Turning to the body, he said, "Tabitha, get up!"  She opened her eyes, and when she saw Peter, she sat up.
009:041 He gave her his hand, and raised her up.  Calling the saints  and widows, he presented her alive.
009:042 And it became known throughout all Joppa, and many believed  in the Lord.
009:043 It happened, that he stayed many days in Joppa with one Simon,  a tanner.
009:044 "Let these words sink into your ears, for the Son of Man  will be delivered up into the hands of men."
009:045 But they didn't understand this saying.  It was concealed from them,  that they should not perceive it, and they were afraid to ask  him about this saying.
009:046 There arose an argument among them about which of them  was the greatest.
009:047 Jesus, perceiving the reasoning of their hearts, took a little child,  and set him by his side,
009:048 and said to them, "Whoever receives this little child in my name  receives me.  Whoever receives me receives him who sent me.  For whoever is least among you all, this one will be great."
009:049 John answered, "Master, we saw someone casting out demons  in your name, and we forbade him, because he doesn't  follow with us."
009:050 Jesus said to him, "Don't forbid him, for he who is not against  us is for us."
009:051 It came to pass, when the days were near that he should be  taken up, he intently set his face to go to Jerusalem,
009:052 and sent messengers before his face.  They went, and entered  into a village of the Samaritans, so as to prepare for him.
009:053 They didn't receive him, because he was traveling with his face  set towards Jerusalem.
009:054 When his disciples, James and John, saw this, they said, "Lord,  do you want us to command fire to come down from the sky,  and destroy them, just as Elijah did?"
009:055 But he turned and rebuked them, "You don't know of what kind  of spirit you are.
009:056 For the Son of Man didn't come to destroy men's lives,  but to save them."  They went to another village.
009:057 As they went on the way, a certain man said to him, "I want  to follow you wherever you go, Lord."
020:030 Men will arise from among your own selves, speaking perverse things,  to draw away the disciples after them.
020:031 Therefore watch, remembering that for a period of three years  I didn't cease to admonish everyone night and day with tears.
020:032 Now, brothers,{The word for "brothers" here and where the context  allows may also be correctly translated "brothers and sisters"  or "siblings."} I entrust you to God, and to the word of his grace,  which is able to build up, and to give you the inheritance  among all those who are sanctified.
020:033 I coveted no one's silver, or gold, or clothing.
020:034 You yourselves know that these hands served my necessities,  and those who were with me.
020:035 In all things I gave you an example, that so laboring you ought  to help the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus,  that he himself said, 'It is more blessed to give than to receive.'"
020:036 When he had spoken these things, he knelt down and prayed  with them all.
020:037 They all wept a lot, and fell on Paul's neck and kissed him,
020:038 sorrowing most of all because of the word which he had spoken,  that they should see his face no more.  And they accompanied  him to the ship.
020:039 Some of the scribes answered, "Teacher, you speak well."
020:040 They didn't dare to ask him any more questions.
020:041 He said to them, "Why do they say that the Christ is David's son?
020:042 David himself says in the book of Psalms, 'The Lord said  to my Lord, "Sit at my right hand,
020:043 until I make your enemies the footstool of your feet."'{Psalm 110:1}
020:044 "David therefore calls him Lord, so how is he his son?"
020:045 In the hearing of all the people, he said to his disciples,
020:046 "Beware of the scribes, who like to walk in long robes, and love  greetings in the marketplaces, the best seats in the synagogues,  and the best places at feasts;
020:047 who devour widows' houses, and for a pretense make long prayers:  these will receive greater condemnation."
020:048 All flesh shall see that I, Yahweh, have kindled it;  it shall not be quenched.
017:028 'For in him we live, and move, and have our being.'  As some  of your own poets have said, 'For we are also his offspring.'
017:029 Being then the offspring of God, we ought not to think  that the Divine Nature is like gold, or silver, or stone,  engraved by art and design of man.
017:030 The times of ignorance therefore God overlooked.  But now he commands that all people everywhere should repent,
017:031 because he has appointed a day in which he will judge  the world in righteousness by the man whom he has ordained;  of which he has given assurance to all men, in that he has  raised him from the dead."
017:032 Now when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked;  but others said, "We want to hear you again concerning this."
017:033 Thus Paul went out from among them.
017:034 But certain men joined with him, and believed, among whom  also was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris,  and others with them.
017:035 There will be two grinding grain together.  One will be taken,  and the other will be left."
017:036 {Some Greek manuscripts add:  "Two will be in the field:  the one taken, and the other left."}
017:037 They answering, asked him, "Where, Lord?"  He said to them,  "Where the body is, there will the vultures also  be gathered together."
017:038 and the covenant that I have made with you you shall not forget;  neither shall you fear other gods:
017:039 but Yahweh your God shall you fear; and he will deliver you  out of the hand of all your enemies.
017:040 However they did not listen, but they did after their former manner.
017:041 So these nations feared Yahweh, and served their engraved images;  their children likewise, and their children's children,  as did their fathers, so do they to this day.
017:042 When the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he disdained him;  for he was but a youth, and ruddy, and withal of a fair face.
017:043 The Philistine said to David, Am I a dog, that you come to me  with sticks?  The Philistine cursed David by his gods.
017:044 The Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give  your flesh to the birds of the sky, and to the animals  of the field.
017:045 Then said David to the Philistine, You come to me with a sword,  and with a spear, and with a javelin:  but I come to you in  the name of Yahweh of Armies, the God of the armies of Israel,  whom you have defied.
017:046 This day will Yahweh deliver you into my hand; and I will  strike you, and take your head from off you; and I will give  the dead bodies of the army of the Philistines this day  to the birds of the sky, and to the wild animals of the earth;  that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel,
017:047 and that all this assembly may know that Yahweh doesn't  save with sword and spear:  for the battle is Yahweh's,  and he will give you into our hand.
017:048 It happened, when the Philistine arose, and came and drew near  to meet David, that David hurried, and ran toward the army  to meet the Philistine.
017:049 David put his hand in his bag, and took there a stone,  and slang it, and struck the Philistine in his forehead;  and the stone sank into his forehead, and he fell on his face  to the earth.
017:050 So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and  with a stone, and struck the Philistine, and killed him;  but there was no sword in the hand of David.
017:051 Then David ran, and stood over the Philistine, and took his sword,  and drew it out of the sheath of it, and killed him,  and cut off his head therewith.  When the Philistines saw  that their champion was dead, they fled.
017:052 The men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and pursued  the Philistines, until you come to Gai, and to the gates of Ekron.  The wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim,  even to Gath, and to Ekron.
017:053 The children of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines,  and they plundered their camp.
017:054 David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to Jerusalem;  but he put his armor in his tent.
017:055 When Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said to Abner,  the captain of the army, Abner, whose son is this youth?  Abner said, As your soul lives, O king, I can't tell.
017:056 The king said, "Inquire whose son the young man is!"
017:057 As David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner  took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of  the Philistine in his hand.
017:058 Saul said to him, Whose son are you, you young man?  David answered, I am the son of your servant Jesse the Bethlehemite.
022:042 saying, "Father, if you are willing, remove this cup from me.  Nevertheless, not my will, but yours, be done."
022:043 An angel from heaven appeared to him, strengthening him.
022:044 Being in agony he prayed more earnestly.  His sweat became  like great drops of blood falling down on the ground.
022:045 When he rose up from his prayer, he came to the disciples,  and found them sleeping because of grief,
022:046 and said to them, "Why do you sleep?  Rise and pray that you  may not enter into temptation."
022:047 While he was still speaking, behold, a multitude, and he who  was called Judas, one of the twelve, was leading them.  He came near to Jesus to kiss him.
022:048 But Jesus said to him, "Judas, do you betray the Son of Man  with a kiss?"
022:049 When those who were around him saw what was about to happen,  they said to him, "Lord, shall we strike with the sword?"
022:050 A certain one of them struck the servant of the high priest,  and cut off his right ear.
022:051 But Jesus answered, "Let me at least do this"--and he touched  his ear, and healed him.
002:038 Peter said to them, "Repent, and be baptized, every one of you,  in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of sins,  and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.
002:039 For to you is the promise, and to your children, and to all  who are far off, even as many as the Lord our God will  call to himself."
002:040 With many other words he testified, and exhorted them, saying,  "Save yourselves from this crooked generation!"
002:041 Then those who gladly received his word were baptized.  There were added that day about three thousand souls.
002:042 They continued steadfastly in the apostles' teaching and fellowship,  in the breaking of bread, and prayer.
002:043 Fear came on every soul, and many wonders and signs were done  through the apostles.
002:044 All who believed were together, and had all things in common.
002:045 They sold their possessions and goods, and distributed them  to all, according as anyone had need.
002:046 Day by day, continuing steadfastly with one accord in the temple,  and breaking bread at home, they took their food with gladness  and singleness of heart,
008:037 No, in all these things, we are more than conquerors through  him who loved us.
008:038 For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels,  nor principalities, nor things present, nor things  to come, nor powers,
008:039 nor height, nor depth, nor any other created thing,  will be able to separate us from the love of God, which is  in Christ Jesus our Lord.
008:040 But Philip was found at Azotus.  Passing through, he preached  the Good News to all the cities, until he came to Caesarea.
008:041 You do the works of your father."  They said to him, "We were  not born of sexual immorality.  We have one Father, God."
008:042 Therefore Jesus said to them, "If God were your father,  you would love me, for I came out and have come from God.  For I haven't come of myself, but he sent me.
008:043 Why don't you understand my speech?  Because you can't  hear my word.
008:044 You are of your father, the devil, and you want to do the desires  of your father.  He was a murderer from the beginning,  and doesn't stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him.  When he speaks a lie, he speaks on his own; for he is a liar,  and the father of it.
008:045 But because I tell the truth, you don't believe me.
008:046 Which of you convicts me of sin?  If I tell the truth,  why do you not believe me?
008:047 He who is of God hears the words of God.  For this cause you  don't hear, because you are not of God."
008:048 Then the Jews answered him, "Don't we say well that you are  a Samaritan, and have a demon?"
008:049 Jesus answered, "I don't have a demon, but I honor my Father,  and you dishonor me.
008:050 But I don't seek my own glory.  There is one who seeks and judges.
008:051 Most certainly, I tell you, if a person keeps my word,  he will never see death."
008:052 Then the Jews said to him, "Now we know that you have a demon.  Abraham died, and the prophets; and you say, 'If a man keeps  my word, he will never taste of death.'
008:053 Are you greater than our father, Abraham, who died?  The prophets died.  Who do you make yourself out to be?"
008:054 Jesus answered, "If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing.  It is my Father who glorifies me, of whom you say that  he is our God.
008:055 You have not known him, but I know him.  If I said, 'I don't  know him,' I would be like you, a liar.  But I know him,  and keep his word.
008:056 Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day.  He saw it,  and was glad."
008:057 The Jews therefore said to him, "You are not yet fifty years old,  and have you seen Abraham?"
008:058 Jesus said to them, "Most certainly, I tell you, before Abraham  came into existence, I AM."
008:059 Therefore they took up stones to throw at him, but Jesus was hidden,  and went out of the temple, having gone through the midst  of them, and so passed by.
008:060 that all the peoples of the earth may know that Yahweh, he is God;  there is none else.
008:061 Let your heart therefore be perfect with Yahweh our God,  to walk in his statutes, and to keep his commandments,  as at this day.
008:062 The king, and all Israel with him, offered sacrifice before Yahweh.
008:063 Solomon offered for the sacrifice of peace offerings,  which he offered to Yahweh, two and twenty thousand oxen,  and one hundred twenty thousand sheep.  So the king and all  the children of Israel dedicated the house of Yahweh.
008:064 The same day did the king make the middle of the court holy  that was before the house of Yahweh; for there he offered  the burnt offering, and the meal offering, and the fat  of the peace offerings, because the bronze altar that was  before Yahweh was too little to receive the burnt offering,  and the meal offering, and the fat of the peace offerings.
008:065 So Solomon held the feast at that time, and all Israel with him,  a great assembly, from the entrance of Hamath to the brook  of Egypt, before Yahweh our God, seven days and seven days,  even fourteen days.
008:066 On the eighth day he sent the people away; and they blessed  the king, and went to their tents joyful and glad of heart  for all the goodness that Yahweh had shown to David his servant,  and to Israel his people.
018:034 Jesus answered him, "Do you say this by yourself, or did others  tell you about me?"
018:035 Pilate answered, "I'm not a Jew, am I?  Your own nation and  the chief priests delivered you to me.  What have you done?"
018:036 Jesus answered, "My Kingdom is not of this world.  If my Kingdom were of this world, then my servants  would fight, that I wouldn't be delivered to the Jews.  But now my Kingdom is not from here."
018:037 Pilate therefore said to him, "Are you a king then?"  Jesus answered, "You say that I am a king.  For this  reason I have been born, and for this reason I have come  into the world, that I should testify to the truth.  Everyone who is of the truth listens to my voice."
018:038 Pilate said to him, "What is truth?"  When he had said this,  he went out again to the Jews, and said to them, "I find  no basis for a charge against him.
018:039 But you have a custom, that I should release someone to you  at the Passover.  Therefore do you want me to release to you  the King of the Jews?"
018:040 Then they all shouted again, saying, "Not this man,  but Barabbas!"  Now Barabbas was a robber.
018:041 "What do you want me to do?"  He said, "Lord, that I  may see again."
018:042 Jesus said to him, "Receive your sight.  Your faith has healed you."
018:043 Immediately he received his sight, and followed him, glorifying God.  All the people, when they saw it, praised God.
018:044 As soon as they hear of me they shall obey me.  The foreigners  shall submit themselves to me.
018:045 The foreigners shall fade away, and shall come trembling out  of their close places.
018:046 Yahweh lives; and blessed be my rock.  Exalted be the God  of my salvation,
022:052 Jesus said to the chief priests, captains of the temple,  and elders, who had come against him, "Have you come out  as against a robber, with swords and clubs?
022:053 When I was with you in the temple daily, you didn't stretch  out your hands against me.  But this is your hour,  and the power of darkness."
002:047 praising God, and having favor with all the people.  The Lord  added to the assembly day by day those who were being saved.
002:048 When they saw him, they were astonished, and his mother  said to him, "Son, why have you treated us this way?  Behold, your father and I were anxiously looking for you."
002:049 He said to them, "Why were you looking for me?  Didn't you  know that I must be in my Father's house?"
002:050 They didn't understand the saying which he spoke to them.
002:051 And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth.  He was subject to them, and his mother kept all these sayings  in her heart.
002:052 And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor  with God and men.
002:053 the children of Barkos, the children of Sisera, the children of Temah,
002:054 the children of Neziah, the children of Hatipha.
002:055 The children of Solomon's servants:  the children of Sotai,  the children of Hassophereth, the children of Peruda,
006:041 The Jews therefore murmured concerning him, because he said,  "I am the bread which came down out of heaven."
006:042 They said, "Isn't this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father  and mother we know?  How then does he say, 'I have come  down out of heaven?'"
006:043 Therefore Jesus answered them, "Don't murmur among yourselves.
006:044 No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him,  and I will raise him up in the last day.
006:045 It is written in the prophets, 'They will all be taught by  God.'{Isaiah 54:13} Therefore everyone who hears from the Father,  and has learned, comes to me.
006:046 Not that anyone has seen the Father, except he who is from God.  He has seen the Father.
006:047 Most certainly, I tell you, he who believes in me has eternal life.
006:048 I am the bread of life.
006:049 Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died.
006:050 This is the bread which comes down out of heaven, that anyone  may eat of it and not die.
006:051 I am the living bread which came down out of heaven.  If anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever.  Yes, the bread which I will give for the life of the world  is my flesh."
006:052 The Jews therefore contended with one another, saying, "How can  this man give us his flesh to eat?"
006:053 Jesus therefore said to them, "Most certainly I tell you,  unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood,  you don't have life in yourselves.
006:054 He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life,  and I will raise him up at the last day.
006:055 For my flesh is food indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.
006:056 He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood lives in me,  and I in him.
006:057 As the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father;  so he who feeds on me, he will also live because of me.
006:058 This is the bread which came down out of heaven--not as our  fathers ate the manna, and died.  He who eats this bread  will live forever."
006:059 These things he said in the synagogue, as he taught in Capernaum.
006:060 Therefore many of his disciples, when they heard this, said,  "This is a hard saying!  Who can listen to it?"
006:061 But Jesus knowing in himself that his disciples murmured at this,  said to them, "Does this cause you to stumble?
006:062 Then what if you would see the Son of Man ascending to where  he was before?
006:063 It is the spirit who gives life.  The flesh profits nothing.  The words that I speak to you are spirit, and are life.
006:064 But there are some of you who don't believe."  For Jesus  knew from the beginning who they were who didn't believe,  and who it was who would betray him.
006:065 He said, "For this cause have I said to you that no one can  come to me, unless it is given to him by my Father."
006:066 At this, many of his disciples went back, and walked no  more with him.
006:067 Jesus said therefore to the twelve, "You don't also want  to go away, do you?"
006:068 Simon Peter answered him, "Lord, to whom would we go?  You have the words of eternal life.
006:069 We have come to believe and know that you are the Christ,  the Son of the living God."
006:070 Jesus answered them, "Didn't I choose you, the twelve,  and one of you is a devil?"
006:071 Now he spoke of Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, for it was  he who would betray him, being one of the twelve.
006:072 and out of the tribe of Issachar, Kedesh with its suburbs,  Daberath with its suburbs,
006:073 and Ramoth with its suburbs, and Anem with its suburbs;
006:074 and out of the tribe of Asher, Mashal with its suburbs,  and Abdon with its suburbs,
006:075 and Hukok with its suburbs, and Rehob with its suburbs;
006:076 and out of the tribe of Naphtali, Kedesh in Galilee with its suburbs,  and Hammon with its suburbs, and Kiriathaim with its suburbs.
006:077 To the rest of [the Levites], the sons of Merari, [were given],  out of the tribe of Zebulun, Rimmono with its suburbs,  Tabor with its suburbs;
006:078 and beyond the Jordan at Jericho, on the east side of the Jordan,  [were given them], out of the tribe of Reuben, Bezer in  the wilderness with its suburbs, and Jahzah with its suburbs,
006:079 and Kedemoth with its suburbs, and Mephaath with its suburbs;
006:080 and out of the tribe of Gad, Ramoth in Gilead with its suburbs,  and Mahanaim with its suburbs,
006:081 and Heshbon with its suburbs, and Jazer with its suburbs.
002:056 the children of Jaalah, the children of Darkon,  the children of Giddel,
002:057 the children of Shephatiah, the children of Hattil, the children  of Pochereth Hazzebaim, the children of Ami.
002:058 All the Nethinim, and the children of Solomon's servants,  were three hundred ninety-two.
002:059 These were those who went up from Tel Melah, Tel Harsha,  Cherub, Addan, [and] Immer; but they could not show their fathers'  houses, and their seed, whether they were of Israel:
002:060 the children of Delaiah, the children of Tobiah, the children  of Nekoda, six hundred fifty-two.
002:061 Of the children of the priests:  the children of Habaiah,  the children of Hakkoz, the children of Barzillai,  who took a wife of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite,  and was called after their name.
002:062 These sought their register [among] those who were reckoned  by genealogy, but they were not found:  therefore were they  deemed polluted and put from the priesthood.
002:063 The governor said to them, that they should not eat of the  most holy things, until there stood up a priest with Urim  and with Thummim.
002:064 The whole assembly together was forty-two thousand  three hundred sixty,
002:065 besides their male servants and their female servants,  of whom there were seven thousand three hundred thirty-seven:  and they had two hundred singing men and singing women.
002:066 Their horses were seven hundred thirty-six; their mules,  two hundred forty-five;
002:067 their camels, four hundred thirty-five; [their] donkeys,  six thousand seven hundred and twenty.
002:068 Some of the heads of fathers' [houses], when they came to  the house of Yahweh which is in Jerusalem, offered willingly  for the house of God to set it up in its place:
002:069 they gave after their ability into the treasury of the work  sixty-one thousand darics of gold, and five thousand minas  of silver, and one hundred priests' garments.
002:070 So the priests, and the Levites, and some of the people,  and the singers, and the porters, and the Nethinim,  lived in their cities, and all Israel in their cities.
010:044 While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit  fell on all those who heard the word.
034:036 I wish that Job were tried to the end, because of his answering  like wicked men.
034:037 For he adds rebellion to his sin.  He claps his hands among us,  and multiplies his words against God."
038:032 Can you lead forth the constellations in their season?  Or can you guide the Bear with her cubs?
038:033 Do you know the laws of the heavens?  Can you establish  the dominion of it over the earth?
038:034 "Can you lift up your voice to the clouds, That abundance  of waters may cover you?
038:035 Can you send forth lightnings, that they may go?  Do they report to you, 'Here we are?'
038:036 Who has put wisdom in the inward parts?  Or who has given  understanding to the mind?
038:037 Who can number the clouds by wisdom?  Or who can pour out  the bottles of the sky,
038:038 when the dust runs into a mass, and the clods of  earth stick together?
038:039 "Can you hunt the prey for the lioness, or satisfy the appetite  of the young lions,
038:040 when they crouch in their dens, and lie in wait in the thicket?
038:041 Who provides for the raven his prey, when his young ones cry  to God, and wander for lack of food?
018:047 even the God who executes vengeance for me, and subdues  peoples under me.
018:048 He rescues me from my enemies.  Yes, you lift me up above those  who rise up against me.  You deliver me from the violent man.
018:049 Therefore I will give thanks to you, Yahweh, among the nations,  and will sing praises to your name.
018:050 He gives great deliverance to his king, and shows loving kindness  to his anointed, to David and to his seed, forevermore.
037:037 So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, went away,  returned to Nineveh, and stayed there.
037:038 It happened, as he was worshipping in the house of Nisroch  his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons struck him  with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Ararat.  Esar Haddon his son reigned in his place.
037:039 But the salvation of the righteous is from Yahweh.  He is their stronghold in the time of trouble.
037:040 Yahweh helps them, and rescues them.  He rescues them from the wicked,  and saves them, Because they have taken refuge in him.
051:001 Thus says Yahweh:  Behold, I will raise up against Babylon,  and against those who dwell in Lebkamai, a destroying wind.
051:002 I will send to Babylon strangers, who shall winnow her;  and they shall empty her land:  for in the day of trouble  they shall be against her round about.
051:003 Against [him who] bends let the archer bend his bow,  and against [him who] lifts himself up in his coat of mail:  and don't you spare her young men; destroy you utterly  all her army.
051:004 They shall fall down slain in the land of the Chaldeans,  and thrust through in her streets.
051:005 For Israel is not forsaken, nor Judah, of his God, of Yahweh  of Armies; though their land is full of guilt against  the Holy One of Israel.
051:006 Flee out of the midst of Babylon, and save every man his life;  don't be cut off in her iniquity:  for it is the time  of Yahweh's vengeance; he will render to her a recompense.
051:007 Babylon has been a golden cup in Yahweh's hand, who made  all the earth drunken:  the nations have drunk of her wine;  therefore the nations are mad.
051:008 Babylon is suddenly fallen and destroyed:  wail for her;  take balm for her pain, if so be she may be healed.
051:009 We would have healed Babylon, but she is not healed:  forsake her, and let us go everyone into his own country;  for her judgment reaches to heaven, and is lifted up even  to the skies.
051:010 Yahweh has brought forth our righteousness:  come, and let us  declare in Zion the work of Yahweh our God.
051:011 Make sharp the arrows; hold firm the shields:  Yahweh has stirred up the spirit of the kings of the Medes;  because his purpose is against Babylon, to destroy it:  for it is the vengeance of Yahweh, the vengeance of his temple.
051:012 Set up a standard against the walls of Babylon, make the  watch strong, set the watchmen, prepare the ambushes;  for Yahweh has both purposed and done that which he spoke  concerning the inhabitants of Babylon.
051:013 You who dwell on many waters, abundant in treasures, your end  is come, the measure of your covetousness.
051:014 Yahweh of Armies has sworn by himself, [saying], Surely I  will fill you with men, as with the canker worm; and they  shall lift up a shout against you.
051:015 He has made the earth by his power, he has established the world  by his wisdom, and by his understanding has he stretched  out the heavens:
051:016 when he utters his voice, there is a tumult of waters in the heavens,  and he causes the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth;  he makes lightning for the rain, and brings forth the wind  out of his treasuries.
051:017 Every man is become brutish [and is] without knowledge;  every goldsmith is disappointed by his image; for his molten  image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them.
051:018 They are vanity, a work of delusion:  in the time of their  visitation they shall perish.
051:019 The portion of Jacob is not like these; for he is the former  of all things; and [Israel] is the tribe of his inheritance:  Yahweh of Armies is his name.
052:001 Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he began to reign;  and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem:  and his mother's  name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.
052:002 He did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, according to  all that Jehoiakim had done.
052:003 For through the anger of Yahweh did it happen in Jerusalem  and Judah, until he had cast them out from his presence.  Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.
052:004 It happened in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month,  in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadnezzar king  of Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem,  and encamped against it; and they built forts against  it round about.
052:005 So the city was besieged to the eleventh year of king Zedekiah.
052:006 In the fourth month, in the ninth day of the month, the famine  was sore in the city, so that there was no bread for the people  of the land.
052:007 Then a breach was made in the city, and all the men of war fled,  and went forth out of the city by night by the way of the gate  between the two walls, which was by the king's garden;  (now the Chaldeans were against the city round about;)  and they went toward the Arabah.
052:008 But the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king,  and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho; and all his  army was scattered from him.
052:009 Then they took the king, and carried him up to the king  of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath; and he gave  judgment on him.
053:001 Who has believed our message?  To whom has the arm of  Yahweh been revealed?
053:002 For he grew up before him as a tender plant, and as a root  out of dry ground.  He has no form nor comeliness.  When we see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him.
053:003 He was despised, and rejected by men; a man of suffering,  and acquainted with disease.  He was despised as one from whom  men hide their face; and we didn't respect him.
053:004 Surely he has borne our sickness, and carried our suffering;  yet we considered him plagued, struck by God, and afflicted.
053:005 But he was pierced for our transgressions.  He was crushed  for our iniquities.  The punishment that brought our peace  was on him; and by his wounds we are healed.
053:006 All we like sheep have gone astray.  Everyone has turned to his  own way; and Yahweh has laid on him the iniquity of us all.
054:001 Sing, barren, you who didn't bear; break forth into singing,  and cry aloud, you who did not travail with child:  for more are the children of the desolate than the children  of the married wife, says Yahweh.
054:002 Enlarge the place of your tent, and let them stretch  forth the curtains of your habitations; don't spare:  lengthen your cords, and strengthen your stakes.
054:003 For you shall spread aboard on the right hand and on the left;  and your seed shall possess the nations, and make the desolate  cities to be inhabited.
054:004 Don't be afraid; for you shall not be ashamed:  neither be confounded; for you shall not be disappointed:  for you shall forget the shame of your youth; and the reproach  of your widowhood shall you remember no more.
054:005 For your Maker is your husband; Yahweh of Armies is his name:  and the Holy One of Israel is your Redeemer; the God of the whole  earth shall he be called.
054:006 For Yahweh has called you as a wife forsaken and grieved  in spirit, even a wife of youth, when she is cast off,  says your God.
054:007 For a small moment have I forsaken you; but with great mercies  will I gather you.
055:001 Ho, everyone who thirsts, come you to the waters, and he who has  no money; come you, buy, and eat; yes, come, buy wine and milk  without money and without price.
055:002 Why do you spend money for that which is not bread? and your  labor for that which doesn't satisfy? listen diligently to me,  and eat you that which is good, and let your soul delight  itself in fatness.
055:003 Turn your ear, and come to me; hear, and your soul shall live:  and I will make an everlasting covenant with you, even the sure  mercies of David.
055:004 Behold, I have given him for a witness to the peoples,  a leader and commander to the peoples.
055:005 Behold, you shall call a nation that you don't know;  and a nation that didn't know you shall run to you,  because of Yahweh your God, and for the Holy One of Israel;  for he has glorified you.
055:006 Seek you Yahweh while he may be found; call you on him while  he is near:
055:007 let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts;  and let him return to Yahweh, and he will have mercy on him;  and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.
055:008 For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways  my ways, says Yahweh.
055:009 For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways  higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.
055:010 For as the rain comes down and the snow from the sky,  and doesn't return there, but waters the earth, and makes it  bring forth and bud, and gives seed to the sower and bread  to the eater;
055:011 so shall my word be that goes forth out of my mouth:  it shall not return to me void, but it shall accomplish  that which I please, and it shall prosper in the thing I sent  it to do.
055:012 For you shall go out with joy, and be led forth with peace:  the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you  into singing; and all the trees of the fields shall  clap their hands.
055:013 Instead of the thorn shall come up the fir tree;  and instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle tree:  and it shall be to Yahweh for a name, for an everlasting sign  that shall not be cut off.
055:014 We took sweet fellowship together.  We walked in God's  house with company.
055:015 Let death come suddenly on them.  Let them go down alive into Sheol.  For wickedness is in their dwelling, in the midst of them.
055:016 As for me, I will call on God.  Yahweh will save me.
055:017 Evening, morning, and at noon, I will cry out in distress.  He will hear my voice.
055:018 He has redeemed my soul in peace from the battle that was  against me, although there are many who oppose me.
055:019 God, who is enthroned forever, will hear, and answer them.  Selah.  They never change, who don't fear God.
055:020 He raises his hands against his friends.  He has  violated his covenant.
055:021 His mouth was smooth as butter, but his heart was war.  His words were softer than oil, yet they were drawn swords.
055:022 Cast your burden on Yahweh, and he will sustain you.  He will never allow the righteous to be moved.
055:023 But you, God, will bring them down into the pit of destruction.  Bloodthirsty and deceitful men shall not live out half their days,  but I will trust in you.
056:001 Thus says Yahweh, Keep you justice, and do righteousness;  for my salvation is near to come, and my righteousness  to be revealed.
056:002 Blessed is the man who does this, and the son of man who holds  it fast; who keeps the Sabbath from profaning it, and keeps  his hand from doing any evil.
056:003 Neither let the foreigner, who has joined himself to Yahweh,  speak, saying, Yahweh will surely separate me from his people;  neither let the eunuch say, Behold, I am a dry tree.
056:004 For thus says Yahweh of the eunuchs who keep my Sabbaths,  and choose the things that please me, and hold fast my covenant:
056:005 To them will I give in my house and within my walls a memorial  and a name better than of sons and of daughters; I will give  them an everlasting name, that shall not be cut off.
056:006 Also the foreigners who join themselves to Yahweh, to minister  to him, and to love the name of Yahweh, to be his servants,  everyone who keeps the Sabbath from profaning it, and holds  fast my covenant;
056:007 even them will I bring to my holy mountain, and make them  joyful in my house of prayer:  their burnt offerings and their  sacrifices shall be accepted on my altar; for my house shall  be called a house of prayer for all peoples.
056:008 The Lord Yahweh, who gathers the outcasts of Israel, says, Yet will  I gather [others] to him, besides his own who are gathered.
056:009 All you animals of the field, come to devour, [yes], all you  animals in the forest.
056:010 His watchmen are blind, they are all without knowledge;  they are all mute dogs, they can't bark; dreaming, lying down,  loving to slumber.
056:011 Yes, the dogs are greedy, they can never have enough;  and these are shepherds who can't understand:  they have all turned to their own way, each one to his gain,  from every quarter.
056:012 Come you, [say they], I will get wine, and we will fill  ourselves with strong drink; and tomorrow shall be as this day,  [a day] great beyond measure.
056:013 For you have delivered my soul from death, and prevented my  feet from falling, that I may walk before God in the light  of the living.
057:001 The righteous perishes, and no man lays it to heart; and merciful  men are taken away, none considering that the righteous  is taken away from the evil [to come].
057:002 He enters into peace; they rest in their beds, each one who walks  in his uprightness.
057:003 But draw near here, you sons of the sorceress, the seed  of the adulterer and the prostitute.
057:004 Against whom do you sport yourselves? against whom make you  a wide mouth, and put out the tongue?  Aren't you children  of disobedience, a seed of falsehood,
057:005 you who inflame yourselves among the oaks, under every green tree;  who kill the children in the valleys, under the clefts  of the rocks?
057:006 Among the smooth [stones] of the valley is your portion;  they, they are your lot; even to them have you poured  a drink offering, you have offered an offering.  Shall I be appeased for these things?
057:007 On a high and lofty mountain have you set your bed;  there also you went up to offer sacrifice.
057:008 Behind the doors and the posts have you set up your memorial:  for you have uncovered [yourself] to another than me,  and are gone up; you have enlarged your bed, and made you  a covenant with them:  you loved their bed where you saw it.
057:009 You went to the king with oil, and did increase your perfumes,  and did send your ambassadors far off, and did debase yourself  even to Sheol.
057:010 You were wearied with the length of your way; yet you didn't say,  It is in vain:  you found a reviving of your strength;  therefore you weren't faint.
057:011 Of whom have you been afraid and in fear, that you lie,  and have not remembered me, nor laid it to your heart?  Haven't I held my peace even of long time, and you don't fear me?
058:001 Cry aloud, don't spare, lift up your voice like a trumpet,  and declare to my people their disobedience, and to the house  of Jacob their sins.
058:002 Yet they seek me daily, and delight to know my ways:  as a nation that did righteousness, and didn't forsake  the ordinance of their God, they ask of me righteous judgments;  they delight to draw near to God.
058:003 Why have we fasted, [say they], and you don't see? [why]  have we afflicted our soul, and you take no knowledge?  Behold, in the day of your fast you find [your own] pleasure,  and exact all your labors.
058:004 Behold, you fast for strife and contention, and to strike  with the fist of wickedness:  you don't fast this day so as  to make your voice to be heard on high.
058:005 Is such the fast that I have chosen? the day for a man  to afflict his soul?  Is it to bow down his head as a rush,  and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him? will you call  this a fast, and an acceptable day to Yahweh?
058:006 Isn't this the fast that I have chosen:  to loose the bonds  of wickedness, to undo the bands of the yoke, and to let  the oppressed go free, and that you break every yoke?
058:007 Isn't it to deal your bread to the hungry, and that you bring  the poor who are cast out to your house? when you see the naked,  that you cover him; and that you not hide yourself from  your own flesh?
058:008 Then shall your light break forth as the morning, and your healing  shall spring forth speedily; and your righteousness shall go  before you; the glory of Yahweh shall be your rear guard.
058:009 Then shall you call, and Yahweh will answer; you shall cry,  and he will say, Here I am.  If you take away from  the midst of you the yoke, the putting forth of the finger,  and speaking wickedly;
058:010 and if you draw out your soul to the hungry, and satisfy  the afflicted soul:  then shall your light rise in darkness,  and your obscurity be as the noonday;
058:011 and Yahweh will guide you continually, and satisfy your soul  in dry places, and make strong your bones; and you shall  be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water,  whose waters don't fail.
059:001 Behold, Yahweh's hand is not shortened, that it can't save;  neither his ear heavy, that it can't hear:
059:002 but your iniquities have separated between you and your God,  and your sins have hidden his face from you, so that he  will not hear.
059:003 For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with iniquity;  your lips have spoken lies, your tongue mutters wickedness.
059:004 None sues in righteousness, and none pleads in truth:  they trust in vanity, and speak lies; they conceive mischief,  and bring forth iniquity.
059:005 They hatch adders' eggs, and weave the spider's web:  he who eats of their eggs dies; and that which is crushed  breaks out into a viper.
059:006 Their webs shall not become garments, neither shall they cover  themselves with their works:  their works are works of iniquity,  and the act of violence is in their hands.
059:007 Their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed innocent blood:  their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity; desolation and  destruction are in their paths.
059:008 The way of peace they don't know; and there is no justice  in their goings:  they have made them crooked paths;  whoever goes therein does not know peace.
059:009 Therefore is justice far from us, neither does righteousness  overtake us:  we look for light, but, behold, darkness;  for brightness, but we walk in obscurity.
059:010 We grope for the wall like the blind; yes, we grope as those  who have no eyes:  we stumble at noonday as in the twilight;  among those who are lusty we are as dead men.
059:011 We roar all like bears, and moan sore like doves:  we look for justice, but there is none; for salvation,  but it is far off from us.
059:012 For our transgressions are multiplied before you, and our sins  testify against us; for our transgressions are with us,  and as for our iniquities, we know them:
059:013 transgressing and denying Yahweh, and turning away from following  our God, speaking oppression and revolt, conceiving and uttering  from the heart words of falsehood.
059:014 Justice is turned away backward, and righteousness stands afar off;  for truth is fallen in the street, and uprightness can't enter.
059:015 Yes, truth is lacking; and he who departs from evil makes himself  a prey.  Yahweh saw it, and it displeased him that there  was no justice.
059:016 He saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was  no intercessor:  therefore his own arm brought salvation to him;  and his righteousness, it upheld him.
059:017 He put on righteousness as a breastplate, and a helmet of salvation  on his head; and he put on garments of vengeance for clothing,  and was clad with zeal as a mantle.
060:001 Arise, shine; for your light is come, and the glory of Yahweh  is risen on you.
060:002 For, behold, darkness shall cover the earth, and gross darkness  the peoples; but Yahweh will arise on you, and his glory  shall be seen on you.
060:003 Nations shall come to your light, and kings to the brightness  of your rising.
060:004 Lift up your eyes round about, and see:  they all gather  themselves together, they come to you; your sons shall come  from far, and your daughters shall be carried in the arms.
060:005 Then you shall see and be radiant, and your heart shall thrill  and be enlarged; because the abundance of the sea shall be  turned to you, the wealth of the nations shall come to you.
060:006 The multitude of camels shall cover you, the dromedaries  of Midian and Ephah; all they from Sheba shall come;  they shall bring gold and frankincense, and shall proclaim  the praises of Yahweh.
060:007 All the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered together to you,  the rams of Nebaioth shall minister to you; they shall come  up with acceptance on my altar; and I will glorify the house  of my glory.
060:008 Who are these who fly as a cloud, and as the doves to their windows?
060:009 Surely the islands shall wait for me, and the ships of  Tarshish first, to bring your sons from far, their silver  and their gold with them, for the name of Yahweh your God,  and for the Holy One of Israel, because he has glorified you.
060:010 Foreigners shall build up your walls, and their kings shall  minister to you:  for in my wrath I struck you, but in my favor  have I had mercy on you.
060:011 Your gates also shall be open continually; they shall not be  shut day nor night; that men may bring to you the wealth  of the nations, and their kings led captive.
060:012 For that nation and kingdom that will not serve you shall perish;  yes, those nations shall be utterly wasted.
061:001 The Spirit of the Lord Yahweh is on me; because Yahweh has anointed  me to preach good news to the humble; he has sent me to bind  up the broken-hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives,  and the opening [of the prison] to those who are bound;
061:002 to proclaim the year of Yahweh's favor, and the day of vengeance  of our God; to comfort all who mourn;
061:003 to appoint to those who mourn in Zion, to give to them  a garland for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment  of praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they may be  called trees of righteousness, the planting of Yahweh,  that he may be glorified.
061:004 They shall build the old wastes, they shall raise up the  former desolations, and they shall repair the waste cities,  the desolations of many generations.
061:005 Strangers shall stand and feed your flocks, and foreigners  shall be your plowmen and your vinedressers.
061:006 But you shall be named the priests of Yahweh; men shall call  you the ministers of our God:  you shall eat the wealth  of the nations, and in their glory shall you boast yourselves.
061:007 Instead of your shame [you shall have] double; and instead  of dishonor they shall rejoice in their portion:  therefore in their land they shall possess double;  everlasting joy shall be to them.
061:008 For I, Yahweh, love justice, I hate robbery with iniquity;  and I will give them their recompense in truth, and I will  make an everlasting covenant with them.
062:001 For Zion's sake will I not hold my peace, and for Jerusalem's sake  I will not rest, until her righteousness go forth as brightness,  and her salvation as a lamp that burns.
062:002 The nations shall see your righteousness, and all kings your glory,  and you shall be called by a new name, which the mouth  of Yahweh shall name.
062:003 You shall also be a crown of beauty in the hand of Yahweh,  and a royal diadem in the hand of your God.
062:004 You shall no more be termed Forsaken; neither shall your land  any more be termed Desolate:  but you shall be called Hephzibah,  and your land Beulah; for Yahweh delights in you, and your  land shall be married.
062:005 For as a young man marries a virgin, so shall your sons marry you;  and as the bridegroom rejoices over the bride, so shall  your God rejoice over you.
062:006 I have set watchmen on your walls, Jerusalem; they shall  never hold their peace day nor night:  you who call on Yahweh,  take no rest,
062:007 and give him no rest, until he establishes, and until he makes  Jerusalem a praise in the earth.
062:008 Yahweh has sworn by his right hand, and by the arm of his strength,  Surely I will no more give your grain to be food for your enemies;  and foreigners shall not drink your new wine, for which  you have labored:
062:009 but those who have garnered it shall eat it, and praise Yahweh;  and those who have gathered it shall drink it in the courts  of my sanctuary.
062:010 Go through, go through the gates; prepare you the way of the people;  cast up, cast up the highway; gather out the stones;  lift up a banner for the peoples.
062:011 Behold, Yahweh has proclaimed to the end of the earth,  Say you to the daughter of Zion, Behold, your salvation comes;  behold, his reward is with him, and his recompense before him.
062:012 They shall call them The holy people, The redeemed of Yahweh:  and you shall be called Sought out, A city not forsaken.
063:001 Who is this who comes from Edom, with dyed garments from  Bozrah? this who is glorious in his clothing, marching in  the greatness of his strength?  I who speak in righteousness,  mighty to save.
063:002 Why are you red in your clothing, and your garments like him  who treads in the wine vat?
063:003 I have trodden the winepress alone; and of the peoples there was  no man with me:  yes, I trod them in my anger, and trampled them  in my wrath; and their lifeblood is sprinkled on my garments,  and I have stained all my clothing.
063:004 For the day of vengeance was in my heart, and the year of my  redeemed is come.
063:005 I looked, and there was none to help; and I wondered that there  was none to uphold:  therefore my own arm brought salvation to me;  and my wrath, it upheld me.
063:006 I trod down the peoples in my anger, and made them drunk  in my wrath, and I poured out their lifeblood on the earth.
063:007 I will make mention of the loving kindnesses of Yahweh,  [and] the praises of Yahweh, according to all that Yahweh has  bestowed on us, and the great goodness toward the house of Israel,  which he has bestowed on them according to his mercies,  and according to the multitude of his loving kindnesses.
063:008 For he said, Surely, they are my people, children who will  not deal falsely:  so he was their Savior.
063:009 In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the angel of his  presence saved them:  in his love and in his pity he redeemed them;  and he bore them, and carried them all the days of old.
063:010 But they rebelled, and grieved his holy Spirit:  therefore he was turned to be their enemy, [and] himself  fought against them.
063:011 Then he remembered the days of old, Moses [and] his people,  [saying], Where is he who brought them up out of the sea  with the shepherds of his flock? where is he who put his holy  Spirit in the midst of them?
064:001 Oh that you would tear the heavens, that you would come down,  that the mountains might quake at your presence,
064:002 as when fire kindles the brushwood, [and] the fire causes  the waters to boil; to make your name known to your adversaries,  that the nations may tremble at your presence!
064:003 When you did terrible things which we didn't look for,  you came down, the mountains quaked at your presence.
064:004 For from of old men have not heard, nor perceived by the ear,  neither has the eye seen a God besides you, who works for him  who waits for him.
064:005 You meet him who rejoices and works righteousness, those who remember  you in your ways:  behold, you were angry, and we sinned:  in them [have we been] of long time; and shall we be saved?
064:006 For we have all become as one who is unclean, and all our  righteousness is as a polluted garment:  and we all fade as a leaf;  and our iniquities, like the wind, take us away.
064:007 There is none who calls on your name, who stirs up himself  to take hold of you; for you have hid your face from us,  and have consumed us by means of our iniquities.
064:008 But now, Yahweh, you are our Father; we are the clay, and you  our potter; and we all are the work of your hand.
064:009 Don't be furious, Yahweh, neither remember iniquity forever:  see, look, we beg you, we are all your people.
064:010 Your holy cities are become a wilderness, Zion is become  a wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation.
065:001 I am inquired of by those who didn't ask; I am found by those  who didn't seek me:  I said, See me, see me, to a nation  that was not called by my name.
065:002 I have spread out my hands all the day to a rebellious people,  who walk in a way that is not good, after their own thoughts;
065:003 a people who provoke me to my face continually, sacrificing  in gardens, and burning incense on bricks;
065:004 who sit among the graves, and lodge in the secret places;  who eat pig's flesh, and broth of abominable things is  in their vessels;
065:005 who say, Stand by yourself, don't come near to me,  for I am holier than you.  These are a smoke in my nose,  a fire that burns all the day.
065:006 Behold, it is written before me:  I will not keep silence,  but will recompense, yes, I will recompense into their bosom,
065:007 your own iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together,  says Yahweh, who have burned incense on the mountains,  and blasphemed me on the hills; therefore will I first measure  their work into their bosom.
065:008 Thus says Yahweh, As the new wine is found in the cluster,  and one says, Don't destroy it, for a blessing is in it:  so will I do for my servants' sake, that I may not  destroy them all.
065:009 I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah  an inheritor of my mountains; and my chosen shall inherit it,  and my servants shall dwell there.
065:010 Sharon shall be a fold of flocks, and the valley of Achor a place  for herds to lie down in, for my people who have sought me.
065:011 But you who forsake Yahweh, who forget my holy mountain,  who prepare a table for Fortune, and who fill up mixed  wine to Destiny;
065:012 I will destine you to the sword, and you shall all bow down  to the slaughter; because when I called, you did not answer;  when I spoke, you did not hear; but you did that which was  evil in my eyes, and chose that in which I didn't delight.
065:013 Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh, Behold, my servants shall eat,  but you shall be hungry; behold, my servants shall drink,  but you shall be thirsty; behold, my servants shall rejoice,  but you shall be disappointed;
066:001 Thus says Yahweh, heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool:  what manner of house will you build to me? and what place  shall be my rest?
066:002 For all these things has my hand made, and [so] all these things  came to be, says Yahweh:  but to this man will I look,  even to him who is poor and of a contrite spirit, and who  trembles at my word.
066:003 He who kills an ox is as he who kills a man; he who sacrifices  a lamb, as he who breaks a dog's neck; he who offers an offering,  [as he who offers] pig's blood; he who burns frankincense,  as he who blesses an idol.  Yes, they have chosen their own ways,  and their soul delights in their abominations:
066:004 I also will choose their delusions, and will bring their fears  on them; because when I called, none did answer; when I spoke,  they did not hear:  but they did that which was evil in my eyes,  and chose that in which I didn't delight.
066:005 Hear the word of Yahweh, you who tremble at his word:  Your brothers who hate you, who cast you out for my name's sake,  have said, Let Yahweh be glorified, that we may see your joy;  but it is those who shall be disappointed.
066:006 A voice of tumult from the city, a voice from the temple,  a voice of Yahweh that renders recompense to his enemies.
066:007 Before she travailed, she brought forth; before her pain came,  she was delivered of a boy.
066:008 Who has heard such a thing? who has seen such things?  Shall a land be born in one day? shall a nation be brought  forth at once? for as soon as Zion travailed, she brought  forth her children.
066:009 Shall I bring to the birth, and not cause to bring forth?  says Yahweh:  shall I who cause to bring forth shut [the  womb]? says your God.
066:010 Rejoice you with Jerusalem, and be glad for her, all you who  love her:  rejoice for joy with her, all you who mourn over her;
066:011 that you may suck and be satisfied with the breasts of  her consolations; that you may milk out, and be delighted  with the abundance of her glory.
066:012 For thus says Yahweh, Behold, I will extend peace to her like a river,  and the glory of the nations like an overflowing stream:  and you shall suck [of it]; you shall be borne on the side,  and shall be dandled on the knees.
066:013 As one whom his mother comforts, so will I comfort you;  and you shall be comforted in Jerusalem.
066:014 You shall see [it], and your heart shall rejoice,  and your bones shall flourish like the tender grass:  and the hand of Yahweh shall be known toward his servants;  and he will have indignation against his enemies.
066:015 For, behold, Yahweh will come with fire, and his chariots shall  be like the whirlwind; to render his anger with fierceness,  and his rebuke with flames of fire.
066:016 For by fire will Yahweh execute judgment, and by his sword,  on all flesh; and the slain of Yahweh shall be many.
066:017 Those who sanctify themselves and purify themselves [to go]  to the gardens, behind one in the midst, eating pig's flesh,  and the abomination, and the mouse, they shall come to an  end together, says Yahweh.
066:018 For I [know] their works and their thoughts:  [the time] comes,  that I will gather all nations and languages; and they shall come,  and shall see my glory.
066:019 I will set a sign among them, and I will send such as escape  of them to the nations, to Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, who draw  the bow, to Tubal and Javan, to the islands afar off,  who have not heard my fame, neither have seen my glory;  and they shall declare my glory among the nations.
066:020 They shall bring all your brothers out of all the nations for an  offering to Yahweh, on horses, and in chariots, and in litters,  and on mules, and on dromedaries, to my holy mountain Jerusalem,  says Yahweh, as the children of Israel bring their offering  in a clean vessel into the house of Yahweh.
067:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  With stringed instruments.  A Psalm.  A song.>> May God be merciful to us, bless us,  and cause his face to shine on us.  Selah.
067:002 That your way may be known on earth, and your salvation  among all nations,
067:003 let the peoples praise you, God.  Let all the peoples praise you.
067:004 Oh let the nations be glad and sing for joy, for you will judge  the peoples with equity, and govern the nations on earth.  Selah.
067:005 Let the peoples praise you, God.  Let all the peoples praise you.
067:006 The earth has yielded its increase.  God, even our own God,  will bless us.
067:007 God will bless us.  All the ends of the earth shall fear him.
068:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  A Psalm by David.  A song.>> Let God arise!  Let his enemies be scattered!  Let them who hate him also flee before him.
068:002 As smoke is driven away, so drive them away.  As wax melts before  the fire, so let the wicked perish at the presence of God.
068:003 But let the righteous be glad.  Let them rejoice before God.  Yes, let them rejoice with gladness.
068:004 Sing to God!  Sing praises to his name!  Extol him who rides  on the clouds:  to Yah, his name!  Rejoice before him!
068:005 A father of the fatherless, and a defender of the widows,  is God in his holy habitation.
068:006 God sets the lonely in families.  He brings out the prisoners  with singing, but the rebellious dwell in a sun-scorched land.
068:007 God, when you went forth before your people, when you marched  through the wilderness... Selah.
068:008 The earth trembled.  The sky also poured down rain at  the presence of the God of Sinai--at the presence of God,  the God of Israel.
068:009 You, God, sent a plentiful rain.  You confirmed your inheritance,  when it was weary.
068:010 Your congregation lived therein.  You, God, prepared your  goodness for the poor.
068:011 The Lord announced the word.  The ones who proclaim it are  a great company.
068:012 "Kings of armies flee!  They flee!"  She who waits at home  divides the spoil,
068:013 while you sleep among the campfires, the wings of a dove  sheathed with silver, her feathers with shining gold.
068:014 When the Almighty scattered kings in her, it snowed on Zalmon.
068:015 The mountains of Bashan are majestic mountains.  The mountains of Bashan are rugged.
068:016 Why do you look in envy, you rugged mountains, at the mountain  where God chooses to reign?  Yes, Yahweh will dwell there forever.
068:017 The chariots of God are tens of thousands and thousands of thousands.  The Lord is among them, from Sinai, into the sanctuary.
068:018 You have ascended on high.  You have led away captives.  You have received gifts among men, yes, among the rebellious also,  that Yah God might dwell there.
068:019 Blessed be the Lord, who daily bears our burdens, even the God  who is our salvation.  Selah.
068:020 God is to us a God of deliverance.  To Yahweh, the Lord,  belongs escape from death.
068:021 But God will strike through the head of his enemies, the hairy  scalp of such a one as still continues in his guiltiness.
068:022 The Lord said, "I will bring you again from Bashan, I will bring  you again from the depths of the sea;
068:023 That you may crush them, dipping your foot in blood,  that the tongues of your dogs may have their portion  from your enemies."
068:024 They have seen your processions, God, even the processions  of my God, my King, into the sanctuary.
068:025 The singers went before, the minstrels followed after,  in the midst of the ladies playing with tambourines,
068:026 "Bless God in the congregations, even the Lord in the  assembly of Israel!"
068:027 There is little Benjamin, their ruler, the princes of Judah,  their council, the princes of Zebulun, and the princes of Naphtali.
068:028 Your God has commanded your strength.  Strengthen, God, that which  you have done for us.
068:029 Because of your temple at Jerusalem, kings shall bring  presents to you.
068:030 Rebuke the wild animal of the reeds, the multitude of the bulls,  with the calves of the peoples.  Being humbled, may it bring  bars of silver.  Scatter the nations that delight in war.
068:031 Princes shall come out of Egypt.  Ethiopia shall hurry to stretch  out her hands to God.
068:032 Sing to God, you kingdoms of the earth!  Sing praises to  the Lord!  Selah.
068:033 To him who rides on the heaven of heavens, which are of old;  behold, he utters his voice, a mighty voice.
068:034 Ascribe strength to God!  His excellency is over Israel,  his strength is in the skies.
068:035 You are awesome, God, in your sanctuaries.  The God of Israel gives strength and power to his people.  Praise be to God!
069:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  To the tune of "Lilies." By David.>>  Save me, God, for the waters have come up to my neck!
069:002 I sink in deep mire, where there is no foothold.  I have come into deep waters, where the floods overflow me.
069:003 I am weary with my crying.  My throat is dry.  My eyes fail,  looking for my God.
069:004 Those who hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of my head.  Those who want to cut me off, being my enemies wrongfully,  are mighty.  I have to restore what I didn't take away.
069:005 God, you know my foolishness.  My sins aren't hidden from you.
069:006 Don't let those who wait for you be shamed through me,  Lord Yahweh of Armies.  Don't let those who seek you be brought  to dishonor through me, God of Israel.
069:007 Because for your sake, I have borne reproach.  Shame has  covered my face.
069:008 I have become a stranger to my brothers, an alien to  my mother's children.
069:009 For the zeal of your house consumes me.  The reproaches  of those who reproach you have fallen on me.
069:010 When I wept and I fasted, that was to my reproach.
069:011 When I made sackcloth my clothing, I became a byword to them.
069:012 Those who sit in the gate talk about me.  I am the song  of the drunkards.
069:013 But as for me, my prayer is to you, Yahweh, in an acceptable time.  God, in the abundance of your loving kindness, answer me  in the truth of your salvation.
069:014 Deliver me out of the mire, and don't let me sink.  Let me be delivered from those who hate me, and out of  the deep waters.
069:015 Don't let the flood waters overwhelm me, neither let the deep  swallow me up.  Don't let the pit shut its mouth on me.
069:016 Answer me, Yahweh, for your loving kindness is good.  According to the multitude of your tender mercies, turn to me.
069:017 Don't hide your face from your servant, for I am in distress.  Answer me speedily!
069:018 Draw near to my soul, and redeem it.  Ransom me because  of my enemies.
069:019 You know my reproach, my shame, and my dishonor.  My adversaries are all before you.
069:020 Reproach has broken my heart, and I am full of heaviness.  I looked for some to take pity, but there was none;  for comforters, but I found none.
069:021 They also gave me gall for my food.  In my thirst, they gave  me vinegar to drink.
069:022 Let their table before them become a snare.  May it become  a retribution and a trap.
069:023 Let their eyes be darkened, so that they can't see.  Let their backs be continually bent.
069:024 Pour out your indignation on them.  Let the fierceness of your  anger overtake them.
069:025 Let their habitation be desolate.  Let no one dwell in their tents.
069:026 For they persecute him whom you have wounded.  They tell  of the sorrow of those whom you have hurt.
069:027 Charge them with crime upon crime.  Don't let them come  into your righteousness.
069:028 Let them be blotted out of the book of life, and not be written  with the righteous.
069:029 But I am in pain and distress.  Let your salvation, God, protect me.
069:030 I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify  him with thanksgiving.
069:031 It will please Yahweh better than an ox, or a bull that has  horns and hoofs.
069:032 The humble have seen it, and are glad.  You who seek after God,  let your heart live.
069:033 For Yahweh hears the needy, and doesn't despise his captive people.
069:034 Let heaven and earth praise him; the seas, and everything  that moves therein!
069:035 For God will save Zion, and build the cities of Judah.  They shall settle there, and own it.
069:036 The children also of his servants shall inherit it.  Those who love his name shall dwell therein.
070:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  By David.  A reminder.>> Hurry, God,  to deliver me.  Come quickly to help me, Yahweh.
070:002 Let them be disappointed and confounded who seek my soul.  Let those who desire my ruin be turned back in disgrace.
070:003 Let them be turned because of their shame Who say, "Aha!  Aha!"
070:004 Let all those who seek you rejoice and be glad in you.  Let those who love your salvation continually say,  "Let God be exalted!"
070:005 But I am poor and needy.  Come to me quickly, God.  You are  my help and my deliverer.  Yahweh, don't delay.
071:001 In you, Yahweh, I take refuge.  Never let me be disappointed.
071:002 Deliver me in your righteousness, and rescue me.  Turn your ear to me, and save me.
071:003 Be to me a rock of refuge to which I may always go.  Give the command to save me, for you are my rock and my fortress.
071:004 Rescue me, my God, from the hand of the wicked, from the hand  of the unrighteous and cruel man.
071:005 For you are my hope, Lord Yahweh; my confidence from my youth.
071:006 I have relied on you from the womb.  You are he who took me  out of my mother's womb.  I will always praise you.
071:007 I am a marvel to many, but you are my strong refuge.
071:008 My mouth shall be filled with your praise, with your honor  all the day.
071:009 Don't reject me in my old age.  Don't forsake me when  my strength fails.
071:010 For my enemies talk about me.  Those who watch for my  soul conspire together,
071:011 saying, "God has forsaken him.  Pursue and take him, for no  one will rescue him."
071:012 God, don't be far from me.  My God, hurry to help me.
071:013 Let my accusers be disappointed and consumed.  Let them be  covered with disgrace and scorn who want to harm me.
071:014 But I will always hope, and will add to all of your praise.
071:015 My mouth will tell about your righteousness, and of your  salvation all day, though I don't know its full measure.
071:016 I will come with the mighty acts of the Lord Yahweh.  I will make mention of your righteousness, even of yours alone.
071:017 God, you have taught me from my youth.  Until now, I have  declared your wondrous works.
071:018 Yes, even when I am old and gray-haired, God, don't forsake me,  until I have declared your strength to the next generation,  your might to everyone who is to come.
071:019 Your righteousness also, God, reaches to the heavens;  you have done great things.  God, who is like you?
071:020 You, who have shown us many and bitter troubles, you will  let me live.  You will bring us up again from the depths  of the earth.
071:021 Increase my honor, and comfort me again.
071:022 I will also praise you with the harp for your faithfulness, my God.  I sing praises to you with the lyre, Holy One of Israel.
071:023 My lips shall shout for joy!  My soul, which you have redeemed,  sings praises to you!
071:024 My tongue will also talk about your righteousness all day long,  for they are disappointed, and they are confounded, who want  to harm me.
072:001 <<By Solomon.>> God, give the king your justice; your righteousness  to the royal son.
072:002 He will judge your people with righteousness, and your  poor with justice.
072:003 The mountains shall bring prosperity to the people.  The hills bring the fruit of righteousness.
072:004 He will judge the poor of the people.  He will save the children  of the needy, and will break the oppressor in pieces.
072:005 They shall fear you while the sun endures; and as long as the moon,  throughout all generations.
072:006 He will come down like rain on the mown grass, as showers  that water the earth.
072:007 In his days, the righteous shall flourish, and abundance of peace,  until the moon is no more.
072:008 He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, from the River  to the ends of the earth.
072:009 Those who dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him.  His enemies shall lick the dust.
072:010 The kings of Tarshish and of the islands will bring tribute.  The kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts.
072:011 Yes, all kings shall fall down before him.  All nations  shall serve him.
072:012 For he will deliver the needy when he cries; the poor,  who has no helper.
072:013 He will have pity on the poor and needy.  He will save the souls  of the needy.
072:014 He will redeem their soul from oppression and violence.  Their blood will be precious in his sight.
072:015 They shall live, and to him shall be given of the gold of Sheba.  Men shall pray for him continually.  They shall bless him  all day long.
072:016 There shall be abundance of grain throughout the land.  Its fruit sways like Lebanon.  Let it flourish, thriving like  the grass of the field.
072:017 His name endures forever.  His name continues as long as the sun.  Men shall be blessed by him.  All nations will call him blessed.
072:018 Praise be to Yahweh God, the God of Israel, who alone  does marvelous deeds.
072:019 Blessed be his glorious name forever!  Let the whole earth  be filled with his glory!  Amen and amen.
072:020 This ends the prayers by David, the son of Jesse.
073:001 <<A Psalm by Asaph.>> Surely God is good to Israel, to those  who are pure in heart.
073:002 But as for me, my feet were almost gone.  My steps  had nearly slipped.
073:003 For I was envious of the arrogant, when I saw the prosperity  of the wicked.
073:004 For there are no struggles in their death, but their  strength is firm.
073:005 They are free from burdens of men, neither are they plagued  like other men.
073:006 Therefore pride is like a chain around their neck.  Violence covers them like a garment.
073:007 Their eyes bulge with fat.  Their minds pass the limits of conceit.
073:008 They scoff and speak with malice.  In arrogance,  they threaten oppression.
073:009 They have set their mouth in the heavens.  Their tongue walks  through the earth.
073:010 Therefore their people return to them, and they drink up  waters of abundance.
073:011 They say, "How does God know?  Is there knowledge in the Most High?"
073:012 Behold, these are the wicked.  Being always at ease,  they increase in riches.
073:013 Surely in vain I have cleansed my heart, and washed my  hands in innocence,
073:014 For all day long have I been plagued, and punished every morning.
073:015 If I had said, "I will speak thus;" behold, I would have betrayed  the generation of your children.
073:016 When I tried to understand this, it was too painful for me;
073:017 Until I entered God's sanctuary, and considered their latter end.
073:018 Surely you set them in slippery places.  You throw them  down to destruction.
073:019 How they are suddenly destroyed!  They are completely swept  away with terrors.
073:020 As a dream when one wakes up, so, Lord, when you awake,  you will despise their fantasies.
073:021 For my soul was grieved.  I was embittered in my heart.
073:022 I was so senseless and ignorant.  I was a brute beast before you.
073:023 Nevertheless, I am continually with you.  You have held  my right hand.
073:024 You will guide me with your counsel, and afterward receive  me to glory.
073:025 Who do I have in heaven?  There is no one on earth who I  desire besides you.
073:026 My flesh and my heart fails, but God is the strength of my heart  and my portion forever.
073:027 For, behold, those who are far from you shall perish.  You have destroyed all those who are unfaithful to you.
073:028 But it is good for me to come close to God.  I have made  the Lord Yahweh my refuge, that I may tell of all your works.
074:001 <<A contemplation by Asaph.>> God, why have you rejected us forever?  Why does your anger smolder against the sheep of your pasture?
074:002 Remember your congregation, which you purchased of old,  which you have redeemed to be the tribe of your inheritance;  Mount Zion, in which you have lived.
074:003 Lift up your feet to the perpetual ruins, all the evil that  the enemy has done in the sanctuary.
074:004 Your adversaries have roared in the midst of your assembly.  They have set up their standards as signs.
074:005 They behaved like men wielding axes, cutting through a  thicket of trees.
074:006 Now they break all its carved work down with hatchet and hammers.
074:007 They have burned your sanctuary to the ground.  They have profaned the dwelling place of your Name.
074:008 They said in their heart, "We will crush them completely."  They have burned up all the places in the land where  God was worshiped.
074:009 We see no miraculous signs.  There is no longer any prophet,  neither is there among us anyone who knows how long.
074:010 How long, God, shall the adversary reproach?  Shall the enemy  blaspheme your name forever?
074:011 Why do you draw back your hand, even your right hand?  Take it out of your pocket and consume them!
074:012 Yet God is my King of old, working salvation in the midst  of the earth.
074:013 You divided the sea by your strength.  You broke the heads  of the sea monsters in the waters.
074:014 You broke the heads of Leviathan in pieces.  You gave him  as food to people and desert creatures.
074:015 You opened up spring and stream.  You dried up mighty rivers.
074:016 The day is yours, the night is also yours.  You have prepared  the light and the sun.
074:017 You have set all the boundaries of the earth.  You have made  summer and winter.
074:018 Remember this, that the enemy has mocked you, Yahweh.  Foolish people have blasphemed your name.
074:019 Don't deliver the soul of your dove to wild beasts.  Don't forget the life of your poor forever.
074:020 Honor your covenant, for haunts of violence fill the dark  places of the earth.
074:021 Don't let the oppressed return ashamed.  Let the poor and needy  praise your name.
074:022 Arise, God!  Plead your own cause.  Remember how the foolish  man mocks you all day.
074:023 Don't forget the voice of your adversaries.  The tumult  of those who rise up against you ascends continually.
075:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  To the tune of "Do Not Destroy."  A Psalm by Asaph.  A song.>> We give thanks to you, God.  We give thanks, for your Name is near.  Men tell about  your wondrous works.
075:002 When I choose the appointed time, I will judge blamelessly.
075:003 The earth and all its inhabitants quake.  I firmly hold  its pillars.  Selah.
075:004 I said to the arrogant, "Don't boast!"  I said to the wicked,  "Don't lift up the horn.
075:005 Don't lift up your horn on high.  Don't speak with a stiff neck."
075:006 For neither from the east, nor from the west, nor yet from  the south, comes exaltation.
075:007 But God is the judge.  He puts down one, and lifts up another.
075:008 For in the hand of Yahweh there is a cup, full of foaming  wine mixed with spices.  He pours it out.  Indeed the wicked  of the earth drink and drink it to its very dregs.
075:009 But I will declare this forever:  I will sing praises to  the God of Jacob.
075:010 I will cut off all the horns of the wicked, but the horns  of the righteous shall be lifted up.
076:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  On stringed instruments.  A Psalm by Asaph.  A song.>> In Judah, God is known.  His name is great in Israel.
076:002 His tent is also in Salem; His dwelling place in Zion.
076:003 There he broke the flaming arrows of the bow, the shield,  and the sword, and the weapons of war.  Selah.
076:004 Glorious are you, and excellent, more than mountains of game.
076:005 Valiant men lie plundered, they have slept their last sleep.  None of the men of war can lift their hands.
076:006 At your rebuke, God of Jacob, both chariot and horse are cast  into a deep sleep.
076:007 You, even you, are to be feared.  Who can stand in your sight  when you are angry?
076:008 You pronounced judgment from heaven.  The earth feared,  and was silent,
076:009 when God arose to judgment, to save all the afflicted ones  of the earth.  Selah.
076:010 Surely the wrath of man praises you.  The survivors of your  wrath are restrained.
076:011 Make vows to Yahweh your God, and fulfill them!  Let all of his  neighbors bring presents to him who is to be feared.
076:012 He will cut off the spirit of princes.  He is feared by the kings  of the earth.
077:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  To Jeduthun.  A Psalm by Asaph.>> My  cry goes to God!  Indeed, I cry to God for help, and for him  to listen to me.
077:002 In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord.  My hand  was stretched out in the night, and didn't get tired.  My soul refused to be comforted.
077:003 I remember God, and I groan.  I complain, and my spirit  is overwhelmed.  Selah.
077:004 You hold my eyelids open.  I am so troubled that I can't speak.
077:005 I have considered the days of old, the years of ancient times.
077:006 I remember my song in the night.  I consider in my own heart;  my spirit diligently inquires:
077:007 "Will the Lord reject us forever?  Will he be favorable no more?
077:008 Has his loving kindness vanished forever?  Does his promise  fail for generations?
077:009 Has God forgotten to be gracious?  Has he, in anger,  withheld his compassion?"  Selah.
077:010 Then I thought, "I will appeal to this:  the years of the right  hand of the Most High."
077:011 I will remember Yah's deeds; for I will remember your  wonders of old.
077:012 I will also meditate on all your work, and consider your doings.
077:013 Your way, God, is in the sanctuary.  What god is great like God?
077:014 You are the God who does wonders.  You have made your strength  known among the peoples.
077:015 You have redeemed your people with your arm, the sons of Jacob  and Joseph.  Selah.
077:016 The waters saw you, God.  The waters saw you, and they writhed.  The depths also convulsed.
077:017 The clouds poured out water.  The skies resounded with thunder.  Your arrows also flashed around.
077:018 The voice of your thunder was in the whirlwind.  The lightnings  lit up the world.  The earth trembled and shook.
077:019 Your way was through the sea; your paths through the great waters.  Your footsteps were not known.
077:020 You led your people like a flock, by the hand of Moses and Aaron.
078:001 <<A contemplation by Asaph.>> Hear my teaching, my people.  Turn your ears to the words of my mouth.
078:002 I will open my mouth in a parable.  I will utter dark  sayings of old,
078:003 Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.
078:004 We will not hide them from their children, telling to  the generation to come the praises of Yahweh, his strength,  and his wondrous works that he has done.
078:005 For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed  a teaching in Israel, which he commanded our fathers,  that they should make them known to their children;
078:006 that the generation to come might know, even the children  who should be born; who should arise and tell their children,
078:007 that they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works  of God, but keep his commandments,
078:008 and might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious  generation, a generation that didn't make their hearts loyal,  whose spirit was not steadfast with God.
078:009 The children of Ephraim, being armed and carrying bows,  turned back in the day of battle.
078:010 They didn't keep God's covenant, and refused to walk in his law.
078:011 They forgot his doings, his wondrous works that he had shown them.
078:012 He did marvelous things in the sight of their fathers,  in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.
078:013 He split the sea, and caused them to pass through.  He made the waters stand as a heap.
078:014 In the daytime he also led them with a cloud, and all night  with a light of fire.
078:015 He split rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink abundantly  as out of the depths.
078:016 He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters  to run down like rivers.
078:017 Yet they still went on to sin against him, to rebel against  the Most High in the desert.
078:018 They tempted God in their heart by asking food according  to their desire.
078:019 Yes, they spoke against God.  They said, "Can God prepare  a table in the wilderness?
078:020 Behold, he struck the rock, so that waters gushed out,  and streams overflowed.  Can he give bread also?  Will he provide flesh for his people?"
078:021 Therefore Yahweh heard, and was angry.  A fire was kindled  against Jacob, anger also went up against Israel,
078:022 because they didn't believe in God, and didn't trust  in his salvation.
078:023 Yet he commanded the skies above, and opened the doors of heaven.
078:024 He rained down manna on them to eat, and gave them food  from the sky.
078:025 Man ate the bread of angels.  He sent them food to the full.
078:026 He caused the east wind to blow in the sky.  By his power  he guided the south wind.
078:027 He rained also flesh on them as the dust; winged birds  as the sand of the seas.
078:028 He let them fall in the midst of their camp,  around their habitations.
078:029 So they ate, and were well filled.  He gave them their own desire.
078:030 They didn't turn from their cravings.  Their food was yet  in their mouths,
078:031 when the anger of God went up against them, killed some of  the fattest of them, and struck down the young men of Israel.
078:032 For all this they still sinned, and didn't believe in  his wondrous works.
078:033 Therefore he consumed their days in vanity, and their  years in terror.
078:034 When he killed them, then they inquired after him.  They returned and sought God earnestly.
078:035 They remembered that God was their rock, the Most High God,  their redeemer.
078:036 But they flattered him with their mouth, and lied to him  with their tongue.
078:037 For their heart was not right with him, neither were they  faithful in his covenant.
078:038 But he, being merciful, forgave iniquity, and didn't destroy them.  Yes, many times he turned his anger away, and didn't stir up  all his wrath.
078:039 He remembered that they were but flesh, a wind that passes away,  and doesn't come again.
078:040 How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness,  and grieved him in the desert!
078:041 They turned again and tempted God, and provoked the  Holy One of Israel.
078:042 They didn't remember his hand, nor the day when he redeemed  them from the adversary;
078:043 how he set his signs in Egypt, his wonders in the field of Zoan,
078:044 he turned their rivers into blood, and their streams,  so that they could not drink.
078:045 He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them;  and frogs, which destroyed them.
078:046 He gave also their increase to the caterpillar, and their labor  to the locust.
078:047 He destroyed their vines with hail, their sycamore fig  trees with frost.
078:048 He gave over their livestock also to the hail, and their flocks  to hot thunderbolts.
078:049 He threw on them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, indignation,  and trouble, and a band of angels of evil.
078:050 He made a path for his anger.  He didn't spare their soul  from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence,
078:051 and struck all the firstborn in Egypt, the chief of their  strength in the tents of Ham.
078:052 But he led forth his own people like sheep, and guided them  in the wilderness like a flock.
078:053 He led them safely, so that they weren't afraid, but the sea  overwhelmed their enemies.
078:054 He brought them to the border of his sanctuary, to this mountain,  which his right hand had taken.
078:055 He also drove out the nations before them, allotted them  for an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel  to dwell in their tents.
078:056 Yet they tempted and rebelled against the Most High God,  and didn't keep his testimonies;
078:057 but turned back, and dealt treacherously like their fathers.  They were turned aside like a deceitful bow.
078:058 For they provoked him to anger with their high places,  and moved him to jealousy with their engraved images.
078:059 When God heard this, he was angry, and greatly abhorred Israel;
078:060 So that he forsook the tent of Shiloh, the tent which he  placed among men;
078:061 and delivered his strength into captivity, his glory into  the adversary's hand.
078:062 He also gave his people over to the sword, and was angry  with his inheritance.
078:063 Fire devoured their young men.  Their virgins had no wedding song.
078:064 Their priests fell by the sword, and their widows couldn't weep.
078:065 Then the Lord awakened as one out of sleep, like a mighty man  who shouts by reason of wine.
078:066 He struck his adversaries backward.  He put them to  a perpetual reproach.
078:067 Moreover he rejected the tent of Joseph, and didn't choose  the tribe of Ephraim,
078:068 But chose the tribe of Judah, Mount Zion which he loved.
078:069 He built his sanctuary like the heights, like the earth  which he has established forever.
078:070 He also chose David his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds;
078:071 from following the ewes that have their young, he brought him to be  the shepherd of Jacob, his people, and Israel, his inheritance.
078:072 So he was their shepherd according to the integrity of his heart,  and guided them by the skillfulness of his hands.
079:001 <<A Psalm by Asaph.>> God, the nations have come into  your inheritance.  They have defiled your holy temple.  They have laid Jerusalem in heaps.
079:002 They have given the dead bodies of your servants to be food  for the birds of the sky, the flesh of your saints to the animals  of the earth.
079:003 Their blood they have shed like water around Jerusalem.  There was no one to bury them.
079:004 We have become a reproach to our neighbors, a scoffing and  derision to those who are around us.
079:005 How long, Yahweh?  Will you be angry forever?  Will your jealousy  burn like fire?
079:006 Pour out your wrath on the nations that don't know you;  on the kingdoms that don't call on your name;
079:007 For they have devoured Jacob, and destroyed his homeland.
079:008 Don't hold the iniquities of our forefathers against us.  Let your tender mercies speedily meet us, for we are  in desperate need.
079:009 Help us, God of our salvation, for the glory of your name.  Deliver us, and forgive our sins, for your name's sake.
079:010 Why should the nations say, "Where is their God?"  Let it  be known among the nations, before our eyes, that vengeance  for your servants' blood is being poured out.
079:011 Let the sighing of the prisoner come before you.  According to the greatness of your power, preserve those who  are sentenced to death.
079:012 Pay back to our neighbors seven times into their bosom their  reproach with which they have reproached you, Lord.
079:013 So we, your people and sheep of your pasture, will give you  thanks forever.  We will praise you forever, to all generations.
080:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  To the tune of "The Lilies of  the Covenant."  A Psalm by Asaph.>> Hear us, Shepherd of Israel,  you who lead Joseph like a flock, you who sit above  the cherubim, shine forth.
080:002 Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh, stir up your might!  Come to save us!
080:003 Turn us again, God.  Cause your face to shine, and we  will be saved.
080:004 Yahweh God of Armies, How long will you be angry against  the prayer of your people?
080:005 You have fed them with the bread of tears, and given them  tears to drink in large measure.
080:006 You make us a source of contention to our neighbors.  Our enemies laugh among themselves.
080:007 Turn us again, God of Armies.  Cause your face to shine,  and we will be saved.
080:008 You brought a vine out of Egypt.  You drove out the nations,  and planted it.
080:009 You cleared the ground for it.  It took deep root,  and filled the land.
080:010 The mountains were covered with its shadow.  Its boughs were  like God's cedars.
080:011 It sent out its branches to the sea, Its shoots to the River.
080:012 Why have you broken down its walls, so that all those who pass  by the way pluck it?
080:013 The boar out of the wood ravages it.  The wild animals  of the field feed on it.
080:014 Turn again, we beg you, God of Armies.  Look down from heaven,  and see, and visit this vine,
080:015 the stock which your right hand planted, the branch that you  made strong for yourself.
080:016 It's burned with fire.  It's cut down.  They perish at your rebuke.
080:017 Let your hand be on the man of your right hand, on the son  of man whom you made strong for yourself.
080:018 So we will not turn away from you.  Revive us, and we will call  on your name.
080:019 Turn us again, Yahweh God of Armies.  Cause your face to shine,  and we will be saved.
081:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  On an instrument of Gath.  By Asaph.>> Sing aloud to God, our strength!  Make a joyful  shout to the God of Jacob!
081:002 Raise a song, and bring here the tambourine, the pleasant lyre  with the harp.
081:003 Blow the trumpet at the New Moon, at the full moon,  on our feast day.
081:004 For it is a statute for Israel, an ordinance of the God of Jacob.
081:005 He appointed it in Joseph for a testimony, when he went out over  the land of Egypt, I heard a language that I didn't know.
081:006 "I removed his shoulder from the burden.  His hands were freed  from the basket.
081:007 You called in trouble, and I delivered you.  I answered you  in the secret place of thunder.  I tested you at the waters  of Meribah."  Selah.
081:008 "Hear, my people, and I will testify to you, Israel, if you  would listen to me!
081:009 There shall be no strange god in you, neither shall you worship  any foreign god.
081:010 I am Yahweh, your God, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt.  Open your mouth wide, and I will fill it.
081:011 But my people didn't listen to my voice.  Israel desired  none of me.
081:012 So I let them go after the stubbornness of their hearts,  that they might walk in their own counsels.
081:013 Oh that my people would listen to me, that Israel would walk  in my ways!
081:014 I would soon subdue their enemies, and turn my hand  against their adversaries.
081:015 The haters of Yahweh would cringe before him, and their punishment  would last forever.
081:016 But he would have also fed them with the finest of the wheat.  I will satisfy you with honey out of the rock."
082:001 <<A Psalm by Asaph.>> God presides in the great assembly.  He judges among the gods.
082:002 "How long will you judge unjustly, and show partiality  to the wicked?"  Selah.
082:003 "Defend the weak, the poor, and the fatherless.  Maintain the rights of the poor and oppressed.
082:004 Rescue the weak and needy.  Deliver them out of the hand  of the wicked."
082:005 They don't know, neither do they understand.  They walk back and forth in darkness.  All the foundations  of the earth are shaken.
082:006 I said, "You are gods, all of you are sons of the Most High.
082:007 Nevertheless you shall die like men, and fall like one  of the rulers."
082:008 Arise, God, judge the earth, for you inherit all of the nations.
083:001 <<A song.  A Psalm by Asaph.>> God, don't keep silent.  Don't keep silent, and don't be still, God.
083:002 For, behold, your enemies are stirred up.  Those who hate you  have lifted up their heads.
083:003 They conspire with cunning against your people.  They plot against your cherished ones.
083:004 "Come," they say, "and let's destroy them as a nation,  that the name of Israel may be remembered no more."
083:005 For they have conspired together with one mind.  They form an alliance against you.
083:006 The tents of Edom and the Ishmaelites; Moab, and the Hagrites;
083:007 Gebal, Ammon, and Amalek; Philistia with the inhabitants of Tyre;
083:008 Assyria also is joined with them.  They have helped the children  of Lot.  Selah.
083:009 Do to them as you did to Midian, as to Sisera, as to Jabin,  at the river Kishon;
083:010 who perished at Endor, who became as dung for the earth.
083:011 Make their nobles like Oreb and Zeeb; yes, all their princes  like Zebah and Zalmunna;
083:012 who said, "Let us take possession of God's pasturelands."
083:013 My God, make them like tumbleweed; like chaff before the wind.
083:014 As the fire that burns the forest, as the flame that sets  the mountains on fire,
083:015 so pursue them with your tempest, and terrify them with your storm.
083:016 Fill their faces with confusion, that they may seek  your name, Yahweh.
083:017 Let them be disappointed and dismayed forever.  Yes, let them  be confounded and perish;
083:018 that they may know that you alone, whose name is Yahweh,  are the Most High over all the earth.
084:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  On an instrument of Gath.  A Psalm by the sons of Korah.>> How lovely are your dwellings,  Yahweh of Armies!
084:002 My soul longs, and even faints for the courts of Yahweh.  My heart and my flesh cry out for the living God.
084:003 Yes, the sparrow has found a home, and the swallow a nest  for herself, where she may have her young, near your altars,  Yahweh of Armies, my King, and my God.
084:004 Blessed are those who dwell in your house.  They are always  praising you.  Selah.
084:005 Blessed are those whose strength is in you; who have set  their hearts on a pilgrimage.
084:006 Passing through the valley of Weeping, they make it a place  of springs.  Yes, the autumn rain covers it with blessings.
084:007 They go from strength to strength.  Everyone of them appears  before God in Zion.
084:008 Yahweh, God of Armies, hear my prayer.  Listen, God of Jacob.  Selah.
084:009 Behold, God our shield, look at the face of your anointed.
084:010 For a day in your courts is better than a thousand.  I would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God,  than to dwell in the tents of wickedness.
084:011 For Yahweh God is a sun and a shield.  Yahweh will give  grace and glory.  He withholds no good thing from those  who walk blamelessly.
084:012 Yahweh of Armies, blessed is the man who trusts in you.
085:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  A Psalm by the sons of Korah.>> Yahweh,  you have been favorable to your land.  You have restored  the fortunes of Jacob.
085:002 You have forgiven the iniquity of your people.  You have covered  all their sin.  Selah.
085:003 You have taken away all your wrath.  You have turned from  the fierceness of your anger.
085:004 Turn us, God of our salvation, and cause your indignation  toward us to cease.
085:005 Will you be angry with us forever?  Will you draw out your anger  to all generations?
085:006 Won't you revive us again, that your people may rejoice in you?
085:007 Show us your loving kindness, Yahweh.  Grant us your salvation.
085:008 I will hear what God, Yahweh, will speak, for he will speak  peace to his people, his saints; but let them not turn  again to folly.
085:009 Surely his salvation is near those who fear him, that glory  may dwell in our land.
085:010 Mercy and truth meet together.  Righteousness and peace have  kissed each other.
085:011 Truth springs out of the earth.  Righteousness has looked  down from heaven.
085:012 Yes, Yahweh will give that which is good.  Our land will  yield its increase.
085:013 Righteousness goes before him, And prepares the way for his steps.
086:001 <<A Prayer by David.>> Hear, Yahweh, and answer me, for I am  poor and needy.
086:002 Preserve my soul, for I am godly.  You, my God, save your  servant who trusts in you.
086:003 Be merciful to me, Lord, for I call to you all day long.
086:004 Bring joy to the soul of your servant, for to you, Lord, do I  lift up my soul.
086:005 For you, Lord, are good, and ready to forgive; abundant in loving  kindness to all those who call on you.
086:006 Hear, Yahweh, my prayer.  Listen to the voice of my petitions.
086:007 In the day of my trouble I will call on you, for you  will answer me.
086:008 There is no one like you among the gods, Lord, nor any deeds  like your deeds.
086:009 All nations you have made will come and worship before you, Lord.  They shall glorify your name.
086:010 For you are great, and do wondrous things.  You are God alone.
086:011 Teach me your way, Yahweh.  I will walk in your truth.  Make my heart undivided to fear your name.
086:012 I will praise you, Lord my God, with my whole heart.  I will glorify your name forevermore.
086:013 For your loving kindness is great toward me.  You have delivered  my soul from the lowest Sheol.
086:014 God, the proud have risen up against me.  A company of violent  men have sought after my soul, and they don't hold regard  for you before them.
086:015 But you, Lord, are a merciful and gracious God, slow to anger,  and abundant in loving kindness and truth.
086:016 Turn to me, and have mercy on me!  Give your strength to  your servant.  Save the son of your handmaid.
086:017 Show me a sign of your goodness, that those who hate me may  see it, and be shamed, because you, Yahweh, have helped me,  and comforted me.
087:001 <<A Psalm by the sons of Korah; a Song.>> His foundation  is in the holy mountains.
087:002 Yahweh loves the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob.
087:003 Glorious things are spoken about you, city of God.  Selah.
087:004 I will record Rahab{Rahab is a reference to Egypt.} and Babylon  among those who acknowledge me.  Behold, Philistia, Tyre,  and also Ethiopia:  "This one was born there."
087:005 Yes, of Zion it will be said, "This one and that one was born  in her;" the Most High himself will establish her.
087:006 Yahweh will count, when he writes up the peoples, "This one  was born there."  Selah.
087:007 Those who sing as well as those who dance say, "All my springs  are in you."
088:001 <<A Song.  A Psalm by the sons of Korah.  For the Chief Musician.  To the tune of "The Suffering of Affliction."  A contemplation  by Heman, the Ezrahite.>> Yahweh, the God of my salvation,  I have cried day and night before you.
088:002 Let my prayer enter into your presence.  Turn your ear to my cry.
088:003 For my soul is full of troubles.  My life draws near to Sheol.
088:004 I am counted among those who go down into the pit.  I am like a man who has no help,
088:005 set apart among the dead, like the slain who lie in the grave,  whom you remember no more.  They are cut off from your hand.
088:006 You have laid me in the lowest pit, in the darkest depths.
088:007 Your wrath lies heavily on me.  You have afflicted me with all  your waves.  Selah.
088:008 You have taken my friends from me.  You have made me an abomination  to them.  I am confined, and I can't escape.
088:009 My eyes are dim from grief.  I have called on you daily, Yahweh.  I have spread out my hands to you.
088:010 Do you show wonders to the dead?  Do the dead rise up and  praise you?  Selah.
088:011 Is your loving kindness declared in the grave?  Or your faithfulness in Destruction?
088:012 Are your wonders made known in the dark?  Or your righteousness  in the land of forgetfulness?
088:013 But to you, Yahweh, I have cried.  In the morning, my prayer  comes before you.
088:014 Yahweh, why do you reject my soul?  Why do you hide your  face from me?
088:015 I am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up.  While I suffer your terrors, I am distracted.
088:016 Your fierce wrath has gone over me.  Your terrors have cut me off.
088:017 They came around me like water all day long.  They completely engulfed me.
088:018 You have put lover and friend far from me, and my  friends into darkness.
089:001 <<A contemplation by Ethan, the Ezrahite.>> I will sing  of the loving kindness of Yahweh forever.  With my mouth,  I will make known your faithfulness to all generations.
089:002 I indeed declare, "Love stands firm forever.  You established  the heavens.  Your faithfulness is in them."
089:003 "I have made a covenant with my chosen one, I have sworn  to David, my servant,
089:004 'I will establish your seed forever, and build up your throne  to all generations.'"  Selah.
089:005 The heavens will praise your wonders, Yahweh; your faithfulness  also in the assembly of the holy ones.
089:006 For who in the skies can be compared to Yahweh?  Who among  the sons of the heavenly beings is like Yahweh,
089:007 a very awesome God in the council of the holy ones, to be feared  above all those who are around him?
089:008 Yahweh, God of Armies, who is a mighty one, like you?  Yah, your faithfulness is around you.
089:009 You rule the pride of the sea.  When its waves rise up,  you calm them.
089:010 You have broken Rahab in pieces, like one of the slain.  You have scattered your enemies with your mighty arm.
089:011 The heavens are yours.  The earth also is yours; the world  and its fullness.  You have founded them.
089:012 The north and the south, you have created them.  Tabor and Hermon rejoice in your name.
089:013 You have a mighty arm.  Your hand is strong, and your right  hand is exalted.
089:014 Righteousness and justice are the foundation of your throne.  Loving kindness and truth go before your face.
089:015 Blessed are the people who learn to acclaim you.  They walk in the light of your presence, Yahweh.
089:016 In your name they rejoice all day.  In your righteousness,  they are exalted.
089:017 For you are the glory of their strength.  In your favor,  our horn will be exalted.
089:018 For our shield belongs to Yahweh; our king to the Holy One of Israel.
089:019 Then you spoke in vision to your saints, and said, "I have  bestowed strength on the warrior.  I have exalted a young  man from the people.
089:020 I have found David, my servant.  I have anointed him with  my holy oil,
089:021 with whom my hand shall be established.  My arm will  also strengthen him.
089:022 No enemy will tax him.  No wicked man will oppress him.
089:023 I will beat down his adversaries before him, and strike  those who hate him.
089:024 But my faithfulness and my loving kindness will be with him.  In my name, his horn will be exalted.
089:025 I will set his hand also on the sea, and his right hand  on the rivers.
089:026 He will call to me, 'You are my Father, my God, and the rock  of my salvation!'
089:027 I will also appoint him my firstborn, the highest of the kings  of the earth.
089:028 I will keep my loving kindness for him forevermore.  My covenant will stand firm with him.
089:029 I will also make his seed endure forever, and his throne  as the days of heaven.
089:030 If his children forsake my law, and don't walk in my ordinances;
089:031 if they break my statutes, and don't keep my commandments;
089:032 then I will punish their sin with the rod, and their  iniquity with stripes.
089:033 But I will not completely take my loving kindness from him,  nor allow my faithfulness to fail.
089:034 I will not break my covenant, nor alter what my lips have uttered.
089:035 Once have I sworn by my holiness, I will not lie to David.
089:036 His seed will endure forever, his throne like the sun before me.
089:037 It will be established forever like the moon, the faithful  witness in the sky."  Selah.
089:038 But you have rejected and spurned.  You have been angry  with your anointed.
089:039 You have renounced the covenant of your servant.  You have defiled his crown in the dust.
089:040 You have broken down all his hedges.  You have brought his  strongholds to ruin.
089:041 All who pass by the way rob him.  He has become a reproach  to his neighbors.
089:042 You have exalted the right hand of his adversaries.  You have made all of his enemies rejoice.
089:043 Yes, you turn back the edge of his sword, and haven't supported  him in battle.
089:044 You have ended his splendor, and thrown his throne down  to the ground.
089:045 You have shortened the days of his youth.  You have covered  him with shame.  Selah.
089:046 How long, Yahweh?  Will you hide yourself forever?  Will your wrath burn like fire?
089:047 Remember how short my time is!  For what vanity have you  created all the children of men!
089:048 What man is he who shall live and not see death, who shall  deliver his soul from the power of Sheol?  Selah.
089:049 Lord, where are your former loving kindnesses, which you swore  to David in your faithfulness?
089:050 Remember, Lord, the reproach of your servants, how I bear  in my heart the taunts of all the mighty peoples,
089:051 With which your enemies have mocked, Yahweh, with which they  have mocked the footsteps of your anointed one.
089:052 Blessed be Yahweh forevermore.  Amen, and Amen.
090:001 <<A Prayer by Moses, the man of God.>> Lord, you have been  our dwelling place for all generations.
090:002 Before the mountains were brought forth, before you had formed  the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting,  you are God.
090:003 You turn man to destruction, saying, "Return, you children of men."
090:004 For a thousand years in your sight are just like yesterday  when it is past, like a watch in the night.
090:005 You sweep them away as they sleep.  In the morning they sprout  like new grass.
090:006 In the morning it sprouts and springs up.  By evening,  it is withered and dry.
090:007 For we are consumed in your anger.  We are troubled in your wrath.
090:008 You have set our iniquities before you, our secret sins  in the light of your presence.
090:009 For all our days have passed away in your wrath.  We bring our years to an end as a sigh.
090:010 The days of our years are seventy, or even by reason of strength  eighty years; yet their pride is but labor and sorrow,  for it passes quickly, and we fly away.
090:011 Who knows the power of your anger, your wrath according  to the fear that is due to you?
090:012 So teach us to number our days, that we may gain a heart of wisdom.
090:013 Relent, Yahweh!  How long?  Have compassion on your servants!
090:014 Satisfy us in the morning with your loving kindness, that we  may rejoice and be glad all our days.
090:015 Make us glad for as many days as you have afflicted us,  for as many years as we have seen evil.
090:016 Let your work appear to your servants; your glory to their children.
090:017 Let the favor of the Lord our God be on us; establish the work  of our hands for us; yes, establish the work of our hands.
091:001 He who dwells in the secret place of the Most High will rest  in the shadow of the Almighty.
091:002 I will say of Yahweh, "He is my refuge and my fortress;  my God, in whom I trust."
091:003 For he will deliver you from the snare of the fowler,  and from the deadly pestilence.
091:004 He will cover you with his feathers.  Under his wings you will  take refuge.  His faithfulness is your shield and rampart.
091:005 You shall not be afraid of the terror by night, nor of the arrow  that flies by day;
091:006 nor of the pestilence that walks in darkness, nor of the destruction  that wastes at noonday.
091:007 A thousand may fall at your side, and ten thousand at your  right hand; but it will not come near you.
091:008 You will only look with your eyes, and see the recompense  of the wicked.
091:009 Because you have made Yahweh your refuge, and the Most High  your dwelling place,
091:010 no evil shall happen to you, neither shall any plague come  near your dwelling.
091:011 For he will give his angels charge over you, to guard you  in all your ways.
091:012 They will bear you up in their hands, so that you won't dash  your foot against a stone.
091:013 You will tread on the lion and cobra.  You will trample  the young lion and the serpent underfoot.
091:014 "Because he has set his love on me, therefore I will deliver him.  I will set him on high, because he has known my name.
091:015 He will call on me, and I will answer him.  I will be with him  in trouble.  I will deliver him, and honor him.
091:016 I will satisfy him with long life, and show him my salvation."
092:001 <<A Psalm.  A song for the Sabbath day.>> It is a good thing  to give thanks to Yahweh, to sing praises to your name, Most High;
092:002 to proclaim your loving kindness in the morning, and your  faithfulness every night,
092:003 with the ten-stringed lute, with the harp, and with the melody  of the lyre.
092:004 For you, Yahweh, have made me glad through your work.  I will triumph in the works of your hands.
092:005 How great are your works, Yahweh!  Your thoughts are very deep.
092:006 A senseless man doesn't know, neither does a fool understand this:
092:007 though the wicked spring up as the grass, and all the evil-doers  flourish, they will be destroyed forever.
092:008 But you, Yahweh, are on high forevermore.
092:009 For, behold, your enemies, Yahweh, for, behold, your enemies  shall perish.  All the evil-doers will be scattered.
092:010 But you have exalted my horn like that of the wild ox.  I am anointed with fresh oil.
092:011 My eye has also seen my enemies.  My ears have heard of the wicked  enemies who rise up against me.
092:012 The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree.  He will grow like a cedar in Lebanon.
092:013 They are planted in Yahweh's house.  They will flourish  in our God's courts.
092:014 They will still bring forth fruit in old age.  They will be  full of sap and green,
092:015 to show that Yahweh is upright.  He is my rock, and there  is no unrighteousness in him.
093:001 Yahweh reigns!  He is clothed with majesty!  Yahweh is  armed with strength.  The world also is established.  It can't be moved.
093:002 Your throne is established from long ago.  You are from everlasting.
093:003 The floods have lifted up, Yahweh, the floods have lifted up  their voice.  The floods lift up their waves.
093:004 Above the voices of many waters, the mighty breakers of the sea,  Yahweh on high is mighty.
093:005 Your statutes stand firm.  Holiness adorns your house,  Yahweh, forevermore.
094:001 Yahweh, you God to whom vengeance belongs, you God to whom  vengeance belongs, shine forth.
094:002 Rise up, you judge of the earth.  Pay back the proud  what they deserve.
094:003 Yahweh, how long will the wicked, how long will the wicked triumph?
094:004 They pour out arrogant words.  All the evil-doers boast.
094:005 They break your people in pieces, Yahweh, and afflict your heritage.
094:006 They kill the widow and the alien, and murder the fatherless.
094:007 They say, "Yah will not see, neither will Jacob's God consider."
094:008 Consider, you senseless among the people; you fools,  when will you be wise?
094:009 He who implanted the ear, won't he hear?  He who formed the eye,  won't he see?
094:010 He who disciplines the nations, won't he punish?  He who teaches man knows.
094:011 Yahweh knows the thoughts of man, that they are futile.
094:012 Blessed is the man whom you discipline, Yah, and teach out  of your law;
094:013 that you may give him rest from the days of adversity,  until the pit is dug for the wicked.
094:014 For Yahweh won't reject his people, neither will he  forsake his inheritance.
094:015 For judgment will return to righteousness.  All the upright  in heart shall follow it.
094:016 Who will rise up for me against the wicked?  Who will stand  up for me against the evil-doers?
094:017 Unless Yahweh had been my help, my soul would have soon  lived in silence.
094:018 When I said, "My foot is slipping!"  Your loving kindness,  Yahweh, held me up.
094:019 In the multitude of my thoughts within me, your comforts  delight my soul.
094:020 Shall the throne of wickedness have fellowship with you,  which brings about mischief by statute?
094:021 They gather themselves together against the soul of the righteous,  and condemn the innocent blood.
094:022 But Yahweh has been my high tower, my God, the rock of my refuge.
094:023 He has brought on them their own iniquity, and will cut them off  in their own wickedness.  Yahweh, our God, will cut them off.
095:001 Oh come, let's sing to Yahweh.  Let's shout aloud to the rock  of our salvation!
095:002 Let's come before his presence with thanksgiving.  Let's extol him with songs!
095:003 For Yahweh is a great God, a great King above all gods.
095:004 In his hand are the deep places of the earth.  The heights  of the mountains are also his.
095:005 The sea is his, and he made it.  His hands formed the dry land.
095:006 Oh come, let's worship and bow down.  Let's kneel  before Yahweh, our Maker,
095:007 for he is our God.  We are the people of his pasture, and the sheep  in his care.  Today, oh that you would hear his voice!
095:008 Don't harden your heart, as at Meribah, as in the day of Massah  in the wilderness,
095:009 when your fathers tempted me, tested me, and saw my work.
095:010 Forty long years I was grieved with that generation,  and said, "It is a people that errs in their heart.  They have not known my ways."
095:011 Therefore I swore in my wrath, "They won't enter into my rest."
096:001 Sing to Yahweh a new song!  Sing to Yahweh, all the earth.
096:002 Sing to Yahweh!  Bless his name!  Proclaim his salvation  from day to day!
096:003 Declare his glory among the nations, his marvelous works among  all the peoples.
096:004 For great is Yahweh, and greatly to be praised!  He is to be feared above all gods.
096:005 For all the gods of the peoples are idols, but Yahweh  made the heavens.
096:006 Honor and majesty are before him.  Strength and beauty are  in his sanctuary.
096:007 Ascribe to Yahweh, you families of nations, ascribe to Yahweh  glory and strength.
096:008 Ascribe to Yahweh the glory due to his name.  Bring an offering,  and come into his courts.
096:009 Worship Yahweh in holy array.  Tremble before him, all the earth.
096:010 Say among the nations, "Yahweh reigns."  The world is  also established.  It can't be moved.  He will judge  the peoples with equity.
096:011 Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice.  Let the sea roar, and its fullness!
096:012 Let the field and all that is in it exult!  Then all the trees  of the woods shall sing for joy
096:013 before Yahweh; for he comes, for he comes to judge the earth.  He will judge the world with righteousness, the peoples  with his truth.
097:001 Yahweh reigns!  Let the earth rejoice!  Let the multitude  of islands be glad!
097:002 Clouds and darkness are around him.  Righteousness and justice  are the foundation of his throne.
097:003 A fire goes before him, and burns up his adversaries on every side.
097:004 His lightning lights up the world.  The earth sees, and trembles.
097:005 The mountains melt like wax at the presence of Yahweh,  at the presence of the Lord of the whole earth.
097:006 The heavens declare his righteousness.  All the peoples have  seen his glory.
097:007 Let all them be shamed who serve engraved images, who boast  in their idols.  Worship him, all you gods!
097:008 Zion heard and was glad.  The daughters of Judah rejoiced,  because of your judgments, Yahweh.
097:009 For you, Yahweh, are most high above all the earth.  You are exalted far above all gods.
097:010 You who love Yahweh, hate evil.  He preserves the souls of  his saints.  He delivers them out of the hand of the wicked.
097:011 Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the  upright in heart.
097:012 Be glad in Yahweh, you righteous people!  Give thanks to  his holy Name.
098:001 <<A Psalm.>> Sing to Yahweh a new song, for he has done  marvelous things!  His right hand, and his holy arm,  have worked salvation for him.
098:002 Yahweh has made known his salvation.  He has openly shown  his righteousness in the sight of the nations.
098:003 He has remembered his loving kindness and his faithfulness  toward the house of Israel.  All the ends of the earth have  seen the salvation of our God.
098:004 Make a joyful noise to Yahweh, all the earth!  Burst out and sing  for joy, yes, sing praises!
098:005 Sing praises to Yahweh with the harp, with the harp and  the voice of melody.
098:006 With trumpets and sound of the ram's horn, make a joyful noise  before the King, Yahweh.
098:007 Let the sea roar with its fullness; the world, and those  who dwell therein.
098:008 Let the rivers clap their hands.  Let the mountains sing  for joy together.
098:009 Let them sing before Yahweh, for he comes to judge the earth.  He will judge the world with righteousness, and the  peoples with equity.
099:001 Yahweh reigns!  Let the peoples tremble.  He sits enthroned  among the cherubim.  Let the earth be moved.
099:002 Yahweh is great in Zion.  He is high above all the peoples.
099:003 Let them praise your great and awesome name.  He is Holy!
099:004 The King's strength also loves justice.  You do establish equity.  You execute justice and righteousness in Jacob.
099:005 Exalt Yahweh our God.  Worship at his footstool.  He is Holy!
099:006 Moses and Aaron were among his priests, Samuel among those who call  on his name; they called on Yahweh, and he answered them.
099:007 He spoke to them in the pillar of cloud.  They kept his testimonies,  the statute that he gave them.
099:008 You answered them, Yahweh our God.  You are a God who forgave them,  although you took vengeance for their doings.
099:009 Exalt Yahweh, our God.  Worship at his holy hill, for Yahweh,  our God, is holy!
100:001 <<A Psalm of thanksgiving.>> Shout for joy to Yahweh,  all you lands!
100:002 Serve Yahweh with gladness.  Come before his presence with singing.
100:003 Know that Yahweh, he is God.  It is he who has made us, and we  are his.  We are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.
100:004 Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, into his courts with praise.  Give thanks to him, and bless his name.
100:005 For Yahweh is good.  His loving kindness endures forever,  his faithfulness to all generations.
101:001 <<A Psalm by David.>> I will sing of loving kindness and justice.  To you, Yahweh, I will sing praises.
101:002 I will be careful to live a blameless life.  When will you come  to me?  I will walk within my house with a blameless heart.
101:003 I will set no vile thing before my eyes.  I hate the deeds  of faithless men.  They will not cling to me.
101:004 A perverse heart will be far from me.  I will have nothing  to do with evil.
101:005 I will silence whoever secretly slanders his neighbor.  I won't tolerate one who is haughty and conceited.
101:006 My eyes will be on the faithful of the land, that they may dwell  with me.  He who walks in a perfect way, he will serve me.
101:007 He who practices deceit won't dwell within my house.  He who speaks falsehood won't be established before my eyes.
101:008 Morning by morning, I will destroy all the wicked of the land;  to cut off all the workers of iniquity from Yahweh's city.
102:001 <<A Prayer of the afflicted, when he is overwhelmed and pours out  his complaint before Yahweh.>> Hear my prayer, Yahweh!  Let my  cry come to you.
102:002 Don't hide your face from me in the day of my distress.  Turn your ear to me.  Answer me quickly in the day when I call.
102:003 For my days consume away like smoke.  My bones are burned  as a firebrand.
102:004 My heart is blighted like grass, and withered, for I forget  to eat my bread.
102:005 By reason of the voice of my groaning, my bones stick to my skin.
102:006 I am like a pelican of the wilderness.  I have become as an owl  of the waste places.
102:007 I watch, and have become like a sparrow that is alone  on the housetop.
102:008 My enemies reproach me all day.  Those who are mad at me use  my name as a curse.
102:009 For I have eaten ashes like bread, and mixed my drink with tears,
102:010 Because of your indignation and your wrath, for you have taken  me up, and thrown me away.
102:011 My days are like a long shadow.  I have withered like grass.
102:012 But you, Yahweh, will abide forever; your renown endures  to all generations.
102:013 You will arise and have mercy on Zion; for it is time to have  pity on her.  Yes, the set time has come.
102:014 For your servants take pleasure in her stones, and have pity  on her dust.
102:015 So the nations will fear the name of Yahweh; all the kings  of the earth your glory.
102:016 For Yahweh has built up Zion.  He has appeared in his glory.
102:017 He has responded to the prayer of the destitute, and has not  despised their prayer.
102:018 This will be written for the generation to come.  A people which will be created will praise Yah.
102:019 For he has looked down from the height of his sanctuary.  From heaven, Yahweh saw the earth;
102:020 to hear the groans of the prisoner; to free those who are  condemned to death;
102:021 that men may declare the name of Yahweh in Zion, and his  praise in Jerusalem;
102:022 when the peoples are gathered together, the kingdoms,  to serve Yahweh.
102:023 He weakened my strength along the course.  He shortened my days.
102:024 I said, "My God, don't take me away in the midst of my days.  Your years are throughout all generations.
102:025 Of old, you laid the foundation of the earth.  The heavens  are the work of your hands.
102:026 They will perish, but you will endure.  Yes, all of them will  wear out like a garment.  You will change them like a cloak,  and they will be changed.
102:027 But you are the same.  Your years will have no end.
102:028 The children of your servants will continue.  Their seed  will be established before you."
103:001 <<By David.>> Praise Yahweh, my soul!  All that is within me,  praise his holy name!
103:002 Praise Yahweh, my soul, and don't forget all his benefits;
103:003 who forgives all your sins; who heals all your diseases;
103:004 who redeems your life from destruction; who crowns you with  loving kindness and tender mercies;
103:005 who satisfies your desire with good things, so that your youth  is renewed like the eagle's.
103:006 Yahweh executes righteous acts, and justice for all  who are oppressed.
103:007 He made known his ways to Moses, his deeds to the children of Israel.
103:008 Yahweh is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abundant  in loving kindness.
103:009 He will not always accuse; neither will he stay angry forever.
103:010 He has not dealt with us according to our sins, nor repaid us  for our iniquities.
103:011 For as the heavens are high above the earth, so great is his  loving kindness toward those who fear him.
103:012 As far as the east is from the west, so far has he removed  our transgressions from us.
103:013 Like a father has compassion on his children, so Yahweh has  compassion on those who fear him.
103:014 For he knows how we are made.  He remembers that we are dust.
103:015 As for man, his days are like grass.  As a flower of the field,  so he flourishes.
103:016 For the wind passes over it, and it is gone.  Its place  remembers it no more.
103:017 But Yahweh's loving kindness is from everlasting to everlasting  with those who fear him, his righteousness to children's children;
103:018 to those who keep his covenant, to those who remember to  obey his precepts.
103:019 Yahweh has established his throne in the heavens.  His kingdom rules over all.
103:020 Praise Yahweh, you angels of his, who are mighty in strength,  who fulfill his word, obeying the voice of his word.
103:021 Praise Yahweh, all you armies of his, you servants of his,  who do his pleasure.
103:022 Praise Yahweh, all you works of his, in all places of his dominion.  Praise Yahweh, my soul!
104:001 Bless Yahweh, my soul.  Yahweh, my God, you are very great.  You are clothed with honor and majesty.
104:002 He covers himself with light as with a garment.  He stretches out the heavens like a curtain.
104:003 He lays the beams of his chambers in the waters.  He makes the clouds his chariot.  He walks on the wings  of the wind.
104:004 He makes his messengers{or, angels} winds; his servants  flames of fire.
104:005 He laid the foundations of the earth, that it should not  be moved forever.
104:006 You covered it with the deep as with a cloak.  The waters  stood above the mountains.
104:007 At your rebuke they fled.  At the voice of your thunder  they hurried away.
104:008 The mountains rose, the valleys sank down, to the place  which you had assigned to them.
104:009 You have set a boundary that they may not pass over;  that they don't turn again to cover the earth.
104:010 He sends forth springs into the valleys.  They run  among the mountains.
104:011 They give drink to every animal of the field.  The wild donkeys  quench their thirst.
104:012 The birds of the sky nest by them.  They sing among the branches.
104:013 He waters the mountains from his chambers.  The earth is filled  with the fruit of your works.
104:014 He causes the grass to grow for the livestock, and plants for man  to cultivate, that he may bring forth food out of the earth:
104:015 wine that makes glad the heart of man, oil to make his face  to shine, and bread that strengthens man's heart.
104:016 Yahweh's trees are well watered, the cedars of Lebanon,  which he has planted;
104:017 where the birds make their nests.  The stork makes its home  in the fir trees.
104:018 The high mountains are for the wild goats.  The rocks are  a refuge for the rock badgers.
104:019 He appointed the moon for seasons.  The sun knows when to set.
104:020 You make darkness, and it is night, in which all the animals  of the forest prowl.
104:021 The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their  food from God.
104:022 The sun rises, and they steal away, and lay down in their dens.
104:023 Man goes forth to his work, to his labor until the evening.
104:024 Yahweh, how many are your works!  In wisdom have you made them all.  The earth is full of your riches.
104:025 There is the sea, great and wide, in which are innumerable  living things, both small and large animals.
104:026 There the ships go, and leviathan, whom you formed to play there.
104:027 These all wait for you, that you may give them their food  in due season.
104:028 You give to them; they gather.  You open your hand;  they are satisfied with good.
104:029 You hide your face:  they are troubled; you take away their breath:  they die, and return to the dust.
104:030 You send forth your Spirit:  they are created.  You renew  the face of the ground.
104:031 Let the glory of Yahweh endure forever.  Let Yahweh rejoice  in his works.
104:032 He looks at the earth, and it trembles.  He touches the mountains,  and they smoke.
104:033 I will sing to Yahweh as long as I live.  I will sing praise  to my God while I have any being.
104:034 Let your meditation be sweet to him.  I will rejoice in Yahweh.
104:035 Let sinners be consumed out of the earth.  Let the wicked be no more.  Bless Yahweh, my soul.  Praise Yah!
105:001 Give thanks to Yahweh!  Call on his name!  Make his doings  known among the peoples.
105:002 Sing to him, sing praises to him!  Tell of all his marvelous works.
105:003 Glory in his holy name.  Let the heart of those who  seek Yahweh rejoice.
105:004 Seek Yahweh and his strength.  Seek his face forever more.
105:005 Remember his marvelous works that he has done; his wonders,  and the judgments of his mouth,
105:006 you seed of Abraham, his servant, you children of Jacob,  his chosen ones.
105:007 He is Yahweh, our God.  His judgments are in all the earth.
105:008 He has remembered his covenant forever, the word which he commanded  to a thousand generations,
105:009 the covenant which he made with Abraham, his oath to Isaac,
105:010 and confirmed the same to Jacob for a statute; to Israel  for an everlasting covenant,
105:011 saying, "To you I will give the land of Canaan, the lot  of your inheritance;"
105:012 when they were but a few men in number, yes, very few,  and foreigners in it.
105:013 They went about from nation to nation, from one kingdom  to another people.
105:014 He allowed no one to do them wrong.  Yes, he reproved kings  for their sakes,
105:015 "Don't touch my anointed ones!  Do my prophets no harm!"
105:016 He called for a famine on the land.  He destroyed the food supplies.
105:017 He sent a man before them.  Joseph was sold for a slave.
105:018 They bruised his feet with shackles.  His neck was locked in irons,
105:019 until the time that his word happened, and Yahweh's word  proved him true.
105:020 The king sent and freed him; even the ruler of peoples,  and let him go free.
105:021 He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all of his possessions;
105:022 to discipline his princes at his pleasure, and to teach  his elders wisdom.
105:023 Israel also came into Egypt.  Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.
105:024 He increased his people greatly, and made them stronger  than their adversaries.
105:025 He turned their heart to hate his people, to conspire  against his servants.
105:026 He sent Moses, his servant, and Aaron, whom he had chosen.
105:027 They performed miracles among them, and wonders in the land of Ham.
105:028 He sent darkness, and made it dark.  They didn't rebel  against his words.
105:029 He turned their waters into blood, and killed their fish.
105:030 Their land swarmed with frogs, even in the chambers of their kings.
105:031 He spoke, and swarms of flies came, and lice in all their borders.
105:032 He gave them hail for rain, with lightning in their land.
105:033 He struck their vines and also their fig trees, and shattered  the trees of their country.
105:034 He spoke, and the locusts came, and the grasshoppers, without number,
105:035 ate up every plant in their land; and ate up the fruit  of their ground.
105:036 He struck also all the firstborn in their land, the first fruits  of all their manhood.
105:037 He brought them forth with silver and gold.  There was not  one feeble person among his tribes.
105:038 Egypt was glad when they departed, for the fear of them had  fallen on them.
105:039 He spread a cloud for a covering, fire to give light in the night.
105:040 They asked, and he brought quails, and satisfied them with  the bread of the sky.
105:041 He opened the rock, and waters gushed out.  They ran as a river  in the dry places.
105:042 For he remembered his holy word, and Abraham, his servant.
105:043 He brought forth his people with joy, his chosen with singing.
105:044 He gave them the lands of the nations.  They took the labor  of the peoples in possession,
105:045 that they might keep his statutes, and observe his laws.  Praise Yah!
106:001 Praise Yahweh!  Give thanks to Yahweh, for he is good,  for his loving kindness endures forever.
106:002 Who can utter the mighty acts of Yahweh, or fully declare  all his praise?
106:003 Blessed are those who keep justice.  Blessed is one who does  what is right at all times.
106:004 Remember me, Yahweh, with the favor that you show to your people.  Visit me with your salvation,
106:005 that I may see the prosperity of your chosen, that I may  rejoice in the gladness of your nation, that I may glory  with your inheritance.
106:006 We have sinned with our fathers.  We have committed iniquity.  We have done wickedly.
106:007 Our fathers didn't understand your wonders in Egypt.  They didn't  remember the multitude of your loving kindnesses, but were  rebellious at the sea, even at the Red Sea{or, Sea of Reeds}.
106:008 Nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake, that he might  make his mighty power known.
106:009 He rebuked the Red Sea{or, Sea of Reeds} also, and it was dried up;  so he led them through the depths, as through a desert.
106:010 He saved them from the hand of him who hated them, and redeemed  them from the hand of the enemy.
106:011 The waters covered their adversaries.  There was not one  of them left.
106:012 Then they believed his words.  They sang his praise.
106:013 They soon forgot his works.  They didn't wait for his counsel,
106:014 but gave in to craving in the desert, and tested God  in the wasteland.
106:015 He gave them their request, but sent leanness into their soul.
106:016 They envied Moses also in the camp, and Aaron, Yahweh's saint.
106:017 The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered  the company of Abiram.
106:018 A fire was kindled in their company.  The flame burned  up the wicked.
106:019 They made a calf in Horeb, and worshiped a molten image.
106:020 Thus they exchanged their glory for an image of a bull  that eats grass.
106:021 They forgot God, their Savior, who had done great things in Egypt,
106:022 Wondrous works in the land of Ham, and awesome things by  the Red Sea{or, Sea of Reeds}.
106:023 Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had Moses,  his chosen, not stood before him in the breach, to turn away  his wrath, so that he wouldn't destroy them.
106:024 Yes, they despised the pleasant land.  They didn't believe his word,
106:025 but murmured in their tents, and didn't listen to Yahweh's voice.
106:026 Therefore he swore to them that he would overthrow them  in the wilderness,
106:027 that he would overthrow their seed among the nations,  and scatter them in the lands.
106:028 They joined themselves also to Baal Peor, and ate the sacrifices  of the dead.
106:029 Thus they provoked him to anger with their deeds.  The plague broke in on them.
106:030 Then Phinehas stood up, and executed judgment, so the  plague was stopped.
106:031 That was credited to him for righteousness, for all  generations to come.
106:032 They angered him also at the waters of Meribah, so that Moses  was troubled for their sakes;
106:033 because they were rebellious against his spirit, he spoke  rashly with his lips.
106:034 They didn't destroy the peoples, as Yahweh commanded them,
106:035 but mixed themselves with the nations, and learned their works.
106:036 They served their idols, which became a snare to them.
106:037 Yes, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters to demons.
106:038 They shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of  their daughters, whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan.  The land was polluted with blood.
106:039 Thus were they defiled with their works, and prostituted  themselves in their deeds.
106:040 Therefore Yahweh burned with anger against his people.  He abhorred his inheritance.
106:041 He gave them into the hand of the nations.  Those who hated  them ruled over them.
106:042 Their enemies also oppressed them.  They were brought into  subjection under their hand.
106:043 Many times he delivered them, but they were rebellious  in their counsel, and were brought low in their iniquity.
106:044 Nevertheless he regarded their distress, when he heard their cry.
106:045 He remembered for them his covenant, and repented according  to the multitude of his loving kindnesses.
106:046 He made them also to be pitied by all those who carried them captive.
106:047 Save us, Yahweh, our God, gather us from among the nations,  to give thanks to your holy name, to triumph in your praise!
106:048 Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel, from everlasting even  to everlasting!  Let all the people say, "Amen." Praise Yah!
107:001 Give thanks to Yahweh, for he is good, for his loving  kindness endures forever.
107:002 Let the redeemed by Yahweh say so, whom he has redeemed from  the hand of the adversary,
107:003 And gathered out of the lands, from the east and from the west,  from the north and from the south.
107:004 They wandered in the wilderness in a desert way.  They found no city to live in.
107:005 Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them.
107:006 Then they cried to Yahweh in their trouble, and he delivered  them out of their distresses,
107:007 he led them also by a straight way, that they might go to a city  to live in.
107:008 Let them praise Yahweh for his loving kindness, for his wonderful  works to the children of men!
107:009 For he satisfies the longing soul.  He fills the hungry  soul with good.
107:010 Some sat in darkness and in the shadow of death, being bound  in affliction and iron,
107:011 because they rebelled against the words of God, and condemned  the counsel of the Most High.
107:012 Therefore he brought down their heart with labor.  They fell down, and there was none to help.
107:013 Then they cried to Yahweh in their trouble, and he saved them  out of their distresses.
107:014 He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death,  and broke their bonds in sunder.
107:015 Let them praise Yahweh for his loving kindness, for his wonderful  works to the children of men!
107:016 For he has broken the gates of brass, and cut through bars of iron.
107:017 Fools are afflicted because of their disobedience, and because  of their iniquities.
107:018 Their soul abhors all kinds of food.  They draw near to  the gates of death.
107:019 Then they cry to Yahweh in their trouble, he saves them out  of their distresses.
107:020 He sends his word, and heals them, and delivers them  from their graves.
107:021 Let them praise Yahweh for his loving kindness, for his wonderful  works to the children of men!
107:022 Let them offer the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and declare  his works with singing.
107:023 Those who go down to the sea in ships, who do business  in great waters;
107:024 These see Yahweh's works, and his wonders in the deep.
107:025 For he commands, and raises the stormy wind, which lifts  up its waves.
107:026 They mount up to the sky; they go down again to the depths.  Their soul melts away because of trouble.
107:027 They reel back and forth, and stagger like a drunken man,  and are at their wits' end.
107:028 Then they cry to Yahweh in their trouble, and he brings them  out of their distress.
107:029 He makes the storm a calm, so that its waves are still.
107:030 Then they are glad because it is calm, so he brings them  to their desired haven.
107:031 Let them praise Yahweh for his loving kindness, for his wonderful  works for the children of men!
107:032 Let them exalt him also in the assembly of the people,  and praise him in the seat of the elders.
107:033 He turns rivers into a desert, water springs into a thirsty ground,
107:034 and a fruitful land into a salt waste, for the wickedness  of those who dwell in it.
107:035 He turns a desert into a pool of water, and a dry land  into water springs.
107:036 There he makes the hungry live, that they may prepare a city  to live in,
107:037 sow fields, plant vineyards, and reap the fruits of increase.
107:038 He blesses them also, so that they are multiplied greatly.  He doesn't allow their livestock to decrease.
107:039 Again, they are diminished and bowed down through oppression,  trouble, and sorrow.
107:040 He pours contempt on princes, and causes them to wander  in a trackless waste.
107:041 Yet he lifts the needy out of their affliction, and increases  their families like a flock.
107:042 The upright will see it, and be glad.  All the wicked will  shut their mouths.
107:043 Whoever is wise will pay attention to these things.  They will consider the loving kindnesses of Yahweh.
108:001 <<A Song.  A Psalm by David.>> My heart is steadfast, God.  I will sing and I will make music with my soul.
108:002 Wake up, harp and lyre!  I will wake up the dawn.
108:003 I will give thanks to you, Yahweh, among the nations.  I will sing praises to you among the peoples.
108:004 For your loving kindness is great above the heavens.  Your faithfulness reaches to the skies.
108:005 Be exalted, God, above the heavens!  Let your glory be over  all the earth.
108:006 That your beloved may be delivered, save with your right hand,  and answer us.
108:007 God has spoken from his sanctuary:  "In triumph, I will  divide Shechem, and measure out the valley of Succoth.
108:008 Gilead is mine.  Manasseh is mine.  Ephraim also is my helmet.  Judah is my scepter.
108:009 Moab is my wash pot.  I will toss my sandal on Edom.  I will shout over Philistia."
108:010 Who will bring me into the fortified city?  Who has led  me to Edom?
108:011 Haven't you rejected us, God?  You don't go forth, God,  with our armies.
108:012 Give us help against the enemy, for the help of man is vain.
108:013 Through God, we will do valiantly.  For it is he who will tread  down our enemies.
109:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  A Psalm by David.>> God of my praise,  don't remain silent,
109:002 for they have opened the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of  deceit against me.  They have spoken to me with a lying tongue.
109:003 They have also surrounded me with words of hatred, and fought  against me without a cause.
109:004 In return for my love, they are my adversaries; but I  am in prayer.
109:005 They have rewarded me evil for good, and hatred for my love.
109:006 Set a wicked man over him.  Let an adversary stand at  his right hand.
109:007 When he is judged, let him come forth guilty.  Let his prayer  be turned into sin.
109:008 Let his days be few.  Let another take his office.
109:009 Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow.
109:010 Let his children be wandering beggars.  Let them be sought  from their ruins.
109:011 Let the creditor seize all that he has.  Let strangers plunder  the fruit of his labor.
109:012 Let there be none to extend kindness to him, neither let there  be any to have pity on his fatherless children.
109:013 Let his posterity be cut off.  In the generation following  let their name be blotted out.
109:014 Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered by Yahweh.  Don't let the sin of his mother be blotted out.
109:015 Let them be before Yahweh continually, that he may cut off  the memory of them from the earth;
109:016 because he didn't remember to show kindness, but persecuted  the poor and needy man, the broken in heart, to kill them.
109:017 Yes, he loved cursing, and it came to him.  He didn't delight  in blessing, and it was far from him.
109:018 He clothed himself also with cursing as with his garment.  It came into his inward parts like water, like oil into his bones.
109:019 Let it be to him as the clothing with which he covers himself,  for the belt that is always around him.
109:020 This is the reward of my adversaries from Yahweh, of those  who speak evil against my soul.
109:021 But deal with me, Yahweh the Lord, for your name's sake,  because your loving kindness is good, deliver me;
109:022 for I am poor and needy.  My heart is wounded within me.
109:023 I fade away like an evening shadow.  I am shaken off like a locust.
109:024 My knees are weak through fasting.  My body is thin and lacks fat.
109:025 I have also become a reproach to them.  When they see me,  they shake their head.
109:026 Help me, Yahweh, my God.  Save me according to your loving kindness;
109:027 that they may know that this is your hand; that you, Yahweh,  have done it.
109:028 They may curse, but you bless.  When they arise, they will  be shamed, but your servant shall rejoice.
109:029 Let my adversaries be clothed with dishonor.  Let them cover  themselves with their own shame as with a robe.
109:030 I will give great thanks to Yahweh with my mouth.  Yes, I will  praise him among the multitude.
109:031 For he will stand at the right hand of the needy, to save him  from those who judge his soul.
110:001 <<A Psalm by David.>> Yahweh says to my Lord, "Sit at my right hand,  until I make your enemies your footstool for your feet."
110:002 Yahweh will send forth the rod of your strength out of Zion.  Rule in the midst of your enemies.
110:003 Your people offer themselves willingly in the day of your power,  in holy array.  Out of the womb of the morning, you have  the dew of your youth.
110:004 Yahweh has sworn, and will not change his mind:  "You are a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek."
110:005 The Lord is at your right hand.  He will crush kings in the day  of his wrath.
110:006 He will judge among the nations.  He will heap up dead bodies.  He will crush the ruler of the whole earth.
110:007 He will drink of the brook in the way; therefore he will lift  up his head.
111:001 Praise Yah!{Psalm 111 is an acrostic poem, with each verse  after the initial "Praise Yah!" starting with a letter of  the alphabet (ordered from Alef to Tav).} I will give thanks  to Yahweh with my whole heart, in the council of the upright,  and in the congregation.
111:002 Yahweh's works are great, pondered by all those who delight in them.
111:003 His work is honor and majesty.  His righteousness endures forever.
111:004 He has caused his wonderful works to be remembered.  Yahweh is gracious and merciful.
111:005 He has given food to those who fear him.  He always  remembers his covenant.
111:006 He has shown his people the power of his works, in giving them  the heritage of the nations.
111:007 The works of his hands are truth and justice.  All his precepts are sure.
111:008 They are established forever and ever.  They are done in  truth and uprightness.
111:009 He has sent redemption to his people.  He has ordained his  covenant forever.  His name is holy and awesome!
111:010 The fear of Yahweh is the beginning of wisdom.  All those who do his work have a good understanding.  His praise endures forever!
112:001 Praise Yah!{Psalm 112 is an acrostic poem, with each verse after  the initial "Praise Yah!" starting with a letter of the alphabet  (ordered from Alef to Tav).} Blessed is the man who fears Yahweh,  who delights greatly in his commandments.
112:002 His seed will be mighty in the land.  The generation of the upright  will be blessed.
112:003 Wealth and riches are in his house.  His righteousness  endures forever.
112:004 Light dawns in the darkness for the upright, gracious,  merciful, and righteous.
112:005 It is well with the man who deals graciously and lends.  He will maintain his cause in judgment.
112:006 For he will never be shaken.  The righteous will  be remembered forever.
112:007 He will not be afraid of evil news.  His heart is steadfast,  trusting in Yahweh.
112:008 His heart is established.  He will not be afraid in the end  when he sees his adversaries.
112:009 He has dispersed, he has given to the poor.  His righteousness  endures forever.  His horn will be exalted with honor.
112:010 The wicked will see it, and be grieved.  He shall gnash with  his teeth, and melt away.  The desire of the wicked will perish.
113:001 Praise Yah!  Praise, you servants of Yahweh, praise the  name of Yahweh.
113:002 Blessed be the name of Yahweh, from this time forth and forevermore.
113:003 From the rising of the sun to the going down of the same,  Yahweh's name is to be praised.
113:004 Yahweh is high above all nations, his glory above the heavens.
113:005 Who is like Yahweh, our God, who has his seat on high,
113:006 Who stoops down to see in heaven and in the earth?
113:007 He raises up the poor out of the dust.  Lifts up the needy  from the ash heap;
113:008 that he may set him with princes, even with the princes  of his people.
113:009 He settles the barren woman in her home, as a joyful mother  of children.  Praise Yah!
114:001 When Israel went forth out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from  a people of foreign language;
114:002 Judah became his sanctuary, Israel his dominion.
114:003 The sea saw it, and fled.  The Jordan was driven back.
114:004 The mountains skipped like rams, the little hills like lambs.
114:005 What was it, you sea, that you fled?  You Jordan,  that you turned back?
114:006 You mountains, that you skipped like rams; you little hills,  like lambs?
114:007 Tremble, you earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence  of the God of Jacob,
114:008 who turned the rock into a pool of water, the flint into  a spring of waters.
115:001 Not to us, Yahweh, not to us, but to your name give glory,  for your loving kindness, and for your truth's sake.
115:002 Why should the nations say, "Where is their God, now?"
115:003 But our God is in the heavens.  He does whatever he pleases.
115:004 Their idols are silver and gold, the work of men's hands.
115:005 They have mouths, but they don't speak.  They have eyes,  but they don't see.
115:006 They have ears, but they don't hear.  They have noses,  but they don't smell.
115:007 They have hands, but they don't feel.  They have feet, but they  don't walk, neither do they speak through their throat.
115:008 Those who make them will be like them; yes, everyone who  trusts in them.
115:009 Israel, trust in Yahweh!  He is their help and their shield.
115:010 House of Aaron, trust in Yahweh!  He is their help and their shield.
115:011 You who fear Yahweh, trust in Yahweh!  He is their help  and their shield.
115:012 Yahweh remembers us.  He will bless us.  He will bless the house  of Israel.  He will bless the house of Aaron.
115:013 He will bless those who fear Yahweh, both small and great.
115:014 May Yahweh increase you more and more, you and your children.
115:015 Blessed are you by Yahweh, who made heaven and earth.
115:016 The heavens are the heavens of Yahweh; but the earth has  he given to the children of men.
115:017 The dead don't praise Yah, neither any who go down into silence;
115:018 But we will bless Yah, from this time forth and forevermore.  Praise Yah!
116:001 I love Yahweh, because he listens to my voice, and my  cries for mercy.
116:002 Because he has turned his ear to me, therefore I will call  on him as long as I live.
116:003 The cords of death surrounded me, the pains of Sheol got a hold  of me.  I found trouble and sorrow.
116:004 Then called I on the name of Yahweh:  "Yahweh, I beg you,  deliver my soul."
116:005 Gracious is Yahweh, and righteous; yes, our God is merciful.
116:006 Yahweh preserves the simple.  I was brought low, and he saved me.
116:007 Return to your rest, my soul, for Yahweh has dealt  bountifully with you.
116:008 For you have delivered my soul from death, my eyes from tears,  and my feet from falling.
116:009 I will walk before Yahweh in the land of the living.
116:010 I believed, therefore I said, "I was greatly afflicted."
116:011 I said in my haste, "All men are liars."
116:012 What will I give to Yahweh for all his benefits toward me?
116:013 I will take the cup of salvation, and call on the name of Yahweh.
116:014 I will pay my vows to Yahweh, yes, in the presence of  all his people.
116:015 Precious in the sight of Yahweh is the death of his saints.
116:016 Yahweh, truly I am your servant.  I am your servant, the son  of your handmaid.  You have freed me from my chains.
116:017 I will offer to you the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and will  call on the name of Yahweh.
116:018 I will pay my vows to Yahweh, yes, in the presence of  all his people,
116:019 in the courts of Yahweh's house, in the midst of you, Jerusalem.  Praise Yah!
117:001 Praise Yahweh, all you nations!  Extol him, all you peoples!
117:002 For his loving kindness is great toward us.  Yahweh's faithfulness  endures forever.  Praise Yah!
118:001 Give thanks to Yahweh, for he is good, for his loving  kindness endures forever.
118:002 Let Israel now say that his loving kindness endures forever.
118:003 Let the house of Aaron now say that his loving kindness  endures forever.
118:004 Now let those who fear Yahweh say that his loving  kindness endures forever.
118:005 Out of my distress, I called on Yah.  Yah answered me with freedom.
118:006 Yahweh is on my side.  I will not be afraid.  What can man  do to me?
118:007 Yahweh is on my side among those who help me.  Therefore I  will look in triumph at those who hate me.
118:008 It is better to take refuge in Yahweh, than to put confidence in man.
118:009 It is better to take refuge in Yahweh, than to put  confidence in princes.
118:010 All the nations surrounded me, but in the name of Yahweh, I  cut them off.
118:011 They surrounded me, yes, they surrounded me.  In the name  of Yahweh I indeed cut them off.
118:012 They surrounded me like bees.  They are quenched like the  burning thorns.  In the name of Yahweh I cut them off.
118:013 You pushed me back hard, to make me fall, but Yahweh helped me.
118:014 Yah is my strength and song.  He has become my salvation.
118:015 The voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tents of  the righteous.  "The right hand of Yahweh does valiantly.
118:016 The right hand of Yahweh is exalted!  The right hand of  Yahweh does valiantly!"
118:017 I will not die, but live, and declare Yah's works.
118:018 Yah has punished me severely, but he has not given me  over to death.
118:019 Open to me the gates of righteousness.  I will enter into them.  I will give thanks to Yah.
118:020 This is the gate of Yahweh; the righteous will enter into it.
118:021 I will give thanks to you, for you have answered me, and have  become my salvation.
118:022 The stone which the builders rejected has become the head  of the corner.
118:023 This is Yahweh's doing.  It is marvelous in our eyes.
118:024 This is the day that Yahweh has made.  We will rejoice and be  glad in it!
118:025 Save us now, we beg you, Yahweh!  Yahweh, we beg you,  send prosperity now.
118:026 Blessed is he who comes in the name of Yahweh!  We have blessed  you out of the house of Yahweh.
118:027 Yahweh is God, and he has given us light.  Bind the sacrifice  with cords, even to the horns of the altar.
118:028 You are my God, and I will give thanks to you.  You are my God, I will exalt you.
118:029 Oh give thanks to Yahweh, for he is good, for his loving  kindness endures forever.
119:001 <<ALEPH>> Blessed are those whose ways are blameless,  who walk according to Yahweh's law.
119:002 Blessed are those who keep his statutes, who seek him with  their whole heart.
119:003 Yes, they do nothing wrong.  They walk in his ways.
119:004 You have commanded your precepts, that we should fully obey them.
119:005 Oh that my ways were steadfast to obey your statutes!
119:006 Then I wouldn't be disappointed, when I consider all  of your commandments.
119:007 I will give thanks to you with uprightness of heart, when I  learn your righteous judgments.
119:008 I will observe your statutes.  Don't utterly forsake me.
119:009 How can a young man keep his way pure?  By living according  to your word.
119:010 With my whole heart, I have sought you.  Don't let me wander  from your commandments.
119:011 I have hidden your word in my heart, that I might not  sin against you.
119:012 Blessed are you, Yahweh.  Teach me your statutes.
119:013 With my lips, I have declared all the ordinances of your mouth.
119:014 I have rejoiced in the way of your testimonies, as much  as in all riches.
119:015 I will meditate on your precepts, and consider your ways.
119:016 I will delight myself in your statutes.  I will not  forget your word.
119:017 Do good to your servant.  I will live and I will obey your word.
119:018 Open my eyes, that I may see wondrous things out of your law.
119:019 I am a stranger on the earth.  Don't hide your commandments from me.
119:020 My soul is consumed with longing for your ordinances at all times.
119:021 You have rebuked the proud who are cursed, who wander  from your commandments.
119:022 Take reproach and contempt away from me, for I have  kept your statutes.
119:023 Though princes sit and slander me, your servant will meditate  on your statutes.
119:024 Indeed your statutes are my delight, and my counselors.
119:025 My soul is laid low in the dust.  Revive me according  to your word!
119:026 I declared my ways, and you answered me.  Teach me your statutes.
119:027 Let me understand the teaching of your precepts!  Then I will meditate on your wondrous works.
119:028 My soul is weary with sorrow:  strengthen me according  to your word.
119:029 Keep me from the way of deceit.  Grant me your law graciously!
119:030 I have chosen the way of truth.  I have set your ordinances  before me.
119:031 I cling to your statutes, Yahweh.  Don't let me be disappointed.
119:032 I run in the path of your commandments, for you have set  my heart free.
119:033 Teach me, Yahweh, the way of your statutes.  I will keep them  to the end.
119:034 Give me understanding, and I will keep your law.  Yes, I will  obey it with my whole heart.
119:035 Direct me in the path of your commandments, for I delight in them.
119:036 Turn my heart toward your statutes, not toward selfish gain.
119:037 Turn my eyes away from looking at worthless things.  Revive me in your ways.
119:038 Fulfill your promise to your servant, that you may be feared.
119:039 Take away my disgrace that I dread, for your ordinances are good.
119:040 Behold, I long for your precepts!  Revive me in your righteousness.
119:041 Let your loving kindness also come to me, Yahweh, your salvation,  according to your word.
119:042 So I will have an answer for him who reproaches me, for I  trust in your word.
119:043 Don't snatch the word of truth out of my mouth, for I put  my hope in your ordinances.
119:044 So I will obey your law continually, forever and ever.
119:045 I will walk in liberty, for I have sought your precepts.
119:046 I will also speak of your statutes before kings, and will  not be disappointed.
119:047 I will delight myself in your commandments, because I love them.
119:048 I reach out my hands for your commandments, which I love.  I will meditate on your statutes.
119:049 Remember your word to your servant, because you gave me hope.
119:050 This is my comfort in my affliction, for your word has revived me.
119:051 The arrogant mock me excessively, but I don't swerve from your law.
119:052 I remember your ordinances of old, Yahweh, and have comforted myself.
119:053 Indignation has taken hold on me, because of the wicked  who forsake your law.
119:054 Your statutes have been my songs, in the house where I live.
119:055 I have remembered your name, Yahweh, in the night, and I  obey your law.
119:056 This is my way, that I keep your precepts.
119:057 Yahweh is my portion.  I promised to obey your words.
119:058 I sought your favor with my whole heart.  Be merciful to me  according to your word.
119:059 I considered my ways, and turned my steps to your statutes.
119:060 I will hurry, and not delay, to obey your commandments.
119:061 The ropes of the wicked bind me, but I won't forget your law.
119:062 At midnight I will rise to give thanks to you, because of  your righteous ordinances.
119:063 I am a friend of all those who fear you, of those who  observe your precepts.
119:064 The earth is full of your loving kindness, Yahweh.  Teach me your statutes.
119:065 Do good to your servant, according to your word, Yahweh.
119:066 Teach me good judgment and knowledge, for I believe  in your commandments.
119:067 Before I was afflicted, I went astray; but now I observe your word.
119:068 You are good, and do good.  Teach me your statutes.
119:069 The proud have smeared a lie upon me.  With my whole heart,  I will keep your precepts.
119:070 Their heart is as callous as the fat, but I delight in your law.
119:071 It is good for me that I have been afflicted, that I may  learn your statutes.
119:072 The law of your mouth is better to me than thousands of pieces  of gold and silver.
119:073 Your hands have made me and formed me.  Give me understanding,  that I may learn your commandments.
119:074 Those who fear you will see me and be glad, because I have put  my hope in your word.
119:075 Yahweh, I know that your judgments are righteous, that in  faithfulness you have afflicted me.
119:076 Please let your loving kindness be for my comfort, according to  your word to your servant.
119:077 Let your tender mercies come to me, that I may live;  for your law is my delight.
119:078 Let the proud be disappointed, for they have overthrown  me wrongfully.  I will meditate on your precepts.
119:079 Let those who fear you turn to me.  They will know your statutes.
119:080 Let my heart be blameless toward your decrees, that I may  not be disappointed.
119:081 My soul faints for your salvation.  I hope in your word.
119:082 My eyes fail for your word.  I say, "When will you comfort me?"
119:083 For I have become like a wineskin in the smoke.  I don't forget your statutes.
119:084 How many are the days of your servant?  When will you execute  judgment on those who persecute me?
119:085 The proud have dug pits for me, contrary to your law.
119:086 All of your commandments are faithful.  They persecute  me wrongfully.  Help me!
119:087 They had almost wiped me from the earth, but I didn't  forsake your precepts.
119:088 Preserve my life according to your loving kindness, so I  will obey the statutes of your mouth.
119:089 Yahweh, your word is settled in heaven forever.
119:090 Your faithfulness is to all generations.  You have established  the earth, and it remains.
119:091 Your laws remain to this day, for all things serve you.
119:092 Unless your law had been my delight, I would have perished  in my affliction.
119:093 I will never forget your precepts, for with them,  you have revived me.
119:094 I am yours.  Save me, for I have sought your precepts.
119:095 The wicked have waited for me, to destroy me.  I will consider your statutes.
119:096 I have seen a limit to all perfection, but your commands  are boundless.
119:097 How I love your law!  It is my meditation all day.
119:098 Your commandments make me wiser than my enemies, for your  commandments are always with me.
119:099 I have more understanding than all my teachers, for your  testimonies are my meditation.
119:100 I understand more than the aged, because I have kept your precepts.
119:101 I have kept my feet from every evil way, that I might  observe your word.
119:102 I have not turned aside from your ordinances, for you  have taught me.
119:103 How sweet are your promises to my taste, more than honey  to my mouth!
119:104 Through your precepts, I get understanding; therefore I hate  every false way.
119:105 Your word is a lamp to my feet, and a light for my path.
119:106 I have sworn, and have confirmed it, that I will obey  your righteous ordinances.
119:107 I am afflicted very much.  Revive me, Yahweh, according to your word.
119:108 Accept, I beg you, the willing offerings of my mouth.  Yahweh, teach me your ordinances.
119:109 My soul is continually in my hand, yet I won't forget your law.
119:110 The wicked have laid a snare for me, yet I haven't gone astray  from your precepts.
119:111 I have taken your testimonies as a heritage forever, for they  are the joy of my heart.
119:112 I have set my heart to perform your statutes forever,  even to the end.
119:113 I hate double-minded men, but I love your law.
119:114 You are my hiding place and my shield.  I hope in your word.
119:115 Depart from me, you evildoers, that I may keep the commandments  of my God.
119:116 Uphold me according to your word, that I may live.  Let me not be ashamed of my hope.
119:117 Hold me up, and I will be safe, and will have respect for  your statutes continually.
119:118 You reject all those who stray from your statutes, for their  deceit is in vain.
119:119 You put away all the wicked of the earth like dross.  Therefore I love your testimonies.
119:120 My flesh trembles for fear of you.  I am afraid of your judgments.
119:121 I have done what is just and righteous.  Don't leave me  to my oppressors.
119:122 Ensure your servant's well-being. Don't let the proud oppress me.
119:123 My eyes fail looking for your salvation, for your righteous word.
119:124 Deal with your servant according to your loving kindness.  Teach me your statutes.
119:125 I am your servant.  Give me understanding, that I may  know your testimonies.
119:126 It is time to act, Yahweh, for they break your law.
119:127 Therefore I love your commandments more than gold, yes,  more than pure gold.
119:128 Therefore I consider all of your precepts to be right.  I hate every false way.
119:129 Your testimonies are wonderful, therefore my soul keeps them.
119:130 The entrance of your words gives light.  It gives understanding  to the simple.
119:131 I opened my mouth wide and panted, for I longed  for your commandments.
119:132 Turn to me, and have mercy on me, as you always do to those  who love your name.
119:133 Establish my footsteps in your word.  Don't let any iniquity  have dominion over me.
119:134 Redeem me from the oppression of man, so I will observe  your precepts.
119:135 Make your face shine on your servant.  Teach me your statutes.
119:136 Streams of tears run down my eyes, because they don't  observe your law.
119:137 You are righteous, Yahweh.  Your judgments are upright.
119:138 You have commanded your statutes in righteousness.  They are fully trustworthy.
119:139 My zeal wears me out, because my enemies ignore your words.
119:140 Your promises have been thoroughly tested, and your  servant loves them.
119:141 I am small and despised.  I don't forget your precepts.
119:142 Your righteousness is an everlasting righteousness.  Your law is truth.
119:143 Trouble and anguish have taken hold of me.  Your commandments  are my delight.
119:144 Your testimonies are righteous forever.  Give me understanding,  that I may live.
119:145 I have called with my whole heart.  Answer me, Yahweh!  I will  keep your statutes.
119:146 I have called to you.  Save me!  I will obey your statutes.
119:147 I rise before dawn and cry for help.  I put my hope in your words.
119:148 My eyes stay open through the night watches, that I might  meditate on your word.
119:149 Hear my voice according to your loving kindness.  Revive me, Yahweh, according to your ordinances.
119:150 They draw near who follow after wickedness.  They are far  from your law.
119:151 You are near, Yahweh.  All your commandments are truth.
119:152 Of old I have known from your testimonies, that you have  founded them forever.
119:153 Consider my affliction, and deliver me, for I don't forget your law.
119:154 Plead my cause, and redeem me!  Revive me according to your promise.
119:155 Salvation is far from the wicked, for they don't seek your statutes.
119:156 Great are your tender mercies, Yahweh.  Revive me according  to your ordinances.
119:157 Many are my persecutors and my adversaries.  I haven't swerved  from your testimonies.
119:158 I look at the faithless with loathing, because they don't  observe your word.
119:159 Consider how I love your precepts.  Revive me, Yahweh, according to  your loving kindness.
119:160 All of your words are truth.  Every one of your righteous  ordinances endures forever.
119:161 Princes have persecuted me without a cause, but my heart stands  in awe of your words.
119:162 I rejoice at your word, as one who finds great spoil.
119:163 I hate and abhor falsehood.  I love your law.
119:164 Seven times a day, I praise you, because of your  righteous ordinances.
119:165 Those who love your law have great peace.  Nothing causes  them to stumble.
119:166 I have hoped for your salvation, Yahweh.  I have  done your commandments.
119:167 My soul has observed your testimonies.  I love them exceedingly.
119:168 I have obeyed your precepts and your testimonies, for all my  ways are before you.
119:169 Let my cry come before you, Yahweh.  Give me understanding  according to your word.
119:170 Let my supplication come before you.  Deliver me according  to your word.
119:171 Let my lips utter praise, for you teach me your statutes.
119:172 Let my tongue sing of your word, for all your commandments  are righteousness.
119:173 Let your hand be ready to help me, for I have chosen your precepts.
119:174 I have longed for your salvation, Yahweh.  Your law is my delight.
119:175 Let my soul live, that I may praise you.  Let your  ordinances help me.
119:176 I have gone astray like a lost sheep.  Seek your servant,  for I don't forget your commandments.
120:001 <<A Song of Ascents.>> In my distress, I cried to Yahweh.  He answered me.
120:002 Deliver my soul, Yahweh, from lying lips, from a deceitful tongue.
120:003 What will be given to you, and what will be done more to you,  you deceitful tongue?
120:004 Sharp arrows of the mighty, with coals of juniper.
120:005 Woe is me, that I live in Meshech, that I dwell among  the tents of Kedar!
120:006 My soul has had her dwelling too long with him who hates peace.
120:007 I am for peace, but when I speak, they are for war.
121:001 <<A Song of Ascents.>> I will lift up my eyes to the hills.  Where does my help come from?
121:002 My help comes from Yahweh, who made heaven and earth.
121:003 He will not allow your foot to be moved.  He who keeps you  will not slumber.
121:004 Behold, he who keeps Israel will neither slumber nor sleep.
121:005 Yahweh is your keeper.  Yahweh is your shade on your right hand.
121:006 The sun will not harm you by day, nor the moon by night.
121:007 Yahweh will keep you from all evil.  He will keep your soul.
121:008 Yahweh will keep your going out and your coming in, from this  time forth, and forevermore.
122:001 <<A Song of Ascents.  By David.>> I was glad when they said to me,  "Let's go to Yahweh's house!"
122:002 Our feet are standing within your gates, Jerusalem;
122:003 Jerusalem, that is built as a city that is compact together;
122:004 where the tribes go up, even Yah's tribes, according to an  ordinance for Israel, to give thanks to the name of Yahweh.
122:005 For there are set thrones for judgment, the thrones  of David's house.
122:006 Pray for the peace of Jerusalem.  Those who love you will prosper.
122:007 Peace be within your walls, and prosperity within your palaces.
122:008 For my brothers' and companions' sakes, I will now say,  "Peace be within you."
122:009 For the sake of the house of Yahweh our God, I will seek your good.
123:001 <<A Song of Ascents.>> To you I do lift up my eyes, you who sit  in the heavens.
123:002 Behold, as the eyes of servants look to the hand of their master,  as the eyes of a maid to the hand of her mistress; so our eyes  look to Yahweh, our God, until he has mercy on us.
123:003 Have mercy on us, Yahweh, have mercy on us, for we have  endured much contempt.
123:004 Our soul is exceedingly filled with the scoffing of those who  are at ease, with the contempt of the proud.
124:001 <<A Song of Ascents.  By David.>> If it had not been Yahweh  who was on our side, let Israel now say,
124:002 if it had not been Yahweh who was on our side, when men rose  up against us;
124:003 then they would have swallowed us up alive, when their wrath  was kindled against us;
124:004 then the waters would have overwhelmed us, the stream would  have gone over our soul;
124:005 then the proud waters would have gone over our soul.
124:006 Blessed be Yahweh, who has not given us as a prey to their teeth.
124:007 Our soul has escaped like a bird out of the fowler's snare.  The snare is broken, and we have escaped.
124:008 Our help is in the name of Yahweh, who made heaven and earth.
125:001 <<A Song of Ascents.>> Those who trust in Yahweh are as Mount Zion,  which can't be moved, but remains forever.
125:002 As the mountains surround Jerusalem, so Yahweh surrounds his  people from this time forth and forevermore.
125:003 For the scepter of wickedness won't remain over the allotment  of the righteous; so that the righteous won't use their hands  to do evil.
125:004 Do good, Yahweh, to those who are good, to those who are upright  in their hearts.
125:005 But as for those who turn aside to their crooked ways,  Yahweh will lead them away with the workers of iniquity.  Peace be on Israel.
126:001 <<A Song of Ascents.>> When Yahweh brought back those who returned  to Zion, we were like those who dream.
126:002 Then our mouth was filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing.  Then they said among the nations, "Yahweh has done great  things for them."
126:003 Yahweh has done great things for us, and we are glad.
126:004 Restore our fortunes again, Yahweh, like the streams in the Negev.
126:005 Those who sow in tears will reap in joy.
126:006 He who goes out weeping, carrying seed for sowing, will certainly  come again with joy, carrying his sheaves.
127:001 <<A Song of Ascents.  By Solomon.>> Unless Yahweh builds  the house, they labor in vain who build it.  Unless Yahweh  watches over the city, the watchman guards it in vain.
127:002 It is vain for you to rise up early, to stay up late,  eating the bread of toil; for he gives sleep to his loved ones.
127:003 Behold, children are a heritage of Yahweh.  The fruit of the womb  is his reward.
127:004 As arrows in the hand of a mighty man, so are the children of youth.
127:005 Happy is the man who has his quiver full of them.  They won't be disappointed when they speak with their enemies  in the gate.
128:001 <<A Song of Ascents.>> Blessed is everyone who fears Yahweh,  who walks in his ways.
128:002 For you will eat the labor of your hands.  You will be happy,  and it will be well with you.
128:003 Your wife will be as a fruitful vine, in the innermost  parts of your house; your children like olive plants,  around your table.
128:004 Behold, thus is the man blessed who fears Yahweh.
128:005 May Yahweh bless you out of Zion, and may you see the good  of Jerusalem all the days of your life.
128:006 Yes, may you see your children's children.  Peace be upon Israel.
129:001 <<A Song of Ascents.>> Many times they have afflicted me  from my youth up.  Let Israel now say,
129:002 many times they have afflicted me from my youth up, yet they  have not prevailed against me.
129:003 The plowers plowed on my back.  They made their furrows long.
129:004 Yahweh is righteous.  He has cut apart the cords of the wicked.
129:005 Let them be disappointed and turned backward, all those  who hate Zion.
129:006 Let them be as the grass on the housetops, which withers  before it grows up;
129:007 with which the reaper doesn't fill his hand, nor he who  binds sheaves, his bosom.
129:008 Neither do those who go by say, "The blessing of Yahweh be on you.  We bless you in the name of Yahweh."
130:001 <<A Song of Ascents.>> Out of the depths I have cried  to you, Yahweh.
130:002 Lord, hear my voice.  Let your ears be attentive to the voice  of my petitions.
130:003 If you, Yah, kept a record of sins, Lord, who could stand?
130:004 But there is forgiveness with you, therefore you are feared.
130:005 I wait for Yahweh.  My soul waits.  I hope in his word.
130:006 My soul longs for the Lord more than watchmen long for the morning;  more than watchmen for the morning.
130:007 Israel, hope in Yahweh, for with Yahweh there is loving kindness.  With him is abundant redemption.
130:008 He will redeem Israel from all their sins.
131:001 <<A Song of Ascents.  By David.>> Yahweh, my heart isn't haughty,  nor my eyes lofty; nor do I concern myself with great matters,  or things too wonderful for me.
131:002 Surely I have stilled and quieted my soul, like a weaned child  with his mother, like a weaned child is my soul within me.
131:003 Israel, hope in Yahweh, from this time forth and forevermore.
132:001 <<A Song of Ascents.>> Yahweh, remember David and all his affliction,
132:002 how he swore to Yahweh, and vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob:
132:003 "Surely I will not come into the structure of my house,  nor go up into my bed;
132:004 I will not give sleep to my eyes, or slumber to my eyelids;
132:005 until I find out a place for Yahweh, a dwelling for the  Mighty One of Jacob."
132:006 Behold, we heard of it in Ephrathah.  We found it in the  field of Jaar:
132:007 "We will go into his dwelling place.  We will worship  at his footstool.
132:008 Arise, Yahweh, into your resting place; you, and the ark  of your strength.
132:009 Let your priest be clothed with righteousness.  Let your saints  shout for joy!"
132:010 For your servant David's sake, don't turn away the face  of your anointed one.
132:011 Yahweh has sworn to David in truth.  He will not turn from it:  "I will set the fruit of your body on your throne.
132:012 If your children will keep my covenant, my testimony  that I will teach them, their children also will sit on  your throne forevermore."
132:013 For Yahweh has chosen Zion.  He has desired it for his habitation.
132:014 "This is my resting place forever.  Here I will live, for I  have desired it.
132:015 I will abundantly bless her provision.  I will satisfy her  poor with bread.
132:016 Her priests I will also clothe with salvation.  Her saints  will shout aloud for joy.
132:017 There I will make the horn of David to bud.  I have ordained  a lamp for my anointed.
132:018 I will clothe his enemies with shame, but on himself,  his crown will be resplendent."
133:001 <<A Song of Ascents.  By David.>> See how good and how pleasant  it is for brothers to live together in unity!
133:002 It is like the precious oil on the head, that ran down on the beard,  even Aaron's beard; that came down on the edge of his robes;
133:003 like the dew of Hermon, that comes down on the hills of Zion:  for there Yahweh gives the blessing, even life forevermore.
134:001 <<A Song of Ascents.>> Look!  Praise Yahweh, all you servants  of Yahweh, who stand by night in Yahweh's house!
134:002 Lift up your hands in the sanctuary.  Praise Yahweh!
134:003 May Yahweh bless you from Zion; even he who made heaven and earth.
135:001 Praise Yah!  Praise the name of Yahweh!  Praise him,  you servants of Yahweh,
135:002 you who stand in the house of Yahweh, in the courts of  our God's house.
135:003 Praise Yah, for Yahweh is good.  Sing praises to his name,  for that is pleasant.
135:004 For Yah has chosen Jacob for himself; Israel for his own possession.
135:005 For I know that Yahweh is great, that our Lord is above all gods.
135:006 Whatever Yahweh pleased, that he has done, in heaven and in earth,  in the seas and in all deeps;
135:007 who causes the clouds to rise from the ends of the earth;  who makes lightnings with the rain; who brings forth the wind  out of his treasuries;
135:008 Who struck the firstborn of Egypt, both of man and animal;
135:009 Who sent signs and wonders into the midst of you, Egypt, on Pharaoh,  and on all his servants;
135:010 who struck many nations, and killed mighty kings,
135:011 Sihon king of the Amorites, Og king of Bashan, and all  the kingdoms of Canaan,
135:012 and gave their land for a heritage, a heritage to Israel, his people.
135:013 Your name, Yahweh, endures forever; your renown, Yahweh,  throughout all generations.
135:014 For Yahweh will judge his people, and have compassion  on his servants.
135:015 The idols of the nations are silver and gold, the work  of men's hands.
135:016 They have mouths, but they can't speak.  They have eyes,  but they can't see.
135:017 They have ears, but they can't hear; neither is there any breath  in their mouths.
135:018 Those who make them will be like them; yes, everyone who  trusts in them.
135:019 House of Israel, praise Yahweh!  House of Aaron, praise Yahweh!
135:020 House of Levi, praise Yahweh!  You who fear Yahweh, praise Yahweh!
135:021 Blessed be Yahweh from Zion, Who dwells at Jerusalem.  Praise Yah!
136:001 Give thanks to Yahweh, for he is good; for his loving  kindness endures forever.
136:002 Give thanks to the God of gods; for his loving kindness  endures forever.
136:003 Give thanks to the Lord of lords; for his loving  kindness endures forever:
136:004 To him who alone does great wonders; for his loving  kindness endures forever:
136:005 To him who by understanding made the heavens; for his loving  kindness endures forever:
136:006 To him who spread out the earth above the waters; for his loving  kindness endures forever:
136:007 To him who made the great lights; for his loving  kindness endures forever:
136:008 The sun to rule by day; for his loving kindness endures forever;
136:009 The moon and stars to rule by night; for his loving  kindness endures forever:
136:010 To him who struck down the Egyptian firstborn; for his loving  kindness endures forever;
136:011 And brought out Israel from among them; for his loving  kindness endures forever;
136:012 With a strong hand, and with an outstretched arm; for his loving  kindness endures forever:
136:013 To him who divided the Red Sea{or, Sea of Reeds} apart;  for his loving kindness endures forever;
136:014 And made Israel to pass through the midst of it; for his loving  kindness endures forever;
136:015 But overthrew Pharaoh and his army in the Red Sea{or, Sea of Reeds};  for his loving kindness endures forever:
136:016 To him who led his people through the wilderness; for his loving  kindness endures forever:
136:017 To him who struck great kings; for his loving kindness  endures forever;
136:018 And killed mighty kings; for his loving kindness endures forever:
136:019 Sihon king of the Amorites; for his loving kindness endures forever;
136:020 Og king of Bashan; for his loving kindness endures forever;
136:021 And gave their land as an inheritance; for his loving  kindness endures forever;
136:022 Even a heritage to Israel his servant; for his loving  kindness endures forever:
136:023 Who remembered us in our low estate; for his loving  kindness endures forever;
136:024 And has delivered us from our adversaries; for his loving  kindness endures forever:
136:025 Who gives food to every creature; for his loving  kindness endures forever.
136:026 Oh give thanks to the God of heaven; for his loving  kindness endures forever.
137:001 By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down.  Yes, we wept,  when we remembered Zion.
137:002 On the willows in the midst of it, we hung up our harps.
137:003 For there, those who led us captive asked us for songs.  Those who tormented us demanded songs of joy:  "Sing us one  of the songs of Zion!"
137:004 How can we sing Yahweh's song in a foreign land?
137:005 If I forget you, Jerusalem, let my right hand forget its skill.
137:006 Let my tongue stick to the roof of my mouth if I don't remember you;  if I don't prefer Jerusalem above my chief joy.
137:007 Remember, Yahweh, against the children of Edom, the day of Jerusalem;  who said, "Raze it!  Raze it even to its foundation!"
137:008 Daughter of Babylon, doomed to destruction, he will be happy  who rewards you, as you have served us.
137:009 Happy shall he be, who takes and dashes your little ones  against the rock.
138:001 <<By David.>> I will give you thanks with my whole heart.  Before the gods, I will sing praises to you.
138:002 I will bow down toward your holy temple, and give thanks  to your Name for your loving kindness and for your truth;  for you have exalted your Name and your Word above all.
138:003 In the day that I called, you answered me.  You encouraged me  with strength in my soul.
138:004 All the kings of the earth will give you thanks, Yahweh, for they  have heard the words of your mouth.
138:005 Yes, they will sing of the ways of Yahweh; for great  is Yahweh's glory.
138:006 For though Yahweh is high, yet he looks after the lowly;  but the proud, he knows from afar.
138:007 Though I walk in the midst of trouble, you will revive me.  You will stretch forth your hand against the wrath of my enemies.  Your right hand will save me.
138:008 Yahweh will fulfill that which concerns me; your loving  kindness, Yahweh, endures forever.  Don't forsake the works  of your own hands.
139:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  A Psalm by David.>> Yahweh,  you have searched me, and you know me.
139:002 You know my sitting down and my rising up.  You perceive  my thoughts from afar.
139:003 You search out my path and my lying down, and are acquainted  with all my ways.
139:004 For there is not a word on my tongue, but, behold, Yahweh,  you know it altogether.
139:005 You hem me in behind and before.  You laid your hand on me.
139:006 This knowledge is beyond me.  It's lofty.  I can't attain it.
139:007 Where could I go from your Spirit?  Or where could I flee  from your presence?
139:008 If I ascend up into heaven, you are there.  If I make my bed  in Sheol, behold, you are there!
139:009 If I take the wings of the dawn, and settle in the uttermost  parts of the sea;
139:010 Even there your hand will lead me, and your right hand  will hold me.
139:011 If I say, "Surely the darkness will overwhelm me; the light  around me will be night;"
139:012 even the darkness doesn't hide from you, but the night shines  as the day.  The darkness is like light to you.
139:013 For you formed my inmost being.  You knit me together in  my mother's womb.
139:014 I will give thanks to you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.  Your works are wonderful.  My soul knows that very well.
139:015 My frame wasn't hidden from you, when I was made in secret,  woven together in the depths of the earth.
139:016 Your eyes saw my body.  In your book they were all written,  the days that were ordained for me, when as yet there were  none of them.
139:017 How precious to me are your thoughts, God!  How vast is  the sum of them!
139:018 If I would count them, they are more in number than the sand.  When I wake up, I am still with you.
139:019 If only you, God, would kill the wicked.  Get away from me,  you bloodthirsty men!
139:020 For they speak against you wickedly.  Your enemies take your  name in vain.
139:021 Yahweh, don't I hate those who hate you?  Am I not grieved  with those who rise up against you?
139:022 I hate them with perfect hatred.  They have become my enemies.
139:023 Search me, God, and know my heart.  Try me, and know my thoughts.
139:024 See if there is any wicked way in me, and lead me in  the everlasting way.
140:001 <<For the Chief Musician.  A Psalm by David.>> Deliver me,  Yahweh, from the evil man.  Preserve me from the violent man;
140:002 those who devise mischief in their hearts.  They continually  gather themselves together for war.
140:003 They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent.  Viper's poison is under their lips.  Selah.
140:004 Yahweh, keep me from the hands of the wicked.  Preserve me  from the violent men who have determined to trip my feet.
140:005 The proud have hidden a snare for me, they have spread the cords  of a net by the path.  They have set traps for me.  Selah.
140:006 I said to Yahweh, "You are my God."  Listen to the cry  of my petitions, Yahweh.
140:007 Yahweh, the Lord, the strength of my salvation, you have covered  my head in the day of battle.
140:008 Yahweh, don't grant the desires of the wicked.  Don't let  their evil plans succeed, or they will become proud.  Selah.
140:009 As for the head of those who surround me, let the mischief  of their own lips cover them.
140:010 Let burning coals fall on them.  Let them be thrown into the fire,  into miry pits, from where they never rise.
140:011 An evil speaker won't be established in the earth.  Evil will hunt the violent man to overthrow him.
140:012 I know that Yahweh will maintain the cause of the afflicted,  and justice for the needy.
140:013 Surely the righteous will give thanks to your name.  The upright will dwell in your presence.
141:001 <<A Psalm by David.>> Yahweh, I have called on you.  Come to me quickly!  Listen to my voice when I call to you.
141:002 Let my prayer be set before you like incense; the lifting up  of my hands like the evening sacrifice.
141:003 Set a watch, Yahweh, before my mouth.  Keep the door of my lips.
141:004 Don't incline my heart to any evil thing, to practice deeds  of wickedness with men who work iniquity.  Don't let me eat  of their delicacies.
141:005 Let the righteous strike me, it is kindness; let him reprove me,  it is like oil on the head; don't let my head refuse it;  Yet my prayer is always against evil deeds.
141:006 Their judges are thrown down by the sides of the rock.  They will hear my words, for they are well spoken.
141:007 "As when one plows and breaks up the earth, our bones are  scattered at the mouth of Sheol."
141:008 For my eyes are on you, Yahweh, the Lord.  In you, I take refuge.  Don't leave my soul destitute.
141:009 Keep me from the snare which they have laid for me,  from the traps of the workers of iniquity.
141:010 Let the wicked fall together into their own nets, while I pass by.
142:001 <<A contemplation by David, when he was in the cave.  A Prayer.>> I cry with my voice to Yahweh.  With my voice,  I ask Yahweh for mercy.
142:002 I pour out my complaint before him.  I tell him my troubles.
142:003 When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, you knew my path.  In the way in which I walk, they have hidden a snare for me.
142:004 Look on my right, and see; for there is no one who is concerned  for me.  Refuge has fled from me.  No one cares for my soul.
142:005 I cried to you, Yahweh.  I said, "You are my refuge, my portion  in the land of the living."
142:006 Listen to my cry, for I am in desperate need.  deliver me  from my persecutors, For they are stronger than me.
142:007 Bring my soul out of prison, that I may give thanks to your name.  The righteous will surround me, for you will be good to me.
143:001 <<A Psalm by David.>> Hear my prayer, Yahweh.  Listen to  my petitions.  In your faithfulness and righteousness, relieve me.
143:002 Don't enter into judgment with your servant, for in your sight  no man living is righteous.
143:003 For the enemy pursues my soul.  He has struck my life  down to the ground.  He has made me live in dark places,  as those who have been long dead.
143:004 Therefore my spirit is overwhelmed within me.  My heart within  me is desolate.
143:005 I remember the days of old.  I meditate on all your doings.  I contemplate the work of your hands.
143:006 I spread forth my hands to you.  My soul thirsts for you,  like a parched land.  Selah.
143:007 Hurry to answer me, Yahweh.  My spirit fails.  Don't hide  your face from me, so that I don't become like those who go  down into the pit.
143:008 Cause me to hear your loving kindness in the morning, for I  trust in you.  Cause me to know the way in which I should walk,  for I lift up my soul to you.
143:009 Deliver me, Yahweh, from my enemies.  I flee to you to hide me.
143:010 Teach me to do your will, for you are my God.  Your Spirit is good.  Lead me in the land of uprightness.
143:011 Revive me, Yahweh, for your name's sake.  In your righteousness,  bring my soul out of trouble.
143:012 In your loving kindness, cut off my enemies, and destroy all  those who afflict my soul, For I am your servant.
144:001 <<By David.>> Blessed be Yahweh, my rock, who teaches my hands  to war, and my fingers to battle:
144:002 my loving kindness, my fortress, my high tower, my deliverer,  my shield, and he in whom I take refuge; who subdues my  people under me.
144:003 Yahweh, what is man, that you care for him?  Or the son of man,  that you think of him?
144:004 Man is like a breath.  His days are like a shadow that passes away.
144:005 Part your heavens, Yahweh, and come down.  Touch the mountains,  and they will smoke.
144:006 Throw out lightning, and scatter them.  Send out your arrows,  and rout them.
144:007 Stretch out your hand from above, rescue me, and deliver me  out of great waters, out of the hands of foreigners;
144:008 whose mouths speak deceit, Whose right hand is a right  hand of falsehood.
144:009 I will sing a new song to you, God.  On a ten-stringed lyre,  I will sing praises to you.
144:010 You are he who gives salvation to kings, who rescues David,  his servant, from the deadly sword.
144:011 Rescue me, and deliver me out of the hands of foreigners,  whose mouths speak deceit, whose right hand is a right  hand of falsehood.
144:012 Then our sons will be like well-nurtured plants, our daughters  like pillars carved to adorn a palace.
144:013 Our barns are full, filled with all kinds of provision.  Our sheep bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our fields.
144:014 Our oxen will pull heavy loads.  There is no breaking in,  and no going away, and no outcry in our streets.
144:015 Happy are the people who are in such a situation.  Happy are the people whose God is Yahweh.  {}
145:001 <<A praise psalm by David.This is an acrostic psalm,  with every verse (including the second half of verse 13)  starting with a consecutive letter of the Hebrew alphabet.>>  I will exalt you, my God, the King.  I will praise your name  forever and ever.
145:002 Every day I will praise you.  I will extol your name  forever and ever.
145:003 Great is Yahweh, and greatly to be praised!  His greatness is unsearchable.
145:004 One generation will commend your works to another, and will  declare your mighty acts.
145:005 Of the glorious majesty of your honor, of your wondrous works,  I will meditate.
145:006 Men will speak of the might of your awesome acts.  I will declare your greatness.
145:007 They will utter the memory of your great goodness, and will  sing of your righteousness.
145:008 Yahweh is gracious, merciful, slow to anger, and of  great loving kindness.
145:009 Yahweh is good to all.  His tender mercies are over all his works.
145:010 All your works will give thanks to you, Yahweh.  Your saints  will extol you.
145:011 They will speak of the glory of your kingdom, and talk  about your power;
145:012 to make known to the sons of men his mighty acts, the glory  of the majesty of his kingdom.
145:013 Your kingdom is an everlasting kingdom.  Your dominion endures  throughout all generations.  Yahweh is faithful in all his words,  and loving in all his deeds.{Some manuscripts omit these  last two lines.}
145:014 Yahweh upholds all who fall, and raises up all those who  are bowed down.
145:015 The eyes of all wait for you.  You give them their food  in due season.
145:016 You open your hand, and satisfy the desire of every living thing.
145:017 Yahweh is righteous in all his ways, and gracious in all his works.
145:018 Yahweh is near to all those who call on him, to all who call  on him in truth.
145:019 He will fulfill the desire of those who fear him.  He also will hear their cry, and will save them.
145:020 Yahweh preserves all those who love him, but all the wicked  he will destroy.
145:021 My mouth will speak the praise of Yahweh.  Let all flesh bless  his holy name forever and ever.
146:001 Praise Yah!  Praise Yahweh, my soul.
146:002 While I live, I will praise Yahweh.  I will sing praises  to my God as long as I exist.
146:003 Don't put your trust in princes, each a son of man in whom  there is no help.
146:004 His spirit departs, and he returns to the earth.  In that very day, his thoughts perish.
146:005 Happy is he who has the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope  is in Yahweh, his God:
146:006 who made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them;  who keeps truth forever;
146:007 who executes justice for the oppressed; who gives food to the hungry.  Yahweh frees the prisoners.
146:008 Yahweh opens the eyes of the blind.  Yahweh raises up those  who are bowed down.  Yahweh loves the righteous.
146:009 Yahweh preserves the foreigners.  He upholds the fatherless  and widow, but the way of the wicked he turns upside down.
146:010 Yahweh will reign forever; your God, O Zion, to all generations.  Praise Yah!
147:001 Praise Yah, for it is good to sing praises to our God;  for it is pleasant and fitting to praise him.
147:002 Yahweh builds up Jerusalem.  He gathers together the  outcasts of Israel.
147:003 He heals the broken in heart, and binds up their wounds.
147:004 He counts the number of the stars.  He calls them all  by their names.
147:005 Great is our Lord, and mighty in power.  His understanding  is infinite.
147:006 Yahweh upholds the humble.  He brings the wicked down  to the ground.
147:007 Sing to Yahweh with thanksgiving.  Sing praises on the harp  to our God,
147:008 who covers the sky with clouds, who prepares rain for the earth,  who makes grass grow on the mountains.
147:009 He provides food for the livestock, and for the young ravens  when they call.
147:010 He doesn't delight in the strength of the horse.  He takes no pleasure in the legs of a man.
147:011 Yahweh takes pleasure in those who fear him, in those who hope  in his loving kindness.
147:012 Praise Yahweh, Jerusalem!  Praise your God, Zion!
147:013 For he has strengthened the bars of your gates.  He has blessed your children within you.
147:014 He makes peace in your borders.  He fills you with the finest  of the wheat.
147:015 He sends out his commandment to the earth.  His word  runs very swiftly.
147:016 He gives snow like wool, and scatters frost like ashes.
147:017 He hurls down his hail like pebbles.  Who can stand before his cold?
147:018 He sends out his word, and melts them.  He causes his wind  to blow, and the waters flow.
147:019 He shows his word to Jacob; his statutes and his ordinances  to Israel.
147:020 He has not done this for just any nation.  They don't know  his ordinances.  Praise Yah!
148:001 Praise Yah!  Praise Yahweh from the heavens!  Praise him  in the heights!
148:002 Praise him, all his angels!  Praise him, all his army!
148:003 Praise him, sun and moon!  Praise him, all you shining stars!
148:004 Praise him, you heavens of heavens, You waters that are  above the heavens.
148:005 Let them praise the name of Yahweh, For he commanded,  and they were created.
148:006 He has also established them forever and ever.  He has made  a decree which will not pass away.
148:007 Praise Yahweh from the earth, you great sea creatures,  and all depths!
148:008 Lightning and hail, snow and clouds; stormy wind,  fulfilling his word;
148:009 mountains and all hills; fruit trees and all cedars;
148:010 wild animals and all livestock; small creatures and flying birds;
148:011 kings of the earth and all peoples; princes and all judges  of the earth;
148:012 both young men and maidens; old men and children:
148:013 let them praise the name of Yahweh, for his name alone is exalted.  His glory is above the earth and the heavens.
148:014 He has lifted up the horn of his people, the praise of all  his saints; even of the children of Israel, a people near  to him.  Praise Yah!
149:001 Praise Yahweh!  Sing to Yahweh a new song, his praise in  the assembly of the saints.
149:002 Let Israel rejoice in him who made them.  Let the children  of Zion be joyful in their King.
149:003 Let them praise his name in the dance!  Let them sing praises  to him with tambourine and harp!
149:004 For Yahweh takes pleasure in his people.  He crowns  the humble with salvation.
149:005 Let the saints rejoice in honor.  Let them sing for joy  on their beds.
149:006 May the high praises of God be in their mouths, and a two-edged  sword in their hand;
149:007 To execute vengeance on the nations, and punishments on the peoples;
149:008 To bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with  fetters of iron;
149:009 to execute on them the written judgment.  All his saints  have this honor.  Praise Yah!
150:001 Praise Yah!  Praise God in his sanctuary!  Praise him in his  heavens for his acts of power!
150:002 Praise him for his mighty acts!  Praise him according to  his excellent greatness!
150:003 Praise him with the sounding of the trumpet!  Praise him  with harp and lyre!
150:004 Praise him with tambourine and dancing!  Praise him with stringed  instruments and flute!
150:005 Praise him with loud cymbals!  Praise him with resounding cymbals!
150:006 Let everything that has breath praise Yah!  Praise Yah!Book 20 Proverbs
051:020 You are my battle axe and weapons of war:  and with you will I  break in pieces the nations; and with you will I destroy kingdoms;
051:021 and with you will I break in pieces the horse and his rider;
051:022 and with you will I break in pieces the chariot and him who  rides therein; and with you will I break in pieces man and woman;  and with you will I break in pieces the old man and the youth;  and with you will I break in pieces the young man and the virgin;
051:023 and with you will I break in pieces the shepherd and his flock;  and with you will I break in pieces the farmer and his  yoke [of oxen]; and with you will I break in pieces  governors and deputies.
052:010 The king of Babylon killed the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes:  he killed also all the princes of Judah in Riblah.
052:011 He put out the eyes of Zedekiah; and the king of Babylon  bound him in fetters, and carried him to Babylon, and put  him in prison until the day of his death.
052:012 Now in the fifth month, in the tenth day of the month,  which was the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar,  king of Babylon, came Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard,  who stood before the king of Babylon, into Jerusalem:
052:013 and he burned the house of Yahweh, and the king's house;  and all the houses of Jerusalem, even every great house,  burned he with fire.
052:014 All the army of the Chaldeans, who were with the captain of  the guard, broke down all the walls of Jerusalem round about.
052:015 Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive  of the poorest of the people, and the residue of the people  who were left in the city, and those who fell away, who fell  to the king of Babylon, and the residue of the multitude.
053:007 He was oppressed, yet when he was afflicted he didn't open his mouth.  As a lamb that is led to the slaughter, and as a sheep that  before its shearers is mute, so he didn't open his mouth.
053:008 He was taken away by oppression and judgment; and as for  his generation, who considered that he was cut off out  of the land of the living and stricken for the disobedience  of my people?
053:009 They made his grave with the wicked, and with a rich man  in his death; although he had done no violence, neither was  any deceit in his mouth.
053:010 Yet it pleased Yahweh to bruise him.  He has caused him to suffer.  When you make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see his seed.  He shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of Yahweh shall  prosper in his hand.
053:011 After the suffering of his soul, he will see the  light{So read the Dead Sea Scrolls and Septuagint.  Masoretic Text omits "the light".} and be satisfied.  My righteous servant will justify many by the knowledge of himself;  and he will bear their iniquities.
053:012 Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great,  and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he poured  out his soul to death, and was numbered with the transgressors;  yet he bore the sin of many, and made intercession  for the transgressors.
054:008 In overflowing wrath I hid my face from you for a moment;  but with everlasting loving kindness will I have mercy on you,  says Yahweh your Redeemer.
054:009 For this is [as] the waters of Noah to me; for as I have sworn  that the waters of Noah shall no more go over the earth,  so have I sworn that I will not be angry with you,  nor rebuke you.
054:010 For the mountains may depart, and the hills be removed;  but my loving kindness shall not depart from you,  neither shall my covenant of peace be removed, says Yahweh  who has mercy on you.
054:011 You afflicted, tossed with storms, and not comforted, behold,  I will set your stones in beautiful colors, and lay your  foundations with sapphires.
054:012 I will make your pinnacles of rubies, and your gates of  sparkling jewels, and all your walls of precious stones.
054:013 All your children shall be taught of Yahweh; and great shall  be the peace of your children.
054:014 In righteousness shall you be established:  you shall be far  from oppression, for you shall not be afraid; and from terror,  for it shall not come near you.
054:015 Behold, they may gather together, but not by me:  whoever shall  gather together against you shall fall because of you.
054:016 Behold, I have created the smith who blows the fire of coals,  and brings forth a weapon for his work; and I have created  the waster to destroy.
054:017 No weapon that is formed against you shall prosper; and every  tongue that shall rise against you in judgment you shall condemn.  This is the heritage of the servants of Yahweh, and their  righteousness which is of me, says Yahweh.
057:012 I will declare your righteousness; and as for your works,  they shall not profit you.
057:013 When you cry, let those who you have gathered deliver you;  but the wind shall take them, a breath shall carry them all away:  but he who takes refuge in me shall possess the land,  and shall inherit my holy mountain.
057:014 He will say, Cast up, cast up, prepare the way, take up  the stumbling-block out of the way of my people.
057:015 For thus says the high and lofty One who inhabits eternity,  whose name is Holy:  I dwell in the high and holy place,  with him also who is of a contrite and humble spirit,  to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart  of the contrite.
057:016 For I will not contend forever, neither will I be always angry;  for the spirit would faint before me, and the souls who  I have made.
057:017 For the iniquity of his covetousness was I angry, and struck him;  I hid [my face] and was angry; and he went on backsliding  in the way of his heart.
057:018 I have seen his ways, and will heal him:  I will lead him also,  and restore comforts to him and to his mourners.
057:019 I create the fruit of the lips:  Peace, peace, to him who is far  off and to him who is near, says Yahweh; and I will heal him.
057:020 But the wicked are like the troubled sea; for it can't rest,  and its waters cast up mire and dirt.
057:021 There is no peace, says my God, to the wicked.
058:012 Those who shall be of you shall build the old waste places;  you shall raise up the foundations of many generations;  and you shall be called The repairer of the breach,  The restorer of paths to dwell in.
058:013 If you turn away your foot from the Sabbath, from doing your  pleasure on my holy day; and call the Sabbath a delight,  [and] the holy of Yahweh honorable; and shall honor it,  not doing your own ways, nor finding your own pleasure,  nor speaking [your own] words:
058:014 then shall you delight yourself in Yahweh; and I will  make you to ride on the high places of the earth;  and I will feed you with the heritage of Jacob your father:  for the mouth of Yahweh has spoken it.
059:018 According to their deeds, accordingly he will repay,  wrath to his adversaries, recompense to his enemies;  to the islands he will repay recompense.
059:019 So shall they fear the name of Yahweh from the west,  and his glory from the rising of the sun; for he will come  as a rushing stream, which the breath of Yahweh drives.
059:020 A Redeemer will come to Zion, and to those who turn from  disobedience in Jacob, says Yahweh.
059:021 As for me, this is my covenant with them, says Yahweh:  my Spirit who is on you, and my words which I have put in your mouth,  shall not depart out of your mouth, nor out of the mouth  of your seed, nor out of the mouth of your seed's seed,  says Yahweh, from henceforth and forever.
060:013 The glory of Lebanon shall come to you, the fir tree, the pine,  and the box tree together, to beautify the place of my sanctuary;  and I will make the place of my feet glorious.
060:014 The sons of those who afflicted you shall come bending to you;  and all those who despised you shall bow themselves down at  the soles of your feet; and they shall call you The city  of Yahweh, The Zion of the Holy One of Israel.
060:015 Whereas you have been forsaken and hated, so that no man  passed through you, I will make you an eternal excellency,  a joy of many generations.
060:016 You shall also suck the milk of the nations, and shall suck the breast  of kings; and you shall know that I, Yahweh, am your Savior,  and your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.
060:017 For brass I will bring gold, and for iron I will bring silver,  and for wood brass, and for stones iron.  I will also make  your officers peace, and righteousness your ruler.
060:018 Violence shall no more be heard in your land, desolation nor  destruction within your borders; but you shall call your  walls Salvation, and your gates Praise.
060:019 The sun shall be no more your light by day; neither for brightness  shall the moon give light to you:  but Yahweh will be to you  an everlasting light, and your God your glory.
060:020 Your sun shall no more go down, neither shall your moon  withdraw itself; for Yahweh will be your everlasting light,  and the days of your mourning shall be ended.
060:021 Your people also shall be all righteous; they shall inherit  the land forever, the branch of my planting, the work of my hands,  that I may be glorified.
060:022 The little one shall become a thousand, and the small one  a strong nation; I, Yahweh, will hasten it in its time.
061:009 Their seed shall be known among the nations, and their offspring  among the peoples; all who see them shall acknowledge them,  that they are the seed which Yahweh has blessed.
061:010 I will greatly rejoice in Yahweh, my soul shall be joyful in my God;  for he has clothed me with the garments of salvation, he has  covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a bridegroom  decks himself with a garland, and as a bride adorns herself  with her jewels.
061:011 For as the earth brings forth its bud, and as the garden  causes the things that are sown in it to spring forth;  so the Lord Yahweh will cause righteousness and praise  to spring forth before all the nations.
063:012 who caused his glorious arm to go at the right hand of Moses?  who divided the waters before them, to make himself  an everlasting name?
063:013 who led them through the depths, as a horse in the wilderness,  so that they didn't stumble?
063:014 As the livestock that go down into the valley, the Spirit  of Yahweh caused them to rest; so did you lead your people,  to make yourself a glorious name.
063:015 Look down from heaven, and see from the habitation of your  holiness and of your glory:  where are your zeal and your  mighty acts? the yearning of your heart and your compassion  is restrained toward me.
063:016 For you are our Father, though Abraham doesn't know us,  and Israel does not acknowledge us:  you, Yahweh, are our Father;  our Redeemer from everlasting is your name.
063:017 O Yahweh, why do you make us to err from your ways,  and harden our heart from your fear?  Return for your servants'  sake, the tribes of your inheritance.
063:018 Your holy people possessed [it] but a little while:  our adversaries have trodden down your sanctuary.
063:019 We are become as they over whom you never bear rule,  as those who were not called by your name.
064:011 Our holy and our beautiful house, where our fathers praised you,  is burned with fire; and all our pleasant places are laid waste.
064:012 Will you refrain yourself for these things, Yahweh? will you  hold your peace, and afflict us very sore?
065:014 behold, my servants shall sing for joy of heart, but you shall  cry for sorrow of heart, and shall wail for vexation of spirit.
065:015 You shall leave your name for a curse to my chosen;  and the Lord Yahweh will kill you; and he will call his servants  by another name:
065:016 so that he who blesses himself in the earth shall bless himself  in the God of truth; and he who swears in the earth shall swear  by the God of truth; because the former troubles are forgotten,  and because they are hid from my eyes.
065:017 For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth; and the former  things shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.
065:018 But be you glad and rejoice forever in that which I create;  for, behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy.
065:019 I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in my people;  and there shall be heard in her no more the voice of weeping  and the voice of crying.
065:020 There shall be no more there an infant of days, nor an old  man who has not filled his days; for the child shall die  one hundred years old, and the sinner being one hundred years  old shall be accursed.
065:021 They shall build houses, and inhabit them; and they shall  plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them.
065:022 They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not plant,  and another eat:  for as the days of a tree shall be the days  of my people, and my chosen shall long enjoy the work  of their hands.
065:023 They shall not labor in vain, nor bring forth for calamity;  for they are the seed of the blessed of Yahweh, and their  offspring with them.
065:024 It shall happen that, before they call, I will answer;  and while they are yet speaking, I will hear.
065:025 The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall  eat straw like the ox; and dust shall be the serpent's food.  They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain,  says Yahweh.
066:021 Of them also will I take for priests [and] for Levites, says Yahweh.
066:022 For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make,  shall remain before me, says Yahweh, so shall your seed  and your name remain.
066:023 It shall happen, that from one new moon to another, and from  one Sabbath to another, shall all flesh come to worship  before me, says Yahweh.
066:024 They shall go forth, and look on the dead bodies of the men  who have transgressed against me:  for their worm shall not die,  neither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be  an abhorring to all flesh.Book 24 Jeremiah
048:023 As for the rest of the tribes:  from the east side to the  west side, Benjamin, one [portion].
048:024 By the border of Benjamin, from the east side to the west side,  Simeon, one [portion].
048:025 By the border of Simeon, from the east side to the west side,  Issachar, one [portion].
048:026 By the border of Issachar, from the east side to the west side,  Zebulun, one [portion].
048:027 By the border of Zebulun, from the east side to the west side,  Gad, one [portion].
048:028 By the border of Gad, at the south side southward, the border  shall be even from Tamar to the waters of Meribath Kadesh,  to the brook [of Egypt], to the great sea.
048:029 This is the land which you shall divide by lot to the tribes  of Israel for inheritance, and these are their several portions,  says the Lord Yahweh.
048:030 These are the exits of the city:  On the north side four  thousand and five hundred [reeds] by measure;
048:031 and the gates of the city shall be after the names of the tribes  of Israel, three gates northward:  the gate of Reuben, one;  the gate of Judah, one; the gate of Levi, one.
048:032 At the east side four thousand and five hundred [reeds],  and three gates:  even the gate of Joseph, one; the gate  of Benjamin, one; the gate of Dan, one.
048:033 At the south side four thousand and five hundred [reeds]  by measure, and three gates:  the gate of Simeon, one; the gate  of Issachar, one; the gate of Zebulun, one.
048:034 At the west side four thousand and five hundred [reeds],  with their three gates:  the gate of Gad, one; the gate  of Asher, one; the gate of Naphtali, one.
048:035 It shall be eighteen thousand [reeds] round about:  and the name of the city from that day shall be, Yahweh is there.Book 27 Daniel
048:036 Therefore my heart sounds for Moab like pipes, and my  heart sounds like pipes for the men of Kir Heres:  therefore the abundance that he has gotten is perished.
048:037 For every head is bald, and every beard clipped:  on all the hands are cuttings, and on the waist sackcloth.
048:038 On all the housetops of Moab and in the streets of it there is  lamentation every where; for I have broken Moab like a vessel  in which none delights, says Yahweh.
048:039 How is it broken down! [how] do they wail! how has Moab  turned the back with shame! so shall Moab become a derision  and a terror to all who are round about him.
048:040 For thus says Yahweh:  Behold, he shall fly as an eagle,  and shall spread out his wings against Moab.
048:041 Kerioth is taken, and the strongholds are seized, and the heart  of the mighty men of Moab at that day shall be as the heart  of a woman in her pangs.
048:042 Moab shall be destroyed from being a people, because he has  magnified himself against Yahweh.
048:043 Fear, and the pit, and the snare, are on you, inhabitant  of Moab, says Yahweh.
048:044 He who flees from the fear shall fall into the pit;  and he who gets up out of the pit shall be taken in the snare:  for I will bring on him, even on Moab, the year of  their visitation, says Yahweh.
048:045 Those who fled stand without strength under the shadow of Heshbon;  for a fire is gone forth out of Heshbon, and a flame from  the midst of Sihon, and has devoured the corner of Moab,  and the crown of the head of the tumultuous ones.
048:046 Woe to you, O Moab! the people of Chemosh is undone; for your sons  are taken away captive, and your daughters into captivity.
048:047 Yet will I bring back the captivity of Moab in the latter days,  says Yahweh.  Thus far is the judgment of Moab.
049:034 The word of Yahweh that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning Elam,  in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, saying,
049:035 Thus says Yahweh of Armies:  Behold, I will break the bow of Elam,  the chief of their might.
049:036 On Elam will I bring the four winds from the four quarters  of the sky, and will scatter them toward all those winds;  and there shall be no nation where the outcasts of Elam  shall not come.
049:037 I will cause Elam to be dismayed before their enemies,  and before those who seek their life; and I will bring evil  on them, even my fierce anger, says Yahweh; and I will send  the sword after them, until I have consumed them;
049:038 and I will set my throne in Elam, and will destroy from there  king and princes, says Yahweh.
049:039 But it shall happen in the latter days, that I will bring back  the captivity of Elam, says Yahweh.
050:027 Kill all her bulls; let them go down to the slaughter:  woe to them! for their day is come, the time of their visitation.
050:028 The voice of those who flee and escape out of the land  of Babylon, to declare in Zion the vengeance of Yahweh our God,  the vengeance of his temple.
050:029 Call together the archers against Babylon, all those who bend  the bow; encamp against her round about; let none of it escape:  recompense her according to her work; according to all that she  has done, do to her; for she has been proud against Yahweh,  against the Holy One of Israel.
050:030 Therefore shall her young men fall in her streets, and all her men  of war shall be brought to silence in that day, says Yahweh.
050:031 Behold, I am against you, you proud one, says the Lord, Yahweh  of Armies; for your day is come, the time that I will visit you.
050:032 The proud one shall stumble and fall, and none shall raise him up;  and I will kindle a fire in his cities, and it shall devour  all who are round about him.
050:033 Thus says Yahweh of Armies:  The children of Israel and the  children of Judah are oppressed together; and all who took  them captive hold them fast; they refuse to let them go.
050:034 Their Redeemer is strong; Yahweh of Armies is his name:  he will thoroughly plead their cause, that he may give rest  to the earth, and disquiet the inhabitants of Babylon.
050:035 A sword is on the Chaldeans, says Yahweh, and on the inhabitants  of Babylon, and on her princes, and on her wise men.
050:036 A sword is on the boasters, and they shall become fools;  a sword is on her mighty men, and they shall be dismayed.
050:037 A sword is on their horses, and on their chariots,  and on all the mixed people who are in the midst of her;  and they shall become as women:  a sword is on her treasures,  and they shall be robbed.
050:038 A drought is on her waters, and they shall be dried up;  for it is a land of engraved images, and they are mad over idols.
050:039 Therefore the wild animals of the desert with the wolves  shall dwell there, and the ostriches shall dwell therein:  and it shall be no more inhabited forever; neither shall it  be lived in from generation to generation.
050:040 As when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah and the neighbor  cities of it, says Yahweh, so shall no man dwell there,  neither shall any son of man sojourn therein.
050:041 Behold, a people comes from the north; and a great nation  and many kings shall be stirred up from the uttermost parts  of the earth.
050:042 They lay hold on bow and spear; they are cruel, and have no mercy;  their voice roars like the sea; and they ride on horses,  everyone set in array, as a man to the battle, against you,  daughter of Babylon.
050:043 The king of Babylon has heard the news of them, and his hands  wax feeble:  anguish has taken hold of him, [and] pangs  as of a woman in travail.
050:044 Behold, [the enemy] shall come up like a lion from  the pride of the Jordan against the strong habitation:  for I will suddenly make them run away from it;  and whoever is chosen, him will I appoint over it:  for who is like me? and who will appoint me a time? and who is  the shepherd who can stand before me?
050:045 Therefore hear the counsel of Yahweh, that he has taken  against Babylon; and his purposes, that he has purposed against  the land of the Chaldeans:  Surely they shall drag them away,  [even] the little ones of the flock; surely he shall make  their habitation desolate over them.
050:046 At the noise of the taking of Babylon the earth trembles,  and the cry is heard among the nations.
051:024 I will render to Babylon and to all the inhabitants of Chaldea  all their evil that they have done in Zion in your sight,  says Yahweh.
051:025 Behold, I am against you, destroying mountain, says Yahweh,  which destroys all the earth; and I will stretch out my hand  on you, and roll you down from the rocks, and will make you  a burnt mountain.
051:026 They shall not take of you a stone for a corner, nor a stone  for foundations; but you shall be desolate for ever, says Yahweh.
051:027 Set up a standard in the land, blow the trumpet among  the nations, prepare the nations against her, call together  against her the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and Ashkenaz:  appoint a marshal against her; cause the horses to come up  as the rough canker worm.
051:028 Prepare against her the nations, the kings of the Medes,  the governors of it, and all the deputies of it, and all  the land of their dominion.
051:029 The land trembles and is in pain; for the purposes of Yahweh  against Babylon do stand, to make the land of Babylon  a desolation, without inhabitant.
051:030 The mighty men of Babylon have forborne to fight,  they remain in their strongholds; their might has failed;  they are become as women:  her dwelling places are set on fire;  her bars are broken.
051:031 One runner will run to meet another, and one messenger  to meet another, to show the king of Babylon that his city  is taken on every quarter:
051:032 and the passages are seized, and the reeds they have burned  with fire, and the men of war are frightened.
051:033 For thus says Yahweh of Armies, the God of Israel:  The daughter  of Babylon is like a threshing floor at the time when it  is trodden; yet a little while, and the time of harvest shall  come for her.
051:034 Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon has devoured me, he has  crushed me, he has made me an empty vessel, he has, like a monster,  swallowed me up, he has filled his maw with my delicacies;  he has cast me out.
051:035 The violence done to me and to my flesh be on Babylon,  shall the inhabitant of Zion say; and, My blood be on  the inhabitants of Chaldea, shall Jerusalem say.
051:036 Therefore thus says Yahweh:  Behold, I will plead your cause,  and take vengeance for you; and I will dry up her sea,  and make her fountain dry.
051:037 Babylon shall become heaps, a dwelling place for jackals,  an astonishment, and a hissing, without inhabitant.
051:038 They shall roar together like young lions; they shall growl  as lions' cubs.
051:039 When they are heated, I will make their feast, and I will make  them drunken, that they may rejoice, and sleep a perpetual sleep,  and not wake, says Yahweh.
051:040 I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter, like rams  with male goats.
051:041 How is Sheshach taken! and the praise of the whole earth seized!  how is Babylon become a desolation among the nations!
051:042 The sea is come up on Babylon; she is covered with the multitude  of the waves of it.
051:043 Her cities are become a desolation, a dry land, and a desert,  a land in which no man dwells, neither does any son of  man pass thereby.
051:044 I will execute judgment on Bel in Babylon, and I will bring  forth out of his mouth that which he has swallowed up;  and the nations shall not flow any more to him:  yes, the wall  of Babylon shall fall.
051:045 My people, go you out of the midst of her, and save yourselves  every man from the fierce anger of Yahweh.
051:046 Don't let your heart faint, neither fear for the news that  shall be heard in the land; for news shall come one year,  and after that in another year [shall come] news, and violence  in the land, ruler against ruler.
051:047 Therefore, behold, the days come, that I will execute judgment  on the engraved images of Babylon; and her whole land shall  be confounded; and all her slain shall fall in the midst of her.
051:048 Then the heavens and the earth, and all that is therein,  shall sing for joy over Babylon; for the destroyers shall  come to her from the north, says Yahweh.
051:049 As Babylon has caused the slain of Israel to fall, so at Babylon  shall fall the slain of all the land.
051:050 You who have escaped the sword, go you, don't stand still;  remember Yahweh from afar, and let Jerusalem come into your mind.
051:051 We are confounded, because we have heard reproach; confusion has  covered our faces:  for strangers are come into the sanctuaries  of Yahweh's house.
051:052 Therefore, behold, the days come, says Yahweh, that I will  execute judgment on her engraved images; and through all her  land the wounded shall groan.
051:053 Though Babylon should mount up to the sky, and though she  should fortify the height of her strength, yet from me shall  destroyers come to her, says Yahweh.
051:054 The sound of a cry from Babylon, and of great destruction  from the land of the Chaldeans!
051:055 For Yahweh lays Babylon waste, and destroys out of her  the great voice; and their waves roar like many waters;  the noise of their voice is uttered:
051:056 for the destroyer is come on her, even on Babylon, and her  mighty men are taken, their bows are broken in pieces;  for Yahweh is a God of recompenses, he will surely requite.
051:057 I will make drunk her princes and her wise men, her governors  and her deputies, and her mighty men; and they shall sleep  a perpetual sleep, and not wake up, says the King, whose name  is Yahweh of Armies.
051:058 Thus says Yahweh of Armies:  The broad walls of Babylon  shall be utterly overthrown, and her high gates shall be  burned with fire; and the peoples shall labor for vanity,  and the nations for the fire; and they shall be weary.
051:059 The word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son  of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, when he went with Zedekiah  the king of Judah to Babylon in the fourth year of his reign.  Now Seraiah was chief quartermaster.
051:060 Jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that should come on Babylon,  even all these words that are written concerning Babylon.
051:061 Jeremiah said to Seraiah, When you come to Babylon, then see  that you read all these words,
051:062 and say, Yahweh, you have spoken concerning this place, to cut  it off, that none shall dwell therein, neither man nor animal,  but that it shall be desolate forever.
051:063 It shall be, when you have made an end of reading this book,  that you shall bind a stone to it, and cast it into the midst  of the Euphrates:
051:064 and you shall say, Thus shall Babylon sink, and shall not  rise again because of the evil that I will bring on her;  and they shall be weary.  Thus far are the words of Jeremiah.
052:016 But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left of the poorest  of the land to be vineyard keepers and farmers.
052:017 The pillars of brass that were in the house of Yahweh,  and the bases and the bronze sea that were in the house of Yahweh,  did the Chaldeans break in pieces, and carried all the brass  of them to Babylon.
052:018 The pots also, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the basins,  and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass with which  they ministered, took they away.
052:019 The cups, and the fire pans, and the basins, and the pots,  and the lampstands, and the spoons, and the bowls--  that which was of gold, in gold, and that which was of silver,  in silver,--the captain of the guard took away.
052:020 The two pillars, the one sea, and the twelve bronze bulls  that were under the bases, which king Solomon had made  for the house of Yahweh.  The brass of all these vessels  was without weight.
052:021 As for the pillars, the height of the one pillar was  eighteen cubits; and a line of twelve cubits did compass it;  and the thickness of it was four fingers:  it was hollow.
052:022 A capital of brass was on it; and the height of the one capital  was five cubits, with network and pomegranates on the capital  round about, all of brass:  and the second pillar also had  like these, and pomegranates.
052:023 There were ninety-six pomegranates on the sides; all the  pomegranates were one hundred on the network round about.
052:024 The captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest,  and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers  of the threshold:
052:025 and out of the city he took an officer who was set over the men  of war; and seven men of those who saw the king's face,  who were found in the city; and the scribe of the captain  of the army, who mustered the people of the land; and sixty  men of the people of the land, who were found in the midst  of the city.
052:026 Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them, and brought  them to the king of Babylon to Riblah.
052:027 The king of Babylon struck them, and put them to death at Riblah  in the land of Hamath.  So Judah was carried away captive  out of his land.
052:028 This is the people whom Nebuchadnezzar carried away captive:  in the seventh year three thousand twenty-three Jews;
052:029 in the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar he carried away  captive from Jerusalem eight hundred thirty-two persons;
052:030 in the three and twentieth year of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuzaradan  the captain of the guard carried away captive of the Jews  seven hundred forty-five persons:  all the persons were four  thousand and six hundred.
052:031 It happened in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity  of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month,  in the five and twentieth day of the month, that Evilmerodach  king of Babylon, in the [first] year of his reign, lifted up  the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah, and brought him forth  out of prison;
052:032 and he spoke kindly to him, and set his throne above the throne  of the kings who were with him in Babylon,
052:033 and changed his prison garments.  [Jehoiachin] ate bread  before him continually all the days of his life:
052:034 and for his allowance, there was a continual allowance given  him by the king of Babylon, every day a portion until the day  of his death, all the days of his life.Book 25 Lamentations
003:052 They have chased me sore like a bird, those who are my  enemies without cause.
003:053 They have cut off my life in the dungeon, and have cast  a stone on me.
003:054 Waters flowed over my head; I said, I am cut off.
003:055 I called on your name, Yahweh, out of the lowest dungeon.
003:056 You heard my voice; don't hide your ear at my breathing,  at my cry.
003:057 You drew near in the day that I called on you; you said,  Don't be afraid.
003:058 Lord, you have pleaded the causes of my soul; you have  redeemed my life.
003:059 Yahweh, you have seen my wrong; judge you my cause.
003:060 You have seen all their vengeance and all their devices against me.
003:061 You have heard their reproach, Yahweh, and all their  devices against me,
003:062 The lips of those that rose up against me, and their device  against me all the day.
003:063 See you their sitting down, and their rising up; I am their song.
003:064 You will render to them a recompense, Yahweh, according to  the work of their hands.
003:065 You will give them hardness of heart, your curse to them.
003:066 You will pursue them in anger, and destroy them from under  the heavens of Yahweh.
016:051 Neither has Samaria committed half of your sins; but you have  multiplied your abominations more than they, and have justified  your sisters by all your abominations which you have done.
016:052 You also, bear you your own shame, in that you have given judgment  for your sisters; through your sins that you have committed  more abominable than they, they are more righteous that you:  yes, be also confounded, and bear your shame, in that you  have justified your sisters.
016:053 I will turn again their captivity, the captivity of Sodom and  her daughters, and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters,  and the captivity of your captives in the midst of them;
016:054 that you may bear your own shame, and may be ashamed because  of all that you have done, in that you are a comfort to them.
016:055 Your sisters, Sodom and her daughters, shall return to their  former estate; and Samaria and her daughters shall return  to their former estate; and you and your daughters shall  return to your former estate.
016:056 For your sister Sodom was not mentioned by your mouth in the day  of your pride,
016:057 before your wickedness was uncovered, as at the time of the  reproach of the daughters of Syria, and of all who are round  about her, the daughters of the Philistines, who do despite  to you round about.
016:058 You have borne your lewdness and your abominations, says Yahweh.
016:059 For thus says the Lord Yahweh:  I will also deal with you as you  have done, who have despised the oath in breaking the covenant.
016:060 Nevertheless I will remember my covenant with you in the days  of your youth, and I will establish to you an everlasting covenant.
016:061 Then shall you remember your ways, and be ashamed,  when you shall receive your sisters, your elder [sisters]  and your younger; and I will give them to you for daughters,  but not by your covenant.
016:062 I will establish my covenant with you; and you shall know  that I am Yahweh;
016:063 that you may remember, and be confounded, and never open your  mouth any more, because of your shame, when I have forgiven  you all that you have done, says the Lord Yahweh.
020:049 Then said I, Ah Lord Yahweh! they say of me, Isn't he a  speaker of parables?
023:045 The sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was torn in two.
023:046 Jesus, crying with a loud voice, said, "Father, into your hands  I commit my spirit!"  Having said this, he breathed his last.
023:047 When the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying,  "Certainly this was a righteous man."
023:048 All the multitudes that came together to see this, when they saw  the things that were done, returned home beating their breasts.
023:049 All his acquaintances, and the women who followed with him  from Galilee, stood at a distance, watching these things.
040:039 In the porch of the gate were two tables on this side,  and two tables on that side, to kill thereon the burnt offering  and the sin offering and the trespass offering.
040:040 On the [one] side outside, as one goes up to the entry of the gate  toward the north, were two tables; and on the other side,  which belonged to the porch of the gate, were two tables.
040:041 Four tables were on this side, and four tables on that side,  by the side of the gate; eight tables, whereupon they  killed [the sacrifices].
040:042 There were four tables for the burnt offering, of hewn stone,  a cubit and a half long, and a cubit and a half broad,  and one cubit high; whereupon they laid the instruments  with which they killed the burnt offering and the sacrifice.
040:043 The hooks, a handbreadth long, were fastened within round about:  and on the tables was the flesh of the offering.
040:044 Outside of the inner gate were chambers for the singers  in the inner court, which was at the side of the north gate;  and their prospect was toward the south; one at the side  of the east gate having the prospect toward the north.
040:045 He said to me, This chamber, whose prospect is toward the south,  is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the house;
040:046 and the chamber whose prospect is toward the north is  for the priests, the keepers of the charge of the altar:  these are the sons of Zadok, who from among the sons of Levi  come near to Yahweh to minister to him.
040:047 He measured the court, one hundred cubits long, and a hundred  cubits broad, foursquare; and the altar was before the house.
040:048 Then he brought me to the porch of the house, and measured each  post of the porch, five cubits on this side, and five cubits  on that side:  and the breadth of the gate was three cubits  on this side, and three cubits on that side.
040:049 The length of the porch was twenty cubits, and the breadth  eleven cubits; even by the steps by which they went up to it:  and there were pillars by the posts, one on this side,  and another on that side.
005:034 But one stood up in the council, a Pharisee named Gamaliel,  a teacher of the law, honored by all the people, and commanded  to put the apostles out for a little while.
005:035 He said to them, "You men of Israel, be careful concerning  these men, what you are about to do.
005:036 For before these days Theudas rose up, making himself out  to be somebody; to whom a number of men, about four hundred,  joined themselves:  who was slain; and all, as many as obeyed him,  were dispersed, and came to nothing.
005:037 After this man, Judas of Galilee rose up in the days  of the enrollment, and drew away some people after him.  He also perished, and all, as many as obeyed him,  were scattered abroad.
005:038 Now I tell you, withdraw from these men, and leave them alone.  For if this counsel or this work is of men, it will be overthrown.
005:039 But if it is of God, you will not be able to overthrow it,  and you would be found even to be fighting against God!"
005:040 They agreed with him.  Summoning the apostles, they beat  them and charged them not to speak in the name of Jesus,  and let them go.
005:041 They therefore departed from the presence of the council,  rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer dishonor  for Jesus' name.
005:042 Every day, in the temple and at home, they never stopped  teaching and preaching Jesus, the Christ.
005:043 I have come in my Father's name, and you don't receive me.  If another comes in his own name, you will receive him.
005:044 How can you believe, who receive glory from one another,  and you don't seek the glory that comes from the only God?
005:045 "Don't think that I will accuse you to the Father.  There is one who accuses you, even Moses, on whom you have  set your hope.
005:046 For if you believed Moses, you would believe me;  for he wrote about me.
005:047 But if you don't believe his writings, how will you  believe my words?"
005:048 Therefore you shall be perfect, just as your Father in  heaven is perfect.
021:046 When they sought to seize him, they feared the multitudes,  because they considered him to be a prophet.
026:066 What do you think?"  They answered, "He is worthy of death!"
026:067 Then they spit in his face and beat him with their fists,  and some slapped him,
026:068 saying, "Prophesy to us, you Christ!  Who hit you?"
026:069 Now Peter was sitting outside in the court, and a maid came  to him, saying, "You were also with Jesus, the Galilean!"
026:070 But he denied it before them all, saying, "I don't know what you  are talking about."
026:071 When he had gone out onto the porch, someone else saw him,  and said to those who were there, "This man also was with  Jesus of Nazareth."
026:072 Again he denied it with an oath, "I don't know the man."
026:073 After a little while those who stood by came and said  to Peter, "Surely you are also one of them, for your speech  makes you known."
026:074 Then he began to curse and to swear, "I don't know the man!"  Immediately the rooster crowed.
026:075 Peter remembered the word which Jesus had said to him,  "Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times."  He went out and wept bitterly.
027:047 Some of them who stood there, when they heard it, said, "This man  is calling Elijah."
027:048 Immediately one of them ran, and took a sponge, and filled it  with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave him a drink.
027:049 The rest said, "Let him be.  Let's see whether Elijah comes  to save him."
027:050 Jesus cried again with a loud voice, and yielded up his spirit.
027:051 Behold, the veil of the temple was torn in two from the top  to the bottom.  The earth quaked and the rocks were split.
027:052 The tombs were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had  fallen asleep were raised;
027:053 and coming out of the tombs after his resurrection, they entered  into the holy city and appeared to many.
027:054 Now the centurion, and those who were with him watching Jesus,  when they saw the earthquake, and the things that were done,  feared exceedingly, saying, "Truly this was the Son of God."
027:055 Many women were there watching from afar, who had followed  Jesus from Galilee, serving him.
027:056 Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joses,  and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.
027:057 When evening had come, a rich man from Arimathaea, named Joseph,  who himself was also Jesus' disciple came.
027:058 This man went to Pilate, and asked for Jesus' body.  Then Pilate  commanded the body to be given up.
027:059 Joseph took the body, and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,
027:060 and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in the rock,  and he rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb, and departed.
027:061 Mary Magdalene was there, and the other Mary, sitting  opposite the tomb.
027:062 Now on the next day, which was the day after the Preparation Day,  the chief priests and the Pharisees were gathered together to Pilate,
027:063 saying, "Sir, we remember what that deceiver said while he was  still alive:  'After three days I will rise again.'
027:064 Command therefore that the tomb be made secure until the third day,  lest perhaps his disciples come at night and steal him away,  and tell the people, 'He is risen from the dead;' and the last  deception will be worse than the first."
027:065 Pilate said to them, "You have a guard.  Go, make it as secure  as you can."
027:066 So they went with the guard and made the tomb secure,  sealing the stone.
010:045 They of the circumcision who believed were amazed, as many  as came with Peter, because the gift of the Holy Spirit was  also poured out on the nations.
010:046 For they heard them speaking in other languages and magnifying God.  Then Peter answered,
010:047 "Can any man forbid the water, that these who have received  the Holy Spirit as well as we should not be baptized?"
010:048 He commanded them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ.  Then they asked him to stay some days.
010:049 Jesus stood still, and said, "Call him."  They called  the blind man, saying to him, "Cheer up!  Get up.  He is calling you!"
010:050 He, casting away his cloak, sprang up, and came to Jesus.
010:051 Jesus asked him, "What do you want me to do for you?"  The blind man said to him, "Rhabboni,{Rhabboni is a transliteration  of the Hebrew word for "great teacher."} that I may see again."
010:052 Jesus said to him, "Go your way.  Your faith has made you well."  Immediately he received his sight, and followed Jesus  in the way.
014:058 "We heard him say, 'I will destroy this temple that is  made with hands, and in three days I will build another  made without hands.'"
014:059 Even so, their testimony did not agree.
014:060 The high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus, "Have you  no answer?  What is it which these testify against you?"
014:061 But he stayed quiet, and answered nothing.  Again the high priest  asked him, "Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?"
014:062 Jesus said, "I am.  You will see the Son of Man sitting  at the right hand of Power, and coming with the clouds  of the sky."
014:063 The high priest tore his clothes, and said, "What further need  have we of witnesses?
014:064 You have heard the blasphemy!  What do you think?"  They all condemned him to be worthy of death.
014:065 Some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to beat  him with fists, and to tell him, "Prophesy!"  The officers  struck him with the palms of their hands.
014:066 As Peter was in the courtyard below, one of the maids of  the high priest came,
014:067 and seeing Peter warming himself, she looked at him, and said,  "You were also with the Nazarene, Jesus!"
014:068 But he denied it, saying, "I neither know, nor understand what you  are saying."  He went out on the porch, and the rooster crowed.
014:069 The maid saw him, and began again to tell those who stood by,  "This is one of them."
014:070 But he again denied it.  After a little while again those  who stood by said to Peter, "You truly are one of them,  for you are a Galilean, and your speech shows it."
014:071 But he began to curse, and to swear, "I don't know this man  of whom you speak!"
014:072 The rooster crowed the second time.  Peter remembered the word,  how that Jesus said to him, "Before the rooster crows twice,  you will deny me three times."  When he thought about that, he wept.
001:055 As he spoke to our fathers, to Abraham and his seed forever."
001:056 Mary stayed with her about three months, and then returned  to her house.
001:057 Now the time that Elizabeth should give birth was fulfilled,  and she brought forth a son.
001:058 Her neighbors and her relatives heard that the Lord had magnified  his mercy towards her, and they rejoiced with her.
001:059 It happened on the eighth day, that they came to circumcise  the child; and they would have called him Zacharias,  after the name of the father.
001:060 His mother answered, "Not so; but he will be called John."
001:061 They said to her, "There is no one among your relatives who is  called by this name."
001:062 They made signs to his father, what he would have him called.
001:063 He asked for a writing tablet, and wrote, "His name is John."  They all marveled.
001:064 His mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue freed,  and he spoke, blessing God.
001:065 Fear came on all who lived around them, and all these sayings  were talked about throughout all the hill country of Judea.
001:066 All who heard them laid them up in their heart, saying, "What then  will this child be?"  The hand of the Lord was with him.
001:067 His father, Zacharias, was filled with the Holy Spirit,  and prophesied, saying,
001:068 "Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, for he has visited  and worked redemption for his people;
001:069 and has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house  of his servant David
001:070 (as he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets who have been  from of old),
001:071 salvation from our enemies, and from the hand of all who hate us;
001:072 to show mercy towards our fathers, to remember his holy covenant,
001:073 the oath which he spoke to Abraham, our father,
001:074 to grant to us that we, being delivered out of the hand  of our enemies, should serve him without fear,
001:075 In holiness and righteousness before him all the days of our life.
001:076 And you, child, will be called a prophet of the Most High,  for you will go before the face of the Lord to make ready his ways,
001:077 to give knowledge of salvation to his people by the remission  of their sins,
001:078 because of the tender mercy of our God, whereby the dawn  from on high will visit us,
001:079 to shine on those who sit in darkness and the shadow of death;  to guide our feet into the way of peace."
001:080 The child was growing, and becoming strong in spirit, and was  in the desert until the day of his public appearance to Israel.
009:058 Jesus said to him, "The foxes have holes, and the birds of the sky  have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head."
009:059 He said to another, "Follow me!"  But he said, "Lord, allow me  first to go and bury my father."
009:060 But Jesus said to him, "Leave the dead to bury their own dead,  but you go and announce the Kingdom of God."
009:061 Another also said, "I want to follow you, Lord, but first allow  me to bid farewell to those who are at my house."
009:062 But Jesus said to him, "No one, having put his hand to the plow,  and looking back, is fit for the Kingdom of God."
011:048 If we leave him alone like this, everyone will believe in him,  and the Romans will come and take away both our place  and our nation."
011:049 But a certain one of them, Caiaphas, being high priest that year,  said to them, "You know nothing at all,
011:050 nor do you consider that it is advantageous for us that one man  should die for the people, and that the whole nation not perish."
011:051 Now he didn't say this of himself, but being high priest that year,  he prophesied that Jesus would die for the nation,
011:052 and not for the nation only, but that he might also gather  together into one the children of God who are scattered abroad.
011:053 So from that day forward they took counsel that they might put  him to death.
011:054 Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews,  but departed from there into the country near the wilderness,  to a city called Ephraim.  He stayed there with his disciples.
012:052 For from now on, there will be five in one house divided,  three against two, and two against three.
012:053 They will be divided, father against son, and son against father;  mother against daughter, and daughter against her mother;  mother-in-law against her daughter-in-law, and daughter-in-law  against her mother-in-law."
012:054 He said to the multitudes also, "When you see a cloud rising  from the west, immediately you say, 'A shower is coming,'  and so it happens.
012:055 When a south wind blows, you say, 'There will be a scorching heat,'  and it happens.
012:056 You hypocrites!  You know how to interpret the appearance  of the earth and the sky, but how is it that you don't  interpret this time?
012:057 Why don't you judge for yourselves what is right?
012:058 For when you are going with your adversary before the magistrate,  try diligently on the way to be released from him, lest perhaps  he drag you to the judge, and the judge deliver you to the officer,  and the officer throw you into prison.
012:059 I tell you, you will by no means get out of there,  until you have paid the very last penny.{literally, lepton.  A lepton is a very small brass Jewish coin worth half a Roman  quadrans each, which is worth a quarter of the copper assarion.  Lepta are worth less than 1% of an agricultural  worker's daily wages.}"
022:054 They seized him, and led him away, and brought him into the high  priest's house.  But Peter followed from a distance.
022:055 When they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard,  and had sat down together, Peter sat among them.
022:056 A certain servant girl saw him as he sat in the light,  and looking intently at him, said, "This man also was with him."
022:057 He denied Jesus, saying, "Woman, I don't know him."
022:058 After a little while someone else saw him, and said, "You also  are one of them!"  But Peter answered, "Man, I am not!"
022:059 After about one hour passed, another confidently affirmed, saying,  "Truly this man also was with him, for he is a Galilean!"
022:060 But Peter said, "Man, I don't know what you are talking about!"  Immediately, while he was still speaking, a rooster crowed.
022:061 The Lord turned, and looked at Peter.  Then Peter remembered  the Lord's word, how he said to him, "Before the rooster  crows you will deny me three times."
022:062 He went out, and wept bitterly.
022:063 The men who held Jesus mocked him and beat him.
022:064 Having blindfolded him, they struck him on the face and  asked him, "Prophesy!  Who is the one who struck you?"
022:065 They spoke many other things against him, insulting him.
022:066 As soon as it was day, the assembly of the elders of the people  was gathered together, both chief priests and scribes,  and they led him away into their council, saying,
022:067 "If you are the Christ, tell us."  But he said to them,  "If I tell you, you won't believe,
022:068 and if I ask, you will in no way answer me or let me go.
022:069 From now on, the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand  of the power of God."
022:070 They all said, "Are you then the Son of God?"  He said to them,  "You say it, because I am."
022:071 They said, "Why do we need any more witness?  For we ourselves  have heard from his own mouth!"
023:050 Behold, a man named Joseph, who was a member of the council,  a good and righteous man
023:051 (he had not consented to their counsel and deed), from Arimathaea,  a city of the Jews, who was also waiting for the Kingdom of God:
023:052 this man went to Pilate, and asked for Jesus' body.
023:053 He took it down, and wrapped it in a linen cloth, and laid him  in a tomb that was cut in stone, where no one had ever been laid.
023:054 It was the day of the Preparation, and the Sabbath was drawing near.
023:055 The women, who had come with him out of Galilee, followed after,  and saw the tomb, and how his body was laid.
023:056 They returned, and prepared spices and ointments.  On the Sabbath they rested according to the commandment.
004:050 Jesus said to him, "Go your way.  Your son lives."  The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him,  and he went his way.
004:051 As he was now going down, his servants met him and reported,  saying "Your child lives!"
004:052 So he inquired of them the hour when he began to get better.  They said therefore to him, "Yesterday at the seventh hour,{1:00  P. M.} the fever left him."
004:053 So the father knew that it was at that hour in which Jesus said  to him, "Your son lives."  He believed, as did his whole house.
004:054 This is again the second sign that Jesus did, having come  out of Judea into Galilee.
011:055 Now the Passover of the Jews was at hand.  Many went  up from the country to Jerusalem before the Passover,  to purify themselves.
011:056 Then they sought for Jesus and spoke one with another,  as they stood in the temple, "What do you think--that he isn't  coming to the feast at all?"
011:057 Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had commanded  that if anyone knew where he was, he should report it,  that they might seize him.
  2:14}
  1:2-3}
  8:6} But when he says, "All things are put in subjection,"  it is evident that he is excepted who subjected all things to him.
  8:4-6} For in that he subjected all things to him, he left  nothing that is not subject to him.  But now we don't see  all things subjected to him, yet.
  8:14} For they stumble at the word, being disobedient,  to which also they were appointed.
