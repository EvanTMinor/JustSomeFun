Book 01 Genesis

001:001 In the beginning God{After "God," the Hebrew has the two letters

        "Aleph Tav" (the first and last letters of the Hebrew alphabet)

        as a grammatical marker.} created the heavens and the earth.

001:002 Now the earth was formless and empty.  Darkness was on the surface

        of the deep.  God's Spirit was hovering over the surface

        of the waters.

001:003 God said, "Let there be light," and there was light.

001:004 God saw the light, and saw that it was good.  God divided

        the light from the darkness.

001:005 God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night.

        There was evening and there was morning, one day.

001:006 God said, "Let there be an expanse in the middle of the waters,

        and let it divide the waters from the waters."

001:007 God made the expanse, and divided the waters which were under

        the expanse from the waters which were above the expanse;

        and it was so.

001:008 God called the expanse sky.  There was evening and there

        was morning, a second day.

001:009 God said, "Let the waters under the sky be gathered together

        to one place, and let the dry land appear;" and it was so.

001:010 God called the dry land Earth, and the gathering together

        of the waters he called Seas.  God saw that it was good.

001:011 God said, "Let the earth put forth grass, herbs yielding seed,

        and fruit trees bearing fruit after their kind, with its seed

        in it, on the earth;" and it was so.

001:012 The earth brought forth grass, herbs yielding seed after their kind,

        and trees bearing fruit, with its seed in it, after their kind;

        and God saw that it was good.

001:013 There was evening and there was morning, a third day.

001:014 God said, "Let there be lights in the expanse of sky to

        divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs,

        and for seasons, and for days and years;

001:015 and let them be for lights in the expanse of sky to give light

        on the earth;" and it was so.

001:016 God made the two great lights:  the greater light to rule

        the day, and the lesser light to rule the night.

        He also made the stars.

001:017 God set them in the expanse of sky to give light to the earth,

001:018 and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide

        the light from the darkness.  God saw that it was good.

001:019 There was evening and there was morning, a fourth day.

001:020 God said, "Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures,

        and let birds fly above the earth in the open expanse of sky."

001:021 God created the large sea creatures, and every living

        creature that moves, with which the waters swarmed,

        after their kind, and every winged bird after its kind.

        God saw that it was good.

001:022 God blessed them, saying, "Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill

        the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth."

001:023 There was evening and there was morning, a fifth day.

001:024 God said, "Let the earth bring forth living creatures after

        their kind, livestock, creeping things, and animals of the earth

        after their kind;" and it was so.

001:025 God made the animals of the earth after their kind,

        and the livestock after their kind, and everything that creeps

        on the ground after its kind.  God saw that it was good.

001:026 God said, "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness:

        and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea,

        and over the birds of the sky, and over the livestock,

        and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that

        creeps on the earth."

001:027 God created man in his own image.  In God's image he created him;

        male and female he created them.

001:028 God blessed them.  God said to them, "Be fruitful, multiply,

        fill the earth, and subdue it.  Have dominion over the fish

        of the sea, over the birds of the sky, and over every living

        thing that moves on the earth."

001:029 God said, "Behold, I have given you every herb yielding seed,

        which is on the surface of all the earth, and every tree,

        which bears fruit yielding seed.  It will be your food.

001:030 To every animal of the earth, and to every bird of the sky,

        and to everything that creeps on the earth, in which there is life,

        I have given every green herb for food;" and it was so.

001:031 God saw everything that he had made, and, behold, it was very good.

        There was evening and there was morning, a sixth day.

002:001 The heavens and the earth were finished, and all their vast array.

002:002 On the seventh day God finished his work which he had made;

        and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which

        he had made.

002:003 God blessed the seventh day, and made it holy, because he rested

        in it from all his work which he had created and made.

002:004 This is the history of the generations of the heavens and of

        the earth when they were created, in the day that Yahweh God

        made the earth and the heavens.

002:005 No plant of the field was yet in the earth, and no herb of

        the field had yet sprung up; for Yahweh God had not caused it

        to rain on the earth.  There was not a man to till the ground,

002:006 but a mist went up from the earth, and watered the whole

        surface of the ground.

002:007 Yahweh God formed man from the dust of the ground,

        and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man

        became a living soul.

002:008 Yahweh God planted a garden eastward, in Eden, and there he put

        the man whom he had formed.

002:009 Out of the ground Yahweh God made every tree to grow that is

        pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of life

        also in the middle of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge

        of good and evil.

002:010 A river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from there

        it was parted, and became four heads.

002:011 The name of the first is Pishon:  this is the one which flows

        through the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;

002:012 and the gold of that land is good.  There is aromatic resin

        and the onyx stone.

002:013 The name of the second river is Gihon:  the same river that flows

        through the whole land of Cush.

002:014 The name of the third river is Hiddekel:  this is the one which

        flows in front of Assyria.  The fourth river is the Euphrates.

002:015 Yahweh God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden

        to dress it and to keep it.

002:016 Yahweh God commanded the man, saying, "Of every tree of the garden

        you may freely eat;

002:017 but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, you shall

        not eat of it; for in the day that you eat of it you

        will surely die."

002:018 Yahweh God said, "It is not good that the man should be alone;

        I will make him a helper suitable for him."

002:019 Out of the ground Yahweh God formed every animal of the field,

        and every bird of the sky, and brought them to the man to see

        what he would call them.  Whatever the man called every

        living creature, that was its name.

002:020 The man gave names to all livestock, and to the birds of the sky,

        and to every animal of the field; but for man there was not

        found a helper suitable for him.

002:021 Yahweh God caused a deep sleep to fall on the man, and he slept;

        and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh

        in its place.

002:022 He made the rib, which Yahweh God had taken from the man,

        into a woman, and brought her to the man.

002:023 The man said, "This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh.

        She will be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man."

002:024 Therefore a man will leave his father and his mother,

        and will join with his wife, and they will be one flesh.

002:025 They were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.

003:001 Now the serpent was more subtle than any animal of the field

        which Yahweh God had made.  He said to the woman, "Has God

        really said, 'You shall not eat of any tree of the garden?'"

003:002 The woman said to the serpent, "Of the fruit of the trees

        of the garden we may eat,

003:003 but of the fruit of the tree which is in the middle of the garden,

        God has said, 'You shall not eat of it, neither shall you

        touch it, lest you die.'"

003:004 The serpent said to the woman, "You won't surely die,

003:005 for God knows that in the day you eat it, your eyes will be opened,

        and you will be like God, knowing good and evil."

003:006 When the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it

        was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired

        to make one wise, she took of the fruit of it, and ate;

        and she gave some to her husband with her, and he ate.

003:007 The eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew

        that they were naked.  They sewed fig leaves together,

        and made themselves aprons.

003:008 They heard the voice of Yahweh God walking in the garden in

        the cool of the day, and the man and his wife hid themselves

        from the presence of Yahweh God among the trees of the garden.

003:009 Yahweh God called to the man, and said to him, "Where are you?"

003:010 The man said, "I heard your voice in the garden, and I was afraid,

        because I was naked; and I hid myself."

003:011 God said, "Who told you that you were naked?  Have you eaten

        from the tree that I commanded you not to eat from?"

003:012 The man said, "The woman whom you gave to be with me,

        she gave me of the tree, and I ate."

003:013 Yahweh God said to the woman, "What is this you have done?"

        The woman said, "The serpent deceived me, and I ate."

003:014 Yahweh God said to the serpent, "Because you have done this,

        cursed are you above all livestock, and above every animal

        of the field.  On your belly shall you go, and you shall eat

        dust all the days of your life.

003:015 I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your

        offspring and her offspring.  He will bruise your head,

        and you will bruise his heel."

003:016 To the woman he said, "I will greatly multiply your pain

        in childbirth.  In pain you will bring forth children.

        Your desire will be for your husband, and he will rule over you."

003:017 To Adam he said, "Because you have listened to your wife's voice,

        and have eaten of the tree, of which I commanded you, saying,

        'You shall not eat of it,' cursed is the ground for your sake.

        In toil you will eat of it all the days of your life.

003:018 Thorns also and thistles will it bring forth to you;

        and you will eat the herb of the field.

003:019 By the sweat of your face will you eat bread until you

        return to the ground, for out of it you were taken.

        For you are dust, and to dust you shall return."

003:020 The man called his wife Eve, because she was the mother

        of all living.

003:021 Yahweh God made coats of skins for Adam and for his wife,

        and clothed them.

003:022 Yahweh God said, "Behold, the man has become like one of us,

        knowing good and evil.  Now, lest he put forth his hand,

        and also take of the tree of life, and eat, and live forever..."

003:023 Therefore Yahweh God sent him forth from the garden of Eden,

        to till the ground from which he was taken.

003:024 So he drove out the man; and he placed Cherubs at the east

        of the garden of Eden, and the flame of a sword which turned

        every way, to guard the way to the tree of life.

004:001 The man knew Eve his wife.  She conceived, and gave birth to Cain,

        and said, "I have gotten a man with Yahweh's help."

004:002 Again she gave birth, to Cain's brother Abel.  Abel was a keeper

        of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.

004:003 As time passed, it happened that Cain brought an offering

        to Yahweh from the fruit of the ground.

004:004 Abel also brought some of the firstborn of his flock and of

        the fat of it.  Yahweh respected Abel and his offering,

004:005 but he didn't respect Cain and his offering.  Cain was very angry,

        and the expression on his face fell.

004:006 Yahweh said to Cain, "Why are you angry?  Why has the expression

        of your face fallen?

004:007 If you do well, will it not be lifted up?  If you don't do well,

        sin crouches at the door.  Its desire is for you, but you

        are to rule over it."

004:008 Cain said to Abel, his brother, "Let's go into the field."

        It happened when they were in the field, that Cain rose up

        against Abel, his brother, and killed him.

004:009 Yahweh said to Cain, "Where is Abel, your brother?"

        He said, "I don't know.  Am I my brother's keeper?"

004:010 Yahweh said, "What have you done?  The voice of your brother's

        blood cries to me from the ground.

004:011 Now you are cursed because of the ground, which has opened

        its mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand.

004:012 From now on, when you till the ground, it won't yield its

        strength to you.  You shall be a fugitive and a wanderer

        in the earth."

004:013 Cain said to Yahweh, "My punishment is greater than I can bear.

004:014 Behold, you have driven me out this day from the surface

        of the ground.  I will be hidden from your face,

        and I will be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth.

        It will happen that whoever finds me will kill me."

004:015 Yahweh said to him, "Therefore whoever slays Cain, vengeance will

        be taken on him sevenfold."  Yahweh appointed a sign for Cain,

        lest any finding him should strike him.

004:016 Cain went out from Yahweh's presence, and lived in the land

        of Nod, east of Eden.

004:017 Cain knew his wife.  She conceived, and gave birth to Enoch.

        He built a city, and called the name of the city, after the name

        of his son, Enoch.

004:018 To Enoch was born Irad.  Irad became the father of Mehujael.

        Mehujael became the father of Methushael.  Methushael became

        the father of Lamech.

004:019 Lamech took two wives:  the name of the one was Adah,

        and the name of the other Zillah.

004:020 Adah gave birth to Jabal, who was the father of those who dwell

        in tents and have livestock.

004:021 His brother's name was Jubal, who was the father of all who

        handle the harp and pipe.

004:022 Zillah also gave birth to Tubal Cain, the forger of every cutting

        instrument of brass and iron.  Tubal Cain's sister was Naamah.

004:023 Lamech said to his wives, "Adah and Zillah, hear my voice.

        You wives of Lamech, listen to my speech, for I have slain

        a man for wounding me, a young man for bruising me.

004:024 If Cain will be avenged seven times, truly Lamech

        seventy-seven times."

004:025 Adam knew his wife again.  She gave birth to a son, and named

        him Seth, "for God has appointed me another child instead

        of Abel, for Cain killed him."

004:026 There was also born a son to Seth, and he named him Enosh.

        Then men began to call on Yahweh's name.

005:001 This is the book of the generations of Adam.  In the day

        that God created man, he made him in God's likeness.

005:002 He created them male and female, and blessed them, and called

        their name Adam,{"Adam" and "Man" are spelled with the exact

        same consonants in Hebrew, so this can be correctly translated

        either way.} in the day when they were created.

005:003 Adam lived one hundred thirty years, and became the father of a

        son in his own likeness, after his image, and named him Seth.

005:004 The days of Adam after he became the father of Seth were eight

        hundred years, and he became the father of sons and daughters.

005:005 All the days that Adam lived were nine hundred thirty years,

        then he died.

005:006 Seth lived one hundred five years, and became the father of Enosh.

005:007 Seth lived after he became the father of Enosh eight hundred

        seven years, and became the father of sons and daughters.

005:008 All the days of Seth were nine hundred twelve years,

        then he died.

005:009 Enosh lived ninety years, and became the father of Kenan.

005:010 Enosh lived after he became the father of Kenan, eight hundred

        fifteen years, and became the father of sons and daughters.

005:011 All the days of Enosh were nine hundred five years, then he died.

005:012 Kenan lived seventy years, and became the father of Mahalalel.

005:013 Kenan lived after he became the father of Mahalalel eight hundred

        forty years, and became the father of sons and daughters

005:014 and all the days of Kenan were nine hundred ten years,

        then he died.

005:015 Mahalalel lived sixty-five years, and became the father of Jared.

005:016 Mahalalel lived after he became the father of Jared eight hundred

        thirty years, and became the father of sons and daughters.

005:017 All the days of Mahalalel were eight hundred ninety-five years,

        then he died.

005:018 Jared lived one hundred sixty-two years, and became

        the father of Enoch.

005:019 Jared lived after he became the father of Enoch eight hundred years,

        and became the father of sons and daughters.

005:020 All the days of Jared were nine hundred sixty-two years,

        then he died.

005:021 Enoch lived sixty-five years, and became the father of Methuselah.

005:022 Enoch walked with God after he became the father of Methuselah

        three hundred years, and became the father of sons and daughters.

005:023 All the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty-five years.

005:024 Enoch walked with God, and he was not, for God took him.

005:025 Methuselah lived one hundred eighty-seven years, and became

        the father of Lamech.

005:026 Methuselah lived after he became the father of Lamech seven hundred

        eighty-two years, and became the father of sons and daughters.

005:027 All the days of Methuselah were nine hundred sixty-nine years,

        then he died.

005:028 Lamech lived one hundred eighty-two years, and became the father

        of a son,

005:029 and he named him Noah, saying, "This same will comfort us

        in our work and in the toil of our hands, because of the ground

        which Yahweh has cursed."

005:030 Lamech lived after he became the father of Noah five hundred

        ninety-five years, and became the father of sons and daughters.

005:031 All the days of Lamech were seven hundred seventy-seven years,

        then he died.

005:032 Noah was five hundred years old, and Noah became the father

        of Shem, Ham, and Japheth.

006:001 It happened, when men began to multiply on the surface

        of the ground, and daughters were born to them,

006:002 that God's sons saw that men's daughters were beautiful,

        and they took for themselves wives of all that they chose.

006:003 Yahweh said, "My Spirit will not strive with man forever,

        because he also is flesh; yet will his days be one

        hundred twenty years."

006:004 The Nephilim were in the earth in those days, and also

        after that, when God's sons came in to men's daughters.

        They bore children to them.  Those were the mighty men

        who were of old, men of renown.

006:005 Yahweh saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth,

        and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was

        only evil continually.

006:006 Yahweh was sorry that he had made man on the earth, and it

        grieved him in his heart.

006:007 Yahweh said, "I will destroy man whom I have created

        from the surface of the ground; man, along with animals,

        creeping things, and birds of the sky; for I am sorry that I

        have made them."

006:008 But Noah found favor in Yahweh's eyes.

006:009 This is the history of the generations of Noah.  Noah was

        a righteous man, blameless among the people of his time.

        Noah walked with God.

006:010 Noah became the father of three sons:  Shem, Ham, and Japheth.

006:011 The earth was corrupt before God, and the earth was

        filled with violence.

006:012 God saw the earth, and saw that it was corrupt, for all flesh

        had corrupted their way on the earth.

006:013 God said to Noah, "The end of all flesh has come before me,

        for the earth is filled with violence through them.

        Behold, I will destroy them with the earth.

006:014 Make a ship of gopher wood.  You shall make rooms in the ship,

        and shall seal it inside and outside with pitch.

006:015 This is how you shall make it.  The length of the ship will

        be three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits,

        and the height of it thirty cubits.

006:016 You shall make a roof in the ship, and to a cubit shall you finish

        it upward.  You shall set the door of the ship in its side.

        You shall make it with lower, second, and third levels.

006:017 I, even I, do bring the flood of waters on this earth, to destroy

        all flesh having the breath of life from under the sky.

        Everything that is in the earth will die.

006:018 But I will establish my covenant with you.  You shall come

        into the ship, you, your sons, your wife, and your sons'

        wives with you.

006:019 Of every living thing of all flesh, you shall bring two

        of every sort into the ship, to keep them alive with you.

        They shall be male and female.

006:020 Of the birds after their kind, of the livestock after their kind,

        of every creeping thing of the ground after its kind,

        two of every sort shall come to you, to keep them alive.

006:021 Take with you of all food that is eaten, and gather it to you;

        and it will be for food for you, and for them."

006:022 Thus Noah did.  According to all that God commanded him,

        so he did.

007:001 Yahweh said to Noah, "Come with all of your household into

        the ship, for I have seen your righteousness before me

        in this generation.

007:002 You shall take seven pairs of every clean animal with you,

        the male and his female.  Of the animals that are not clean,

        take two, the male and his female.

007:003 Also of the birds of the sky, seven and seven, male and female,

        to keep seed alive on the surface of all the earth.

007:004 In seven days, I will cause it to rain on the earth for forty

        days and forty nights.  Every living thing that I have made,

        I will destroy from the surface of the ground."

007:005 Noah did everything that Yahweh commanded him.

007:006 Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters came

        on the earth.

007:007 Noah went into the ship with his sons, his wife, and his sons'

        wives, because of the waters of the flood.

007:008 Clean animals, animals that are not clean, birds, and everything

        that creeps on the ground

007:009 went by pairs to Noah into the ship, male and female,

        as God commanded Noah.

007:010 It happened after the seven days, that the waters of the flood

        came on the earth.

007:011 In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month,

        on the seventeenth day of the month, on the same day all

        the fountains of the great deep were burst open, and the sky's

        windows were opened.

007:012 The rain was on the earth forty days and forty nights.

007:013 In the same day Noah, and Shem, Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah,

        and Noah's wife, and the three wives of his sons with them,

        entered into the ship;

007:014 they, and every animal after its kind, all the livestock after

        their kind, every creeping thing that creeps on the earth

        after its kind, and every bird after its kind, every bird

        of every sort.

007:015 They went to Noah into the ship, by pairs of all flesh with

        the breath of life in them.

007:016 Those who went in, went in male and female of all flesh,

        as God commanded him; and Yahweh shut him in.

007:017 The flood was forty days on the earth.  The waters increased,

        and lifted up the ship, and it was lifted up above the earth.

007:018 The waters prevailed, and increased greatly on the earth;

        and the ship floated on the surface of the waters.

007:019 The waters prevailed exceedingly on the earth.  All the high

        mountains that were under the whole sky were covered.

007:020 The waters prevailed fifteen cubits upward, and the

        mountains were covered.

007:021 All flesh died that moved on the earth, including birds,

        livestock, animals, every creeping thing that creeps on the earth,

        and every man.

007:022 All in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of life,

        of all that was on the dry land, died.

007:023 Every living thing was destroyed that was on the surface

        of the ground, including man, livestock, creeping things,

        and birds of the sky.  They were destroyed from the earth.

        Only Noah was left, and those who were with him in the ship.

007:024 The waters prevailed on the earth one hundred fifty days.

008:001 God remembered Noah, all the animals, and all the livestock that were

        with him in the ship; and God made a wind to pass over the earth.

        The waters subsided.

008:002 The deep's fountains and the sky's windows were also stopped,

        and the rain from the sky was restrained.

008:003 The waters receded from the earth continually.  After the end

        of one hundred fifty days the waters decreased.

008:004 The ship rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day

        of the month, on Ararat's mountains.

008:005 The waters receded continually until the tenth month.

        In the tenth month, on the first day of the month, the tops

        of the mountains were seen.

008:006 It happened at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window

        of the ship which he had made,

008:007 and he sent forth a raven.  It went back and forth,

        until the waters were dried up from the earth.

008:008 He sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated

        from the surface of the ground,

008:009 but the dove found no place to rest her foot, and she returned

        to him into the ship; for the waters were on the surface

        of the whole earth.  He put forth his hand, and took her,

        and brought her to him into the ship.

008:010 He stayed yet another seven days; and again he sent forth

        the dove out of the ship.

008:011 The dove came back to him at evening, and, behold, in her mouth

        was an olive leaf plucked off.  So Noah knew that the waters

        were abated from the earth.

008:012 He stayed yet another seven days, and sent forth the dove;

        and she didn't return to him any more.

008:013 It happened in the six hundred first year, in the first month,

        the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from the earth.

        Noah removed the covering of the ship, and looked.

        He saw that the surface of the ground was dried.

008:014 In the second month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month,

        the earth was dry.

008:015 God spoke to Noah, saying,

008:016 "Go out of the ship, you, and your wife, and your sons,

        and your sons' wives with you.

008:017 Bring forth with you every living thing that is with you

        of all flesh, including birds, livestock, and every creeping

        thing that creeps on the earth, that they may breed abundantly

        in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply on the earth."

008:018 Noah went forth, with his sons, his wife, and his sons'

        wives with him.

008:019 Every animal, every creeping thing, and every bird, whatever moves

        on the earth, after their families, went out of the ship.

008:020 Noah built an altar to Yahweh, and took of every clean animal,

        and of every clean bird, and offered burnt offerings

        on the altar.

008:021 Yahweh smelled the sweet savor.  Yahweh said in his heart,

        "I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake,

        because the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth;

        neither will I ever again strike everything living,

        as I have done.

008:022 While the earth remains, seed time and harvest, and cold and heat,

        and summer and winter, and day and night shall not cease."

009:001 God blessed Noah and his sons, and said to them, "Be fruitful,

        and multiply, and replenish the earth.

009:002 The fear of you and the dread of you will be on every

        animal of the earth, and on every bird of the sky.

        Everything that the ground teems with, and all the fish

        of the sea are delivered into your hand.

009:003 Every moving thing that lives will be food for you.

        As the green herb, I have given everything to you.

009:004 But flesh with the life of it, the blood of it, you shall not eat.

009:005 I will surely require your blood of your lives.

        At the hand of every animal I will require it.

        At the hand of man, even at the hand of every man's brother,

        I will require the life of man.

009:006 Whoever sheds man's blood, his blood will be shed by man,

        for God made man in his own image.

009:007 Be fruitful and multiply.  Bring forth abundantly in the earth,

        and multiply in it."

009:008 God spoke to Noah and to his sons with him, saying,

009:009 "As for me, behold, I establish my covenant with you,

        and with your offspring after you,

009:010 and with every living creature that is with you:  the birds,

        the livestock, and every animal of the earth with you,

        of all that go out of the ship, even every animal of the earth.

009:011 I will establish my covenant with you:  all flesh will not be cut

        off any more by the waters of the flood, neither will there

        ever again be a flood to destroy the earth."

009:012 God said, "This is the token of the covenant which I make

        between me and you and every living creature that is with you,

        for perpetual generations:

009:013 I set my rainbow in the cloud, and it will be for a sign

        of a covenant between me and the earth.

009:014 It will happen, when I bring a cloud over the earth,

        that the rainbow will be seen in the cloud,

009:015 and I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you

        and every living creature of all flesh, and the waters will

        no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.

009:016 The rainbow will be in the cloud.  I will look at it, that I

        may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every

        living creature of all flesh that is on the earth."

009:017 God said to Noah, "This is the token of the covenant which I

        have established between me and all flesh that is on the earth."

009:018 The sons of Noah who went forth from the ship were Shem, Ham,

        and Japheth.  Ham is the father of Canaan.

009:019 These three were the sons of Noah, and from these, the whole

        earth was populated.

009:020 Noah began to be a farmer, and planted a vineyard.

009:021 He drank of the wine and got drunk.  He was uncovered

        within his tent.

009:022 Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father,

        and told his two brothers outside.

009:023 Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it on both their shoulders,

        went in backwards, and covered the nakedness of their father.

        Their faces were backwards, and they didn't see

        their father's nakedness.

009:024 Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his youngest son had

        done to him.

009:025 He said, "Canaan is cursed.  He will be servant of servants

        to his brothers."

009:026 He said, "Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Shem.  Let Canaan

        be his servant.

009:027 May God enlarge Japheth.  Let him dwell in the tents of Shem.

        Let Canaan be his servant."

009:028 Noah lived three hundred fifty years after the flood.

009:029 All the days of Noah were nine hundred fifty years, then he died.

010:001 Now this is the history of the generations of the sons of Noah

        and of Shem, Ham, and Japheth.  Sons were born to them

        after the flood.

010:002 The sons of Japheth:  Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech,

        and Tiras.

010:003 The sons of Gomer:  Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah.

010:004 The sons of Javan:  Elishah, Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim.

010:005 Of these were the islands of the nations divided in their lands,

        everyone after his language, after their families,

        in their nations.

010:006 The sons of Ham:  Cush, Mizraim, Put, and Canaan.

010:007 The sons of Cush:  Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah, and Sabteca.

        The sons of Raamah:  Sheba and Dedan.

010:008 Cush became the father of Nimrod.  He began to be a mighty

        one in the earth.

010:009 He was a mighty hunter before Yahweh.  Therefore it is said,

        "Like Nimrod, a mighty hunter before Yahweh."

010:010 The beginning of his kingdom was Babel, Erech, Accad, and Calneh,

        in the land of Shinar.

010:011 Out of that land he went forth into Assyria, and built

        Nineveh, Rehoboth Ir, Calah,

010:012 and Resen between Nineveh and Calah (the same is the great city).

010:013 Mizraim became the father of Ludim, Anamim, Lehabim, Naphtuhim,

010:014 Pathrusim, Casluhim (which the Philistines descended from),

        and Caphtorim.

010:015 Canaan became the father of Sidon (his firstborn), Heth,

010:016 the Jebusite, the Amorite, the Girgashite,

010:017 the Hivite, the Arkite, the Sinite,

010:018 the Arvadite, the Zemarite, and the Hamathite.

        Afterward the families of the Canaanites were spread abroad.

010:019 The border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as you go

        toward Gerar, to Gaza; as you go toward Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah,

        and Zeboiim, to Lasha.

010:020 These are the sons of Ham, after their families,

        after their languages, in their lands, in their nations.

010:021 To Shem, the father of all the children of Eber, the elder

        brother of Japheth, to him also were children born.

010:022 The sons of Shem:  Elam, Asshur, Arpachshad, Lud, and Aram.

010:023 The sons of Aram:  Uz, Hul, Gether, and Mash.

010:024 Arpachshad became the father of Shelah.  Shelah became

        the father of Eber.

010:025 To Eber were born two sons.  The name of the one was Peleg,

        for in his days the earth was divided.  His brother's

        name was Joktan.

010:026 Joktan became the father of Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah,

010:027 Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah,

010:028 Obal, Abimael, Sheba,

010:029 Ophir, Havilah, and Jobab.  All these were the sons of Joktan.

010:030 Their dwelling was from Mesha, as you go toward Sephar,

        the mountain of the east.

010:031 These are the sons of Shem, after their families,

        after their languages, in their lands, after their nations.

010:032 These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations,

        in their nations.  Of these were the nations divided in the earth

        after the flood.

011:001 The whole earth was of one language and of one speech.

011:002 It happened, as they traveled east, that they found a plain

        in the land of Shinar, and they lived there.

011:003 They said one to another, "Come, let's make bricks, and burn

        them thoroughly."  They had brick for stone, and they used

        tar for mortar.

011:004 They said, "Come, let's build ourselves a city, and a tower

        whose top reaches to the sky, and let's make ourselves a name,

        lest we be scattered abroad on the surface of the whole earth."

011:005 Yahweh came down to see the city and the tower, which the children

        of men built.

011:006 Yahweh said, "Behold, they are one people, and they have

        all one language, and this is what they begin to do.

        Now nothing will be withheld from them, which they intend to do.

011:007 Come, let's go down, and there confuse their language,

        that they may not understand one another's speech."

011:008 So Yahweh scattered them abroad from there on the surface

        of all the earth.  They stopped building the city.

011:009 Therefore the name of it was called Babel, because there

        Yahweh confused the language of all the earth.  From there,

        Yahweh scattered them abroad on the surface of all the earth.

011:010 This is the history of the generations of Shem.  Shem was

        one hundred years old and became the father of Arpachshad

        two years after the flood.

011:011 Shem lived five hundred years after he became the father

        of Arpachshad, and became the father of sons and daughters.

011:012 Arpachshad lived thirty-five years and became the father of Shelah.

011:013 Arpachshad lived four hundred three years after he became the father

        of Shelah, and became the father of sons and daughters.

011:014 Shelah lived thirty years, and became the father of Eber:

011:015 and Shelah lived four hundred three years after he became

        the father of Eber, and became the father of sons and daughters.

011:016 Eber lived thirty-four years, and became the father of Peleg.

011:017 Eber lived four hundred thirty years after he became the father

        of Peleg, and became the father of sons and daughters.

011:018 Peleg lived thirty years, and became the father of Reu.

011:019 Peleg lived two hundred nine years after he became the father

        of Reu, and became the father of sons and daughters.

011:020 Reu lived thirty-two years, and became the father of Serug.

011:021 Reu lived two hundred seven years after he became the father

        of Serug, and became the father of sons and daughters.

011:022 Serug lived thirty years, and became the father of Nahor.

011:023 Serug lived two hundred years after he became the father of Nahor,

        and became the father of sons and daughters.

011:024 Nahor lived twenty-nine years, and became the father of Terah.

011:025 Nahor lived one hundred nineteen years after he became the father

        of Terah, and became the father of sons and daughters.

011:026 Terah lived seventy years, and became the father

        of Abram, Nahor, and Haran.

011:027 Now this is the history of the generations of Terah.

        Terah became the father of Abram, Nahor, and Haran.

        Haran became the father of Lot.

011:028 Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his birth,

        in Ur of the Chaldees.

011:029 Abram and Nahor took wives.  The name of Abram's wife was Sarai,

        and the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, the daughter of Haran

        who was also the father of Iscah.

011:030 Sarai was barren.  She had no child.

011:031 Terah took Abram his son, Lot the son of Haran, his son's son,

        and Sarai his daughter-in-law, his son Abram's wife.  They went

        forth from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan.

        They came to Haran and lived there.

011:032 The days of Terah were two hundred five years.

        Terah died in Haran.

012:001 Now Yahweh said to Abram, "Get out of your country,

        and from your relatives, and from your father's house,

        to the land that I will show you.

012:002 I will make of you a great nation.  I will bless you and make

        your name great.  You will be a blessing.

012:003 I will bless those who bless you, and I will curse him

        who curses you.  In you will all of the families of the

        earth be blessed."

012:004 So Abram went, as Yahweh had spoken to him.  Lot went with him.

        Abram was seventy-five years old when he departed out of Haran.

012:005 Abram took Sarai his wife, Lot his brother's son, all their substance

        that they had gathered, and the souls whom they had gotten

        in Haran, and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan.

        Into the land of Canaan they came.

012:006 Abram passed through the land to the place of Shechem,

        to the oak of Moreh.  The Canaanite was then in the land.

012:007 Yahweh appeared to Abram and said, "I will give this land to

        your seed{or, offspring}." He built an altar there to Yahweh,

        who appeared to him.

012:008 He left from there to the mountain on the east of Bethel,

        and pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and Ai

        on the east.  There he built an altar to Yahweh and called

        on the name of Yahweh.

012:009 Abram traveled, going on still toward the South.

012:010 There was a famine in the land.  Abram went down into Egypt

        to live as a foreigner there, for the famine was severe

        in the land.

012:011 It happened, when he had come near to enter Egypt, that he said

        to Sarai his wife, "See now, I know that you are a beautiful

        woman to look at.

012:012 It will happen, when the Egyptians will see you, that they

        will say, 'This is his wife.'  They will kill me, but they

        will save you alive.

012:013 Please say that you are my sister, that it may be well with me

        for your sake, and that my soul may live because of you."

012:014 It happened that when Abram had come into Egypt, the Egyptians

        saw that the woman was very beautiful.

012:015 The princes of Pharaoh saw her, and praised her to Pharaoh;

        and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.

012:016 He dealt well with Abram for her sake.  He had sheep,

        oxen, male donkeys, male servants, female servants,

        female donkeys, and camels.

012:017 Yahweh plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues

        because of Sarai, Abram's wife.

012:018 Pharaoh called Abram and said, "What is this that you have done

        to me?  Why didn't you tell me that she was your wife?

012:019 Why did you say, 'She is my sister,' so that I took her

        to be my wife?  Now therefore, see your wife, take her,

        and go your way."

012:020 Pharaoh gave men charge concerning him, and they brought him

        on the way with his wife and all that he had.

013:001 Abram went up out of Egypt:  he, his wife, all that he had,

        and Lot with him, into the South.

013:002 Abram was very rich in livestock, in silver, and in gold.

013:003 He went on his journeys from the South even to Bethel,

        to the place where his tent had been at the beginning,

        between Bethel and Ai,

013:004 to the place of the altar, which he had made there at the first.

        There Abram called on the name of Yahweh.

013:005 Lot also, who went with Abram, had flocks, and herds, and tents.

013:006 The land was not able to bear them, that they might live together:

        for their substance was great, so that they could not live together.

013:007 There was a strife between the herdsmen of Abram's livestock

        and the herdsmen of Lot's livestock:  and the Canaanite

        and the Perizzite lived in the land at that time.

013:008 Abram said to Lot, "Please, let there be no strife between

        me and you, and between my herdsmen and your herdsmen;

        for we are relatives.

013:009 Isn't the whole land before you?  Please separate yourself from me.

        If you go to the left hand, then I will go to the right.

        Or if you go to the right hand, then I will go to the left."

013:010 Lot lifted up his eyes, and saw all the plain of the Jordan,

        that it was well-watered everywhere, before Yahweh destroyed

        Sodom and Gomorrah, like the garden of Yahweh, like the land

        of Egypt, as you go to Zoar.

013:011 So Lot chose the Plain of the Jordan for himself.

        Lot traveled east, and they separated themselves the one

        from the other.

013:012 Abram lived in the land of Canaan, and Lot lived in the cities

        of the plain, and moved his tent as far as Sodom.

013:013 Now the men of Sodom were exceedingly wicked and sinners

        against Yahweh.

013:014 Yahweh said to Abram, after Lot was separated from him, "Now,

        lift up your eyes, and look from the place where you are,

        northward and southward and eastward and westward,

013:015 for all the land which you see, I will give to you, and to

        your offspring forever.

013:016 I will make your offspring as the dust of the earth, so that

        if a man can number the dust of the earth, then your seed

        may also be numbered.

013:017 Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth

        of it; for I will give it to you."

013:018 Abram moved his tent, and came and lived by the oaks of Mamre,

        which are in Hebron, and built an altar there to Yahweh.

014:001 It happened in the days of Amraphel, king of Shinar, Arioch,

        king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer, king of Elam, and Tidal,

        king of Goiim,

014:002 that they made war with Bera, king of Sodom, and with Birsha,

        king of Gomorrah, Shinab, king of Admah, and Shemeber,

        king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (the same is Zoar).

014:003 All these joined together in the valley of Siddim (the same

        is the Salt Sea).

014:004 Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth

        year, they rebelled.

014:005 In the fourteenth year Chedorlaomer came, and the kings who

        were with him, and struck the Rephaim in Ashteroth Karnaim,

        and the Zuzim in Ham, and the Emim in Shaveh Kiriathaim,

014:006 and the Horites in their Mount Seir, to Elparan, which is

        by the wilderness.

014:007 They returned, and came to En Mishpat (the same is Kadesh),

        and struck all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites,

        that lived in Hazazon Tamar.

014:008 The king of Sodom, and the king of Gomorrah, and the king

        of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela

        (the same is Zoar) went out; and they set the battle in array

        against them in the valley of Siddim;

014:009 against Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal king of Goiim,

        and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of Ellasar;

        four kings against the five.

014:010 Now the valley of Siddim was full of tar pits; and the kings

        of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and they fell there, and those

        who remained fled to the hills.

014:011 They took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all their food,

        and went their way.

014:012 They took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who lived in Sodom,

        and his goods, and departed.

014:013 One who had escaped came and told Abram, the Hebrew.

        Now he lived by the oaks of Mamre, the Amorite, brother of Eshcol,

        and brother of Aner; and these were allies of Abram.

014:014 When Abram heard that his relative was taken captive, he led forth

        his trained men, born in his house, three hundred and eighteen,

        and pursued as far as Dan.

014:015 He divided himself against them by night, he and his servants,

        and struck them, and pursued them to Hobah, which is on the left

        hand of Damascus.

014:016 He brought back all the goods, and also brought back

        his relative, Lot, and his goods, and the women also,

        and the people.

014:017 The king of Sodom went out to meet him, after his return from

        the slaughter of Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him,

        at the valley of Shaveh (that is, the King's Valley).

014:018 Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine:

        and he was priest of God Most High.

014:019 He blessed him, and said, "Blessed be Abram of God Most High,

        possessor of heaven and earth:

014:020 and blessed be God Most High, who has delivered your enemies

        into your hand."  Abram gave him a tenth of all.

014:021 The king of Sodom said to Abram, "Give me the people,

        and take the goods to yourself."

014:022 Abram said to the king of Sodom, "I have lifted up my hand

        to Yahweh, God Most High, possessor of heaven and earth,

014:023 that I will not take a thread nor a sandal strap nor anything

        that is yours, lest you should say, 'I have made Abram rich.'

014:024 I will accept nothing from you except that which the young men

        have eaten, and the portion of the men who went with me:

        Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre.  Let them take their portion."

015:001 After these things the word of Yahweh came to Abram in

        a vision, saying, "Don't be afraid, Abram.  I am your shield,

        your exceedingly great reward."

015:002 Abram said, "Lord Yahweh, what will you give me, seeing I

        go childless, and he who will inherit my estate is

        Eliezer of Damascus?"

015:003 Abram said, "Behold, to me you have given no seed:

        and, behold, one born in my house is my heir."

015:004 Behold, the word of Yahweh came to him, saying, "This man will

        not be your heir, but he who will come forth out of your own

        body will be your heir."

015:005 Yahweh brought him outside, and said, "Look now toward the sky,

        and count the stars, if you are able to count them."

        He said to Abram, "So shall your seed be."

015:006 He believed in Yahweh; and he reckoned it to him for righteousness.

015:007 He said to him, "I am Yahweh who brought you out of Ur

        of the Chaldees, to give you this land to inherit it."

015:008 He said, "Lord Yahweh, how will I know that I will inherit it?"

015:009 He said to him, "Bring me a heifer three years old, a female

        goat three years old, a ram three years old, a turtledove,

        and a young pigeon."

015:010 He brought him all of these, and divided them in the middle,

        and laid each half opposite the other; but he didn't

        divide the birds.

015:011 The birds of prey came down on the carcasses, and Abram

        drove them away.

015:012 When the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell on Abram.

        Now terror and great darkness fell on him.

015:013 He said to Abram, "Know for sure that your seed will live as

        foreigners in a land that is not theirs, and will serve them.

        They will afflict them four hundred years.

015:014 I will also judge that nation, whom they will serve.

        Afterward they will come out with great wealth,

015:015 but you will go to your fathers in peace.  You will be buried

        in a good old age.

015:016 In the fourth generation they will come here again,

        for the iniquity of the Amorite is not yet full."

015:017 It came to pass that, when the sun went down, and it

        was dark, behold, a smoking furnace, and a flaming torch

        passed between these pieces.

015:018 In that day Yahweh made a covenant with Abram, saying, "To your

        seed I have given this land, from the river of Egypt to

        the great river, the river Euphrates:

015:019 the Kenites, the Kenizzites, the Kadmonites,

015:020 the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Rephaim,

015:021 the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Girgashites, and the Jebusites."

016:001 Now Sarai, Abram's wife, bore him no children.  She had a handmaid,

        an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar.

016:002 Sarai said to Abram, "See now, Yahweh has restrained me from bearing.

        Please go in to my handmaid.  It may be that I will obtain

        children by her."  Abram listened to the voice of Sarai.

016:003 Sarai, Abram's wife, took Hagar the Egyptian, her handmaid,

        after Abram had lived ten years in the land of Canaan,

        and gave her to Abram her husband to be his wife.

016:004 He went in to Hagar, and she conceived.  When she saw that she

        had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.

016:005 Sarai said to Abram, "This wrong is your fault.

        I gave my handmaid into your bosom, and when she saw

        that she had conceived, I was despised in her eyes.

        Yahweh judge between me and you."

016:006 But Abram said to Sarai, "Behold, your maid is in your hand.

        Do to her whatever is good in your eyes."  Sarai dealt harshly

        with her, and she fled from her face.

016:007 The angel of Yahweh found her by a fountain of water in

        the wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur.

016:008 He said, "Hagar, Sarai's handmaid, where did you come from?

        Where are you going?"  She said, "I am fleeing from the face

        of my mistress Sarai."

016:009 The angel of Yahweh said to her, "Return to your mistress,

        and submit yourself under her hands."

016:010 The angel of Yahweh said to her, "I will greatly multiply

        your seed, that they will not be numbered for multitude."

016:011 The angel of Yahweh said to her, "Behold, you are with child,

        and will bear a son.  You shall call his name Ishmael,

        because Yahweh has heard your affliction.

016:012 He will be like a wild donkey among men.  His hand will

        be against every man, and every man's hand against him.

        He will live opposite all of his brothers."

016:013 She called the name of Yahweh who spoke to her, "You are

        a God who sees," for she said, "Have I even stayed alive

        after seeing him?"

016:014 Therefore the well was called Beer Lahai Roi.{Beer Lahai Roi

        means "well of the one who lives and sees me."} Behold,

        it is between Kadesh and Bered.

016:015 Hagar bore a son for Abram.  Abram called the name of his son,

        whom Hagar bore, Ishmael.

016:016 Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar bore Ishmael to Abram.

017:001 When Abram was ninety-nine years old, Yahweh appeared to Abram,

        and said to him, "I am God Almighty.  Walk before me,

        and be blameless.

017:002 I will make my covenant between me and you, and will

        multiply you exceedingly."

017:003 Abram fell on his face.  God talked with him, saying,

017:004 "As for me, behold, my covenant is with you.  You will be

        the father of a multitude of nations.

017:005 Neither will your name any more be called Abram, but your

        name will be Abraham; for I have made you the father of a

        multitude of nations.

017:006 I will make you exceedingly fruitful, and I will make nations of you.

        Kings will come out of you.

017:007 I will establish my covenant between me and you and your seed

        after you throughout their generations for an everlasting covenant,

        to be a God to you and to your seed after you.

017:008 I will give to you, and to your seed after you, the land

        where you are traveling, all the land of Canaan, for an

        everlasting possession.  I will be their God."

017:009 God said to Abraham, "As for you, you will keep my covenant,

        you and your seed after you throughout their generations.

017:010 This is my covenant, which you shall keep, between me

        and you and your seed after you.  Every male among you

        shall be circumcised.

017:011 You shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskin.

        It will be a token of the covenant between me and you.

017:012 He who is eight days old will be circumcised among you,

        every male throughout your generations, he who is born

        in the house, or bought with money from any foreigner who is

        not of your seed.

017:013 He who is born in your house, and he who is bought with your money,

        must be circumcised.  My covenant will be in your flesh

        for an everlasting covenant.

017:014 The uncircumcised male who is not circumcised in the flesh

        of his foreskin, that soul shall be cut off from his people.

        He has broken my covenant."

017:015 God said to Abraham, "As for Sarai your wife, you shall not

        call her name Sarai, but her name will be Sarah.

017:016 I will bless her, and moreover I will give you a son by her.

        Yes, I will bless her, and she will be a mother of nations.

        Kings of peoples will come from her."

017:017 Then Abraham fell on his face, and laughed, and said in his heart,

        "Will a child be born to him who is one hundred years old?

        Will Sarah, who is ninety years old, give birth?"

017:018 Abraham said to God, "Oh that Ishmael might live before you!"

017:019 God said, "No, but Sarah, your wife, will bear you a son.

        You shall call his name Isaac.{Isaac means "he laughs."} I

        will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant

        for his seed after him.

017:020 As for Ishmael, I have heard you.  Behold, I have blessed him,

        and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him exceedingly.

        He will become the father of twelve princes, and I will make

        him a great nation.

017:021 But my covenant I establish with Isaac, whom Sarah will bear

        to you at this set time next year."

017:022 When he finished talking with him, God went up from Abraham.

017:023 Abraham took Ishmael his son, all who were born in his house,

        and all who were bought with his money; every male among

        the men of Abraham's house, and circumcised the flesh of their

        foreskin in the same day, as God had said to him.

017:024 Abraham was ninety-nine years old, when he was circumcised

        in the flesh of his foreskin.

017:025 Ishmael, his son, was thirteen years old when he was circumcised

        in the flesh of his foreskin.

017:026 In the same day both Abraham and Ishmael, his son, were circumcised.

017:027 All the men of his house, those born in the house, and those

        bought with money of a foreigner, were circumcised with him.

018:001 Yahweh appeared to him by the oaks of Mamre, as he sat

        in the tent door in the heat of the day.

018:002 He lifted up his eyes and looked, and saw that three men

        stood opposite him.  When he saw them, he ran to meet them

        from the tent door, and bowed himself to the earth,

018:003 and said, "My lord, if now I have found favor in your sight,

        please don't go away from your servant.

018:004 Now let a little water be fetched, wash your feet, and rest

        yourselves under the tree.

018:005 I will get a morsel of bread so you can refresh your heart.

        After that you may go your way, now that you have come to

        your servant."  They said, "Very well, do as you have said."

018:006 Abraham hurried into the tent to Sarah, and said, "Quickly make

        ready three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make cakes."

018:007 Abraham ran to the herd, and fetched a tender and good calf,

        and gave it to the servant.  He hurried to dress it.

018:008 He took butter, milk, and the calf which he had dressed,

        and set it before them.  He stood by them under the tree,

        and they ate.

018:009 They said to him, "Where is Sarah, your wife?

        He said, "See, in the tent."

018:010 He said, "I will certainly return to you when the season

        comes round.  Behold, Sarah your wife will have a son."

        Sarah heard in the tent door, which was behind him.

018:011 Now Abraham and Sarah were old, well advanced in age.

        It had ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.

018:012 Sarah laughed within herself, saying, "After I have grown old

        will I have pleasure, my lord being old also?"

018:013 Yahweh said to Abraham, "Why did Sarah laugh, saying, 'Will I

        really bear a child, yet I am old?'

018:014 Is anything too hard for Yahweh?  At the set time I will return

        to you, when the season comes round, and Sarah will have a son."

018:015 Then Sarah denied, saying, "I didn't laugh," for she was afraid.

        He said, "No, but you did laugh."

018:016 The men rose up from there, and looked toward Sodom.

        Abraham went with them to see them on their way.

018:017 Yahweh said, "Will I hide from Abraham what I do,

018:018 seeing that Abraham has surely become a great and mighty nation,

        and all the nations of the earth will be blessed in him?

018:019 For I have known him, to the end that he may command his

        children and his household after him, that they may keep

        the way of Yahweh, to do righteousness and justice;

        to the end that Yahweh may bring on Abraham that which he has

        spoken of him."

018:020 Yahweh said, "Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great,

        and because their sin is very grievous,

018:021 I will go down now, and see whether their deeds are as bad

        as the reports which have come to me.  If not, I will know."

018:022 The men turned from there, and went toward Sodom, but Abraham

        stood yet before Yahweh.

018:023 Abraham drew near, and said, "Will you consume the righteous

        with the wicked?

018:024 What if there are fifty righteous within the city?

        Will you consume and not spare the place for the fifty

        righteous who are in it?

018:025 Be it far from you to do things like that, to kill the righteous

        with the wicked, so that the righteous should be like the wicked.

        May that be far from you.  Shouldn't the Judge of all

        the earth do right?"

018:026 Yahweh said, "If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city,

        then I will spare all the place for their sake."

018:027 Abraham answered, "See now, I have taken it on myself to speak

        to the Lord, who am but dust and ashes.

018:028 What if there will lack five of the fifty righteous?

        Will you destroy all the city for lack of five?"  He said,

        "I will not destroy it, if I find forty-five there."

018:029 He spoke to him yet again, and said, "What if there are forty

        found there?"  He said, "I will not do it for the forty's sake."

018:030 He said, "Oh don't let the Lord be angry, and I will speak.

        What if there are thirty found there?"  He said, "I will not

        do it, if I find thirty there."

018:031 He said, "See now, I have taken it on myself to speak to the Lord.

        What if there are twenty found there?"  He said, "I will not

        destroy it for the twenty's sake."

018:032 He said, "Oh don't let the Lord be angry, and I will

        speak just once more.  What if ten are found there?"

        He said, "I will not destroy it for the ten's sake."

018:033 Yahweh went his way, as soon as he had finished communing

        with Abraham, and Abraham returned to his place.

019:001 The two angels came to Sodom at evening.  Lot sat in the gate

        of Sodom.  Lot saw them, and rose up to meet them.

        He bowed himself with his face to the earth,

019:002 and he said, "See now, my lords, please turn aside into

        your servant's house, stay all night, wash your feet,

        and you will rise up early, and go on your way."

        They said, "No, but we will stay in the street all night."

019:003 He urged them greatly, and they came in with him, and entered

        into his house.  He made them a feast, and baked unleavened bread,

        and they ate.

019:004 But before they lay down, the men of the city, the men of Sodom,

        surrounded the house, both young and old, all the people

        from every quarter.

019:005 They called to Lot, and said to him, "Where are the men

        who came in to you this night?  Bring them out to us,

        that we may have sex with them."

019:006 Lot went out to them to the door, and shut the door after him.

019:007 He said, "Please, my brothers, don't act so wickedly.

019:008 See now, I have two virgin daughters.  Please let me bring them

        out to you, and you may do to them what seems good to you.

        Only don't do anything to these men, because they have come

        under the shadow of my roof."

019:009 They said, "Stand back!"  They said, "This one fellow came

        in to live as a foreigner, and he appoints himself a judge.

        Now will we deal worse with you, than with them!"

        They pressed hard on the man Lot, and drew near to break the door.

019:010 But the men put forth their hand, and brought Lot into the house

        to them, and shut the door.

019:011 They struck the men who were at the door of the house

        with blindness, both small and great, so that they wearied

        themselves to find the door.

019:012 The men said to Lot, "Do you have anybody else here?

        Sons-in-law, your sons, your daughters, and whoever you

        have in the city, bring them out of the place:

019:013 for we will destroy this place, because the outcry against

        them has grown great before Yahweh that Yahweh has sent us

        to destroy it."

019:014 Lot went out, and spoke to his sons-in-law, who were

        pledged to marry his daughters, and said, "Get up!

        Get out of this place, for Yahweh will destroy the city."

        But he seemed to his sons-in-law to be joking.

019:015 When the morning came, then the angels hurried Lot, saying, "Get up!

        Take your wife, and your two daughters who are here,

        lest you be consumed in the iniquity of the city."

019:016 But he lingered; and the men grabbed his hand, his wife's hand,

        and his two daughters' hands, Yahweh being merciful to him;

        and they took him out, and set him outside of the city.

019:017 It came to pass, when they had taken them out, that he said,

        "Escape for your life!  Don't look behind you, and don't

        stay anywhere in the plain.  Escape to the mountains,

        lest you be consumed!"

019:018 Lot said to them, "Oh, not so, my lord.

019:019 See now, your servant has found favor in your sight, and you

        have magnified your loving kindness, which you have shown

        to me in saving my life.  I can't escape to the mountain,

        lest evil overtake me, and I die.

019:020 See now, this city is near to flee to, and it is a little one.

        Oh let me escape there (isn't it a little one?), and my

        soul will live."

019:021 He said to him, "Behold, I have granted your request concerning

        this thing also, that I will not overthrow the city of which

        you have spoken.

019:022 Hurry, escape there, for I can't do anything until you get there."

        Therefore the name of the city was called Zoar.{Zoar means "little."}

019:023 The sun had risen on the earth when Lot came to Zoar.

019:024 Then Yahweh rained on Sodom and on Gomorrah sulfur and fire

        from Yahweh out of the sky.

019:025 He overthrew those cities, all the plain, all the inhabitants

        of the cities, and that which grew on the ground.

019:026 But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became

        a pillar of salt.

019:027 Abraham got up early in the morning to the place where he had

        stood before Yahweh.

019:028 He looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land

        of the plain, and looked, and saw that the smoke of the land

        went up as the smoke of a furnace.

019:029 It happened, when God destroyed the cities of the plain,

        that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the middle

        of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in which Lot lived.

019:030 Lot went up out of Zoar, and lived in the mountain, and his

        two daughters with him; for he was afraid to live in Zoar.

        He lived in a cave with his two daughters.

019:031 The firstborn said to the younger, "Our father is old,

        and there is not a man in the earth to come in to us after

        the manner of all the earth.

019:032 Come, let's make our father drink wine, and we will lie with him,

        that we may preserve our father's seed."

019:033 They made their father drink wine that night:

        and the firstborn went in, and lay with her father.

        He didn't know when she lay down, nor when she arose.

019:034 It came to pass on the next day, that the firstborn said

        to the younger, "Behold, I lay last night with my father.

        Let us make him drink wine again, tonight.  You go in,

        and lie with him, that we may preserve our father's seed."

019:035 They made their father drink wine that night also.

        The younger went and lay with him.  He didn't know when she

        lay down, nor when she got up.

019:036 Thus both of Lot's daughters were with child by their father.

019:037 The firstborn bore a son, and named him Moab.  He is the father

        of the Moabites to this day.

019:038 The younger also bore a son, and called his name Ben Ammi.

        He is the father of the children of Ammon to this day.

020:001 Abraham traveled from there toward the land of the South, and lived

        between Kadesh and Shur.  He lived as a foreigner in Gerar.

020:002 Abraham said about Sarah his wife, "She is my sister."

        Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah.

020:003 But God came to Abimelech in a dream of the night, and said

        to him, "Behold, you are a dead man, because of the woman

        whom you have taken.  For she is a man's wife."

020:004 Now Abimelech had not come near her.  He said, "Lord, will you

        kill even a righteous nation?

020:005 Didn't he tell me, 'She is my sister?'  She, even she herself,

        said, 'He is my brother.'  In the integrity of my heart

        and the innocence of my hands have I done this."

020:006 God said to him in the dream, "Yes, I know that in the integrity

        of your heart you have done this, and I also withheld you

        from sinning against me.  Therefore I didn't allow you

        to touch her.

020:007 Now therefore, restore the man's wife.  For he is a prophet,

        and he will pray for you, and you will live.  If you don't

        restore her, know for sure that you will die, you, and all

        who are yours."

020:008 Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all

        his servants, and told all these things in their ear.

        The men were very scared.

020:009 Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said to him,

        "What have you done to us?  How have I sinned against you,

        that you have brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin?

        You have done deeds to me that ought not to be done!"

020:010 Abimelech said to Abraham, "What did you see, that you have

        done this thing?"

020:011 Abraham said, "Because I thought, 'Surely the fear of God is

        not in this place.  They will kill me for my wife's sake.'

020:012 Besides, she is indeed my sister, the daughter of my father,

        but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my wife.

020:013 It happened, when God caused me to wander from my father's house,

        that I said to her, 'This is your kindness which you shall show

        to me.  Everywhere that we go, say of me, "He is my brother."'"

020:014 Abimelech took sheep and oxen, male servants and female servants,

        and gave them to Abraham, and restored Sarah, his wife, to him.

020:015 Abimelech said, "Behold, my land is before you.

        Dwell where it pleases you."

020:016 To Sarah he said, "Behold, I have given your brother a thousand

        pieces of silver.  Behold, it is for you a covering of the eyes

        to all that are with you.  In front of all you are vindicated."

020:017 Abraham prayed to God.  God healed Abimelech, and his wife,

        and his female servants, and they bore children.

020:018 For Yahweh had closed up tight all the wombs of the house

        of Abimelech, because of Sarah, Abraham's wife.

021:001 Yahweh visited Sarah as he had said, and Yahweh did to Sarah

        as he had spoken.

021:002 Sarah conceived, and bore Abraham a son in his old age,

        at the set time of which God had spoken to him.

021:003 Abraham called his son who was born to him, whom Sarah bore

        to him, Isaac.{Isaac means "He laughs."}

021:004 Abraham circumcised his son, Isaac, when he was eight days old,

        as God had commanded him.

021:005 Abraham was one hundred years old when his son, Isaac,

        was born to him.

021:006 Sarah said, "God has made me laugh.  Everyone who hears will

        laugh with me."

021:007 She said, "Who would have said to Abraham, that Sarah would

        nurse children?  For I have borne him a son in his old age."

021:008 The child grew, and was weaned.  Abraham made a great feast

        on the day that Isaac was weaned.

021:009 Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne

        to Abraham, mocking.

021:010 Therefore she said to Abraham, "Cast out this handmaid and her son!

        For the son of this handmaid will not be heir with my son, Isaac."

021:011 The thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight on account

        of his son.

021:012 God said to Abraham, "Don't let it be grievous in your

        sight because of the boy, and because of your handmaid.

        In all that Sarah says to you, listen to her voice.

        For from Isaac will your seed be called.

021:013 I will also make a nation of the son of the handmaid,

        because he is your seed."

021:014 Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread and a bottle

        of water, and gave it to Hagar, putting it on her shoulder;

        and gave her the child, and sent her away.  She departed,

        and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba.

021:015 The water in the bottle was spent, and she cast the child

        under one of the shrubs.

021:016 She went and sat down opposite him, a good way off, about a bow

        shot away.  For she said, "Don't let me see the death of the child."

        She sat over against him, and lifted up her voice, and wept.

021:017 God heard the voice of the boy.  The angel of God called

        to Hagar out of the sky, and said to her, "What ails

        you, Hagar?  Don't be afraid.  For God has heard the voice

        of the boy where he is.

021:018 Get up, lift up the boy, and hold him in your hand.

        For I will make him a great nation."

021:019 God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water.  She went,

        filled the bottle with water, and gave the boy drink.

021:020 God was with the boy, and he grew.  He lived in the wilderness,

        and became, as he grew up, an archer.

021:021 He lived in the wilderness of Paran.  His mother took a wife

        for him out of the land of Egypt.

021:022 It happened at that time, that Abimelech and Phicol the captain

        of his army spoke to Abraham, saying, "God is with you in all

        that you do.

021:023 Now, therefore, swear to me here by God that you will not deal

        falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son's son.

        But according to the kindness that I have done to you,

        you shall do to me, and to the land in which you have lived

        as a foreigner."

021:024 Abraham said, "I will swear."

021:025 Abraham complained to Abimelech because of a water well,

        which Abimelech's servants had violently taken away.

021:026 Abimelech said, "I don't know who has done this thing.

        Neither did you tell me, neither did I hear of it, until today."

021:027 Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them to Abimelech.

        Those two made a covenant.

021:028 Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.

021:029 Abimelech said to Abraham, "What do these seven ewe lambs

        which you have set by themselves mean?"

021:030 He said, "You shall take these seven ewe lambs from my hand,

        that it may be a witness to me, that I have dug this well."

021:031 Therefore he called that place Beersheba,{Beersheba can

        mean "well of the oath" or "well of seven."} because they

        both swore there.

021:032 So they made a covenant at Beersheba.  Abimelech rose up

        with Phicol, the captain of his army, and they returned

        into the land of the Philistines.

021:033 Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beersheba, and called there

        on the name of Yahweh, the Everlasting God.

021:034 Abraham lived as a foreigner in the land of the Philistines

        many days.

022:001 It happened after these things, that God tested Abraham,

        and said to him, "Abraham!"  He said, "Here I am."

022:002 He said, "Now take your son, your only son, whom you love,

        even Isaac, and go into the land of Moriah.  Offer him there

        for a burnt offering on one of the mountains which I will

        tell you of."

022:003 Abraham rose early in the morning, and saddled his donkey,

        and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son.

        He split the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up,

        and went to the place of which God had told him.

022:004 On the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw

        the place far off.

022:005 Abraham said to his young men, "Stay here with the donkey.

        The boy and I will go yonder.  We will worship, and come

        back to you."

022:006 Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it on

        Isaac his son.  He took in his hand the fire and the knife.

        They both went together.

022:007 Isaac spoke to Abraham his father, and said, "My father?"

        He said, "Here I am, my son."  He said, "Here is the fire

        and the wood, but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?"

022:008 Abraham said, "God will provide himself the lamb for a burnt offering,

        my son."  So they both went together.

022:009 They came to the place which God had told him of.

        Abraham built the altar there, and laid the wood in order,

        bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar, on the wood.

022:010 Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to

        kill his son.

022:011 The angel of Yahweh called to him out of the sky, and said,

        "Abraham, Abraham!"  He said, "Here I am."

022:012 He said, "Don't lay your hand on the boy, neither do anything to him.

        For now I know that you fear God, seeing you have not withheld

        your son, your only son, from me."

022:013 Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and saw that behind

        him was a ram caught in the thicket by his horns.

        Abraham went and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt

        offering instead of his son.

022:014 Abraham called the name of that place Yahweh Will Provide{or,

        Yahweh-Jireh, or, Yahweh-Seeing}. As it is said to this day,

        "On Yahweh's mountain, it will be provided."

022:015 The angel of Yahweh called to Abraham a second time out

        of the sky,

022:016 and said, "I have sworn by myself, says Yahweh, because you

        have done this thing, and have not withheld your son,

        your only son,

022:017 that I will bless you greatly, and I will multiply your seed

        greatly like the stars of the heavens, and like the sand

        which is on the seashore.  Your seed will possess the gate

        of his enemies.

022:018 In your seed will all the nations of the earth be blessed,

        because you have obeyed my voice."

022:019 So Abraham returned to his young men, and they rose up and went

        together to Beersheba.  Abraham lived at Beersheba.

022:020 It happened after these things, that it was told Abraham,

        saying, "Behold, Milcah, she also has borne children to

        your brother Nahor:

022:021 Uz his firstborn, Buz his brother, Kemuel the father of Aram,

022:022 Chesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, and Bethuel."

022:023 Bethuel became the father of Rebekah.  These eight Milcah bore

        to Nahor, Abraham's brother.

022:024 His concubine, whose name was Reumah, also bore

        Tebah, Gaham, Tahash, and Maacah.

023:001 Sarah lived one hundred twenty-seven years.  This was the length

        of Sarah's life.

023:002 Sarah died in Kiriath Arba (the same is Hebron), in the land

        of Canaan.  Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her.

023:003 Abraham rose up from before his dead, and spoke to the children

        of Heth, saying,

023:004 "I am a stranger and a foreigner living with you.

        Give me a possession of a burying-place with you, that I

        may bury my dead out of my sight."

023:005 The children of Heth answered Abraham, saying to him,

023:006 "Hear us, my lord.  You are a prince of God among us.

        Bury your dead in the best of our tombs.  None of us will

        withhold from you his tomb.  Bury your dead."

023:007 Abraham rose up, and bowed himself to the people of the land,

        even to the children of Heth.

023:008 He talked with them, saying, "If it be your mind that I should

        bury my dead out of my sight, hear me, and entreat for me

        to Ephron the son of Zohar,

023:009 that he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he has,

        which is in the end of his field.  For the full price let him

        give it to me among you for a possession of a burying-place."

023:010 Now Ephron was sitting in the middle of the children of Heth.

        Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the hearing of

        the children of Heth, even of all who went in at the gate

        of his city, saying,

023:011 "No, my lord, hear me.  I give you the field, and I give you

        the cave that is in it.  In the presence of the children

        of my people I give it to you.  Bury your dead."

023:012 Abraham bowed himself down before the people of the land.

023:013 He spoke to Ephron in the audience of the people of

        the land, saying, "But if you will, please hear me.

        I will give the price of the field.  Take it from me,

        and I will bury my dead there."

023:014 Ephron answered Abraham, saying to him,

023:015 "My lord, listen to me.  What is a piece of land worth

        four hundred shekels of silver between me and you?

        Therefore bury your dead."

023:016 Abraham listened to Ephron.  Abraham weighed to Ephron

        the silver which he had named in the audience of the children

        of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, according to the

        current merchants' standard.

023:017 So the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was

        before Mamre, the field, the cave which was in it,

        and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all

        of its borders, were deeded

023:018 to Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children

        of Heth, before all who went in at the gate of his city.

023:019 After this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave

        of the field of Machpelah before Mamre (that is, Hebron),

        in the land of Canaan.

023:020 The field, and the cave that is in it, were deeded to Abraham

        for a possession of a burying place by the children of Heth.

024:001 Abraham was old, and well stricken in age.  Yahweh had blessed

        Abraham in all things.

024:002 Abraham said to his servant, the elder of his house, who ruled

        over all that he had, "Please put your hand under my thigh.

024:003 I will make you swear by Yahweh, the God of heaven and the God

        of the earth, that you shall not take a wife for my son

        of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I live.

024:004 But you shall go to my country, and to my relatives, and take

        a wife for my son Isaac."

024:005 The servant said to him, "What if the woman isn't willing

        to follow me to this land?  Must I bring your son again

        to the land you came from?"

024:006 Abraham said to him, "Beware that you don't bring my

        son there again.

024:007 Yahweh, the God of heaven, who took me from my father's house,

        and from the land of my birth, who spoke to me, and who swore

        to me, saying, 'I will give this land to your seed{or, offspring}.'

        He will send his angel before you, and you shall take a wife

        for my son from there.

024:008 If the woman isn't willing to follow you, then you shall

        be clear from this my oath.  Only you shall not bring my

        son there again."

024:009 The servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master,

        and swore to him concerning this matter.

024:010 The servant took ten camels, of his master's camels, and departed,

        having a variety of good things of his master's with him.

        He arose, and went to Mesopotamia, to the city of Nahor.

024:011 He made the camels kneel down outside the city by the well

        of water at the time of evening, the time that women go out

        to draw water.

024:012 He said, "Yahweh, the God of my master Abraham, please give me

        success this day, and show kindness to my master Abraham.

024:013 Behold, I am standing by the spring of water.  The daughters

        of the men of the city are coming out to draw water.

024:014 Let it happen, that the young lady to whom I will say,

        'Please let down your pitcher, that I may drink,' and she

        will say, 'Drink, and I will also give your camels a drink,'--

        let her be the one you have appointed for your servant Isaac.

        By this I will know that you have shown kindness to my master."

024:015 It happened, before he had finished speaking, that behold,

        Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel the son of Milcah,

        the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother, with her pitcher

        on her shoulder.

024:016 The young lady was very beautiful to look at, a virgin,

        neither had any man known her.  She went down to the spring,

        filled her pitcher, and came up.

024:017 The servant ran to meet her, and said, "Please give me a drink,

        a little water from your pitcher."

024:018 She said, "Drink, my lord."  She hurried, and let down her

        pitcher on her hand, and gave him drink.

024:019 When she had done giving him drink, she said, "I will also draw

        for your camels, until they have done drinking."

024:020 She hurried, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran

        again to the well to draw, and drew for all his camels.

024:021 The man looked steadfastly at her, remaining silent, to know

        whether Yahweh had made his journey prosperous or not.

024:022 It happened, as the camels had done drinking, that the man

        took a golden ring of half a shekel weight, and two bracelets

        for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold,

024:023 and said, "Whose daughter are you?  Please tell me.

        Is there room in your father's house for us to lodge in?"

024:024 She said to him, "I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah,

        whom she bore to Nahor."

024:025 She said moreover to him, "We have both straw and provender enough,

        and room to lodge in."

024:026 The man bowed his head, and worshiped Yahweh.

024:027 He said, "Blessed be Yahweh, the God of my master Abraham, who has

        not forsaken his loving kindness and his truth toward my master.

        As for me, Yahweh has led me in the way to the house of

        my master's relatives."

024:028 The young lady ran, and told her mother's house about these words.

024:029 Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban.  Laban ran

        out to the man, to the spring.

024:030 It happened, when he saw the ring, and the bracelets on his

        sister's hands, and when he heard the words of Rebekah

        his sister, saying, "This is what the man said to me,"

        that he came to the man.  Behold, he was standing by the camels

        at the spring.

024:031 He said, "Come in, you blessed of Yahweh.  Why do you stand outside?

        For I have prepared the house, and room for the camels."

024:032 The man came into the house, and he unloaded the camels.

        He gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash

        his feet and the feet of the men who were with him.

024:033 Food was set before him to eat, but he said, "I will not eat

        until I have told my message."  He said, "Speak on."

024:034 He said, "I am Abraham's servant.

024:035 Yahweh has blessed my master greatly.  He has become great.

        He has given him flocks and herds, silver and gold,

        male servants and female servants, and camels and donkeys.

024:036 Sarah, my master's wife, bore a son to my master when she was old.

        He has given all that he has to him.

024:037 My master made me swear, saying, 'You shall not take a wife

        for my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose

        land I live,

024:038 but you shall go to my father's house, and to my relatives,

        and take a wife for my son.'

024:039 I said to my master, 'What if the woman will not follow me?'

024:040 He said to me, 'Yahweh, before whom I walk, will send his

        angel with you, and prosper your way.  You shall take a wife

        for my son of my relatives, and of my father's house.

024:041 Then will you be clear from my oath, when you come to my relatives.

        If they don't give her to you, you shall be clear from my oath.'

024:042 I came this day to the spring, and said, 'Yahweh, the God

        of my master Abraham, if now you do prosper my way which I go--

024:043 behold, I am standing by this spring of water.  Let it happen,

        that the maiden who comes forth to draw, to whom I will say,

        "Give me, I pray you, a little water from your pitcher to drink,"

024:044 and she will tell me, "Drink, and I will also draw for

        your camels,"--let her be the woman whom Yahweh has appointed

        for my master's son.'

024:045 Before I had done speaking in my heart, behold, Rebekah came forth

        with her pitcher on her shoulder.  She went down to the spring,

        and drew.  I said to her, 'Please let me drink.'

024:046 She hurried and let down her pitcher from her shoulder,

        and said, 'Drink, and I will also give your camels a drink.'

        So I drank, and she made the camels drink also.

024:047 I asked her, and said, 'Whose daughter are you?'  She said,

        'The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bore to him.'

        I put the ring on her nose, and the bracelets on her hands.

024:048 I bowed my head, and worshiped Yahweh, and blessed Yahweh,

        the God of my master Abraham, who had led me in the right way

        to take my master's brother's daughter for his son.

024:049 Now if you will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell me.

        If not, tell me, that I may turn to the right hand,

        or to the left."

024:050 Then Laban and Bethuel answered, "The thing proceeds from Yahweh.

        We can't speak to you bad or good.

024:051 Behold, Rebekah is before you.  Take her, and go, and let

        her be your master's son's wife, as Yahweh has spoken."

024:052 It happened that when Abraham's servant heard their words,

        he bowed himself down to the earth to Yahweh.

024:053 The servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of gold,

        and clothing, and gave them to Rebekah.  He also gave precious

        things to her brother and her mother.

024:054 They ate and drank, he and the men who were with him,

        and stayed all night.  They rose up in the morning, and he said,

        "Send me away to my master."

024:055 Her brother and her mother said, "Let the young lady stay

        with us a few days, at least ten.  After that she will go."

024:056 He said to them, "Don't hinder me, seeing Yahweh has prospered

        my way.  Send me away that I may go to my master."

024:057 They said, "We will call the young lady, and ask her."

024:058 They called Rebekah, and said to her, "Will you go with this man?"

        She said, "I will go."

024:059 They sent away Rebekah, their sister, with her nurse,

        Abraham's servant, and his men.

024:060 They blessed Rebekah, and said to her, "Our sister, may you

        be the mother of thousands of ten thousands, and let your seed

        possess the gate of those who hate them."

024:061 Rebekah arose with her ladies.  They rode on the camels,

        and followed the man.  The servant took Rebekah, and went his way.

024:062 Isaac came from the way of Beer Lahai Roi, for he lived

        in the land of the South.

024:063 Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the evening.

        He lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, there

        were camels coming.

024:064 Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac,

        she dismounted from the camel.

024:065 She said to the servant, "Who is the man who is walking in

        the field to meet us?"  The servant said, "It is my master."

        She took her veil, and covered herself.

024:066 The servant told Isaac all the things that he had done.

024:067 Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent,

        and took Rebekah, and she became his wife.  He loved her.

        Isaac was comforted after his mother's death.

025:001 Abraham took another wife, and her name was Keturah.

025:002 She bore him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah.

025:003 Jokshan became the father of Sheba, and Dedan.  The sons

        of Dedan were Asshurim, Letushim, and Leummim.

025:004 The sons of Midian:  Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida, and Eldaah.

        All these were the children of Keturah.

025:005 Abraham gave all that he had to Isaac,

025:006 but to the sons of Abraham's concubines, Abraham gave gifts.

        He sent them away from Isaac his son, while he yet lived,

        eastward, to the east country.

025:007 These are the days of the years of Abraham's life which he lived:

        one hundred seventy-five years.

025:008 Abraham gave up the spirit, and died in a good old age,

        an old man, and full of years, and was gathered to his people.

025:009 Isaac and Ishmael, his sons, buried him in the cave of Machpelah,

        in the field of Ephron, the son of Zohar the Hittite,

        which is before Mamre,

025:010 the field which Abraham purchased of the children of Heth.

        Abraham was buried there with Sarah, his wife.

025:011 It happened after the death of Abraham that God blessed Isaac,

        his son.  Isaac lived by Beer Lahai Roi.

025:012 Now this is the history of the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son,

        whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bore to Abraham.

025:013 These are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their names,

        according to the order of their birth:  the firstborn

        of Ishmael, Nebaioth, then Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam,

025:014 Mishma, Dumah, Massa,

025:015 Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah.

025:016 These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names,

        by their villages, and by their encampments:  twelve princes,

        according to their nations.

025:017 These are the years of the life of Ishmael:  one hundred

        thirty-seven years.  He gave up the spirit and died,

        and was gathered to his people.

025:018 They lived from Havilah to Shur that is before Egypt, as you

        go toward Assyria.  He lived opposite all his relatives.

025:019 This is the history of the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son.

        Abraham became the father of Isaac.

025:020 Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah, the daughter

        of Bethuel the Syrian of Paddan Aram, the sister of Laban

        the Syrian, to be his wife.

025:021 Isaac entreated Yahweh for his wife, because she was barren.

        Yahweh was entreated by him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.

025:022 The children struggled together within her.  She said,

        "If it be so, why do I live?"  She went to inquire of Yahweh.

025:023 Yahweh said to her, Two nations are in your womb.

        Two peoples will be separated from your body.

        The one people will be stronger than the other people.

        The elder will serve the younger.

025:024 When her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were

        twins in her womb.

025:025 The first came out red all over, like a hairy garment.

        They named him Esau.

025:026 After that, his brother came out, and his hand had hold on

        Esau's heel.  He was named Jacob.  Isaac was sixty years old

        when she bore them.

025:027 The boys grew.  Esau was a skillful hunter, a man of the field.

        Jacob was a quiet man, living in tents.

025:028 Now Isaac loved Esau, because he ate his venison.

        Rebekah loved Jacob.

025:029 Jacob boiled stew.  Esau came in from the field,

        and he was famished.

025:030 Esau said to Jacob, "Please feed me with that same red stew,

        for I am famished."  Therefore his name was called Edom.

025:031 Jacob said, "First, sell me your birthright."

025:032 Esau said, "Behold, I am about to die.  What good is the

        birthright to me?"

025:033 Jacob said, "Swear to me first."  He swore to him.

        He sold his birthright to Jacob.

025:034 Jacob gave Esau bread and stew of lentils.  He ate and drank,

        rose up, and went his way.  So Esau despised his birthright.

026:001 There was a famine in the land, besides the first famine

        that was in the days of Abraham.  Isaac went to Abimelech

        king of the Philistines, to Gerar.

026:002 Yahweh appeared to him, and said, "Don't go down into Egypt.

        Live in the land I will tell you about.

026:003 Sojourn in this land, and I will be with you, and will bless you.

        For to you, and to your seed, I will give all these lands, and I

        will establish the oath which I swore to Abraham your father.

026:004 I will multiply your seed as the stars of the sky, and will

        give to your seed all these lands.  In your seed will all

        the nations of the earth be blessed,

026:005 because Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge,

        my commandments, my statutes, and my laws."

026:006 Isaac lived in Gerar.

026:007 The men of the place asked him about his wife.  He said,

        "She is my sister," for he was afraid to say, "My wife,"

        lest, he thought, "the men of the place might kill me for Rebekah,

        because she is beautiful to look at."

026:008 It happened, when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech

        king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and saw,

        and, behold, Isaac was caressing Rebekah, his wife.

026:009 Abimelech called Isaac, and said, "Behold, surely she is your wife.

        Why did you say, 'She is my sister?'"  Isaac said to him,

        "Because I said, 'Lest I die because of her.'"

026:010 Abimelech said, "What is this you have done to us?

        One of the people might easily have lain with your wife,

        and you would have brought guilt on us!"

026:011 Abimelech charged all the people, saying, "He who touches this

        man or his wife will surely be put to death."

026:012 Isaac sowed in that land, and reaped in the same year one

        hundred times what he planted.  Yahweh blessed him.

026:013 The man grew great, and grew more and more until he

        became very great.

026:014 He had possessions of flocks, possessions of herds,

        and a great household.  The Philistines envied him.

026:015 Now all the wells which his father's servants had dug in

        the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped,

        and filled with earth.

026:016 Abimelech said to Isaac, "Go from us, for you are much

        mightier than we."

026:017 Isaac departed from there, encamped in the valley of Gerar,

        and lived there.

026:018 Isaac dug again the wells of water, which they had dug in the days

        of Abraham his father.  For the Philistines had stopped them

        after the death of Abraham.  He called their names after

        the names by which his father had called them.

026:019 Isaac's servants dug in the valley, and found there a well

        of springing water.

026:020 The herdsmen of Gerar argued with Isaac's herdsmen, saying,

        "The water is ours."  He called the name of the well Esek,

        because they contended with him.

026:021 They dug another well, and they argued over that, also.

        He called the name of it Sitnah.

026:022 He left that place, and dug another well.  They didn't

        argue over that one.  He called it Rehoboth.  He said,

        "For now Yahweh has made room for us, and we will be fruitful

        in the land."

026:023 He went up from there to Beersheba.

026:024 Yahweh appeared to him the same night, and said, "I am

        the God of Abraham your father.  Don't be afraid, for I am

        with you, and will bless you, and multiply your seed for my

        servant Abraham's sake."

026:025 He built an altar there, and called on the name of Yahweh,

        and pitched his tent there.  There Isaac's servants dug a well.

026:026 Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath his friend,

        and Phicol the captain of his army.

026:027 Isaac said to them, "Why have you come to me, since you hate me,

        and have sent me away from you?"

026:028 They said, "We saw plainly that Yahweh was with you.

        We said, 'Let there now be an oath between us, even between us

        and you, and let us make a covenant with you,

026:029 that you will do us no harm, as we have not touched you,

        and as we have done to you nothing but good, and have sent

        you away in peace.'  You are now the blessed of Yahweh."

026:030 He made them a feast, and they ate and drank.

026:031 They rose up some time in the morning, and swore one to another.

        Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him in peace.

026:032 It happened the same day, that Isaac's servants came, and told

        him concerning the well which they had dug, and said to him,

        "We have found water."

026:033 He called it Shibah.{Shibah means "oath" or "seven."} Therefore

        the name of the city is Beersheba{Beersheba means "well of the oath"

        or "well of the seven"} to this day.

026:034 When Esau was forty years old, he took as wife Judith,

        the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath, the daughter

        of Elon the Hittite.

026:035 They grieved Isaac's and Rebekah's spirits.

027:001 It happened, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes were dim,

        so that he could not see, he called Esau his elder son,

        and said to him, "My son?"  He said to him, "Here I am."

027:002 He said, "See now, I am old.  I don't know the day of my death.

027:003 Now therefore, please take your weapons, your quiver and your bow,

        and go out to the field, and take me venison.

027:004 Make me savory food, such as I love, and bring it to me,

        that I may eat, and that my soul may bless you before I die."

027:005 Rebekah heard when Isaac spoke to Esau his son.

        Esau went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it.

027:006 Rebekah spoke to Jacob her son, saying, "Behold, I heard

        your father speak to Esau your brother, saying,

027:007 'Bring me venison, and make me savory food, that I may eat,

        and bless you before Yahweh before my death.'

027:008 Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which

        I command you.

027:009 Go now to the flock, and get me from there two good kids

        of the goats.  I will make them savory food for your father,

        such as he loves.

027:010 You shall bring it to your father, that he may eat, so that

        he may bless you before his death."

027:011 Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, "Behold, Esau my brother

        is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man.

027:012 What if my father touches me?  I will seem to him as a deceiver,

        and I would bring a curse on myself, and not a blessing."

027:013 His mother said to him, "Let your curse be on me, my son.

        Only obey my voice, and go get them for me."

027:014 He went, and got them, and brought them to his mother.

        His mother made savory food, such as his father loved.

027:015 Rebekah took the good clothes of Esau, her elder son,

        which were with her in the house, and put them on Jacob,

        her younger son.

027:016 She put the skins of the kids of the goats on his hands,

        and on the smooth of his neck.

027:017 She gave the savory food and the bread, which she had prepared,

        into the hand of her son Jacob.

027:018 He came to his father, and said, "My father?"  He said, "Here I am.

        Who are you, my son?"

027:019 Jacob said to his father, "I am Esau your firstborn.

        I have done what you asked me to do.  Please arise, sit and eat

        of my venison, that your soul may bless me."

027:020 Isaac said to his son, "How is it that you have found it so quickly,

        my son?"  He said, "Because Yahweh your God gave me success."

027:021 Isaac said to Jacob, "Please come near, that I may feel you,

        my son, whether you are really my son Esau or not."

027:022 Jacob went near to Isaac his father.  He felt him, and said,

        "The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau."

027:023 He didn't recognize him, because his hands were hairy,

        like his brother, Esau's hands.  So he blessed him.

027:024 He said, "Are you really my son Esau?"  He said, "I am."

027:025 He said, "Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son's venison,

        that my soul may bless you."  He brought it near to him, and he ate.

        He brought him wine, and he drank.

027:026 His father Isaac said to him, "Come near now, and kiss me, my son."

027:027 He came near, and kissed him.  He smelled the smell of his clothing,

        and blessed him, and said, "Behold, the smell of my son

        is as the smell of a field which Yahweh has blessed.

027:028 God give you of the dew of the sky, of the fatness of the earth,

        and plenty of grain and new wine.

027:029 Let peoples serve you, and nations bow down to you.

        Be lord over your brothers.  Let your mother's sons

        bow down to you.  Cursed be everyone who curses you.

        Blessed be everyone who blesses you."

027:030 It happened, as soon as Isaac had made an end of blessing Jacob,

        and Jacob had just gone out from the presence of Isaac his father,

        that Esau his brother came in from his hunting.

027:031 He also made savory food, and brought it to his father.

        He said to his father, "Let my father arise, and eat of his

        son's venison, that your soul may bless me."

027:032 Isaac his father said to him, "Who are you?"  He said,

        "I am your son, your firstborn, Esau."

027:033 Isaac trembled violently, and said, "Who, then, is he who has

        taken venison, and brought it me, and I have eaten of all before

        you came, and have blessed him?  Yes, he will be blessed."

027:034 When Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with an

        exceeding great and bitter cry, and said to his father,

        "Bless me, even me also, my father."

027:035 He said, "Your brother came with deceit, and has taken

        away your blessing."

027:036 He said, "Isn't he rightly named Jacob?  For he has

        supplanted me these two times.  He took away my birthright.

        See, now he has taken away my blessing."  He said, "Haven't you

        reserved a blessing for me?"

027:037 Isaac answered Esau, "Behold, I have made him your lord,

        and all his brothers have I given to him for servants.

        With grain and new wine have I sustained him.  What then

        will I do for you, my son?"

027:038 Esau said to his father, "Have you but one blessing, my father?

        Bless me, even me also, my father."  Esau lifted up

        his voice, and wept.

027:039 Isaac his father answered him, "Behold, of the fatness of the earth

        will be your dwelling, and of the dew of the sky from above.

027:040 By your sword will you live, and you will serve your brother.

        It will happen, when you will break loose, that you shall

        shake his yoke from off your neck."

027:041 Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing with which his father

        blessed him.  Esau said in his heart, "The days of mourning

        for my father are at hand.  Then I will kill my brother Jacob."

027:042 The words of Esau, her elder son, were told to Rebekah.

        She sent and called Jacob, her younger son, and said

        to him, "Behold, your brother Esau comforts himself about you

        by planning to kill you.

027:043 Now therefore, my son, obey my voice.  Arise, flee to Laban,

        my brother, in Haran.

027:044 Stay with him a few days, until your brother's fury turns away;

027:045 until your brother's anger turn away from you, and he forgets what

        you have done to him.  Then I will send, and get you from there.

        Why should I be bereaved of you both in one day?"

027:046 Rebekah said to Isaac, "I am weary of my life because of

        the daughters of Heth.  If Jacob takes a wife of the daughters

        of Heth, such as these, of the daughters of the land,

        what good will my life do me?"

028:001 Isaac called Jacob, blessed him, and commanded him, "You shall

        not take a wife of the daughters of Canaan.

028:002 Arise, go to Paddan Aram, to the house of Bethuel your

        mother's father.  Take a wife from there from the daughters

        of Laban, your mother's brother.

028:003 May God Almighty bless you, and make you fruitful, and multiply you,

        that you may be a company of peoples,

028:004 and give you the blessing of Abraham, to you, and to your seed

        with you, that you may inherit the land where you travel,

        which God gave to Abraham."

028:005 Isaac sent Jacob away.  He went to Paddan Aram to Laban, son of

        Bethuel the Syrian, Rebekah's brother, Jacob's and Esau's mother.

028:006 Now Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him away

        to Paddan Aram, to take him a wife from there, and that as

        he blessed him he gave him a charge, saying, "You shall not

        take a wife of the daughters of Canaan,"

028:007 and that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother, and was gone

        to Paddan Aram.

028:008 Esau saw that the daughters of Canaan didn't please Isaac,

        his father.

028:009 Esau went to Ishmael, and took, besides the wives that he had,

        Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael, Abraham's son, the sister

        of Nebaioth, to be his wife.

028:010 Jacob went out from Beersheba, and went toward Haran.

028:011 He came to a certain place, and stayed there all night,

        because the sun had set.  He took one of the stones of the place,

        and put it under his head, and lay down in that place to sleep.

028:012 He dreamed.  Behold, a stairway set upon the earth, and the top

        of it reached to heaven.  Behold, the angels of God ascending

        and descending on it.

028:013 Behold, Yahweh stood above it, and said, "I am Yahweh,

        the God of Abraham your father, and the God of Isaac.

        The land whereon you lie, to you will I give it, and to your seed.

028:014 Your seed will be as the dust of the earth, and you will spread

        abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north,

        and to the south.  In you and in your seed will all the families

        of the earth be blessed.

028:015 Behold, I am with you, and will keep you, wherever you go,

        and will bring you again into this land.  For I will not leave you,

        until I have done that which I have spoken of to you."

028:016 Jacob awakened out of his sleep, and he said, "Surely Yahweh

        is in this place, and I didn't know it."

028:017 He was afraid, and said, "How dreadful is this place!

        This is none other than God's house, and this is the

        gate of heaven."

028:018 Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone

        that he had put under his head, and set it up for a pillar,

        and poured oil on the top of it.

028:019 He called the name of that place Bethel, but the name of the city

        was Luz at the first.

028:020 Jacob vowed a vow, saying, "If God will be with me, and will

        keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat,

        and clothing to put on,

028:021 so that I come again to my father's house in peace, and Yahweh

        will be my God,

028:022 then this stone, which I have set up for a pillar, will be

        God's house.  Of all that you will give me I will surely give

        the tenth to you."

029:001 Then Jacob went on his journey, and came to the land of

        the children of the east.

029:002 He looked, and behold, a well in the field, and, behold, three flocks

        of sheep lying there by it.  For out of that well they watered

        the flocks.  The stone on the well's mouth was large.

029:003 There all the flocks were gathered.  They rolled the stone

        from the well's mouth, and watered the sheep, and put the stone

        again on the well's mouth in its place.

029:004 Jacob said to them, "My relatives, where are you from?"

        They said, "We are from Haran."

029:005 He said to them, "Do you know Laban, the son of Nahor?"  They said,

        "We know him."

029:006 He said to them, "Is it well with him?"  They said, "It is well.

        See, Rachel, his daughter, is coming with the sheep."

029:007 He said, "Behold, it is still the middle of the day,

        not time to gather the livestock together.  Water the sheep,

        and go and feed them."

029:008 They said, "We can't, until all the flocks are gathered

        together, and they roll the stone from the well's mouth.

        Then we water the sheep."

029:009 While he was yet speaking with them, Rachel came with her

        father's sheep, for she kept them.

029:010 It happened, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban,

        his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban, his mother's brother,

        that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone from the well's mouth,

        and watered the flock of Laban his mother's brother.

029:011 Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept.

029:012 Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's brother, and that

        he was Rebekah's son.  She ran and told her father.

029:013 It happened, when Laban heard the news of Jacob, his sister's son,

        that he ran to meet Jacob, and embraced him, and kissed him,

        and brought him to his house.  Jacob told Laban all these things.

029:014 Laban said to him, Surely you are my bone and my flesh.

        He lived with him for a month.

029:015 Laban said to Jacob, "Because you are my brother, should you

        therefore serve me for nothing?  Tell me, what will

        your wages be?"

029:016 Laban had two daughters.  The name of the elder was Leah,

        and the name of the younger was Rachel.

029:017 Leah's eyes were weak, but Rachel was beautiful in

        form and attractive.

029:018 Jacob loved Rachel.  He said, "I will serve you seven years

        for Rachel, your younger daughter."

029:019 Laban said, "It is better that I give her to you, than that I

        should give her to another man.  Stay with me."

029:020 Jacob served seven years for Rachel.  They seemed to him

        but a few days, for the love he had for her.

029:021 Jacob said to Laban, "Give me my wife, for my days are fulfilled,

        that I may go in to her."

029:022 Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast.

029:023 It happened in the evening, that he took Leah his daughter,

        and brought her to him.  He went in to her.

029:024 Laban gave Zilpah his handmaid to his daughter Leah for a handmaid.

029:025 It happened in the morning that, behold, it was Leah.

        He said to Laban, "What is this you have done to me?

        Didn't I serve with you for Rachel?  Why then have

        you deceived me?"

029:026 Laban said, "It is not done so in our place, to give the younger

        before the firstborn.

029:027 Fulfill the week of this one, and we will give you the other

        also for the service which you will serve with me yet

        seven other years."

029:028 Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week.  He gave him Rachel

        his daughter as wife.

029:029 Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah, his handmaid,

        to be her handmaid.

029:030 He went in also to Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more than Leah,

        and served with him yet seven other years.

029:031 Yahweh saw that Leah was hated, and he opened her womb,

        but Rachel was barren.

029:032 Leah conceived, and bore a son, and she named him Reuben.

        For she said, "Because Yahweh has looked at my affliction.

        For now my husband will love me."

029:033 She conceived again, and bore a son, and said, "Because Yahweh has

        heard that I am hated, he has therefore given me this son also."

        She named him Simeon.

029:034 She conceived again, and bore a son.  Said, "Now this time will my

        husband be joined to me, because I have borne him three sons."

        Therefore was his name called Levi.

029:035 She conceived again, and bore a son.  She said, "This time

        will I praise Yahweh."  Therefore she named him Judah.

        Then she stopped bearing.

030:001 When Rachel saw that she bore Jacob no children, Rachel envied

        her sister.  She said to Jacob, "Give me children, or else

        I will die."

030:002 Jacob's anger was kindled against Rachel, and he said,

        "Am I in God's place, who has withheld from you the fruit

        of the womb?"

030:003 She said, "Behold, my maid Bilhah.  Go in to her, that she

        may bear on my knees, and I also may obtain children by her."

030:004 She gave him Bilhah her handmaid as wife, and Jacob went

        in to her.

030:005 Bilhah conceived, and bore Jacob a son.

030:006 Rachel said, "God has judged me, and has also heard my voice,

        and has given me a son."  Therefore called she his name Dan.

030:007 Bilhah, Rachel's handmaid, conceived again, and bore Jacob

        a second son.

030:008 Rachel said, "With mighty wrestlings have I wrestled with my sister,

        and have prevailed."  She named him Naphtali.

030:009 When Leah saw that she had finished bearing, she took Zilpah,

        her handmaid, and gave her to Jacob as a wife.

030:010 Zilpah, Leah's handmaid, bore Jacob a son.

030:011 Leah said, "How fortunate!"  She named him Gad.

030:012 Zilpah, Leah's handmaid, bore Jacob a second son.

030:013 Leah said, "Happy am I, for the daughters will call me happy."

        She named him Asher.

030:014 Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found mandrakes

        in the field, and brought them to his mother, Leah.  Then Rachel

        said to Leah, "Please give me some of your son's mandrakes."

030:015 She said to her, "Is it a small matter that you have taken away

        my husband?  Would you take away my son's mandrakes, also?"

        Rachel said, "Therefore he will lie with you tonight for

        your son's mandrakes."

030:016 Jacob came from the field in the evening, and Leah went

        out to meet him, and said, "You must come in to me;

        for I have surely hired you with my son's mandrakes."

        He lay with her that night.

030:017 God listened to Leah, and she conceived, and bore Jacob

        a fifth son.

030:018 Leah said, "God has given me my hire, because I gave my handmaid

        to my husband."  She named him Issachar.

030:019 Leah conceived again, and bore a sixth son to Jacob.

030:020 Leah said, "God has endowed me with a good dowry.  Now my

        husband will live with me, because I have borne him six sons."

        She named him Zebulun.

030:021 Afterwards, she bore a daughter, and named her Dinah.

030:022 God remembered Rachel, and God listened to her, and opened her womb.

030:023 She conceived, bore a son, and said, "God has taken

        away my reproach."

030:024 She named him Joseph,{Joseph means "may he add."} saying,

        "May Yahweh add another son to me."

030:025 It happened, when Rachel had borne Joseph, that Jacob said

        to Laban, "Send me away, that I may go to my own place,

        and to my country.

030:026 Give me my wives and my children for whom I have served you,

        and let me go; for you know my service with which I

        have served you."

030:027 Laban said to him, "If now I have found favor in your eyes,

        stay here, for I have divined that Yahweh has blessed me

        for your sake."

030:028 He said, "Appoint me your wages, and I will give it."

030:029 He said to him, "You know how I have served you, and how your

        livestock have fared with me.

030:030 For it was little which you had before I came, and it has increased

        to a multitude.  Yahweh has blessed you wherever I turned.

        Now when will I provide for my own house also?"

030:031 He said, "What shall I give you?"  Jacob said, "You shall

        not give me anything.  If you will do this thing for me,

        I will again feed your flock and keep it.

030:032 I will pass through all your flock today, removing from there

        every speckled and spotted one, and every black one among

        the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats.

        This will be my hire.

030:033 So my righteousness will answer for me hereafter,

        when you come concerning my hire that is before you.

        Every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats,

        and black among the sheep, that might be with me,

        will be counted stolen."

030:034 Laban said, "Behold, I desire it to be according to your word."

030:035 That day, he removed the male goats that were streaked and spotted,

        and all the female goats that were speckled and spotted,

        every one that had white in it, and all the black ones among

        the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons.

030:036 He set three days' journey between himself and Jacob,

        and Jacob fed the rest of Laban's flocks.

030:037 Jacob took to himself rods of fresh poplar, almond, plane tree,

        peeled white streaks in them, and made the white appear

        which was in the rods.

030:038 He set the rods which he had peeled opposite the flocks in the

        gutters in the watering-troughs where the flocks came to drink.

        They conceived when they came to drink.

030:039 The flocks conceived before the rods, and the flocks brought

        forth streaked, speckled, and spotted.

030:040 Jacob separated the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks

        toward the streaked and all the black in the flock of Laban:

        and he put his own droves apart, and didn't put them

        into Laban's flock.

030:041 It happened, whenever the stronger of the flock conceived,

        that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the flock

        in the gutters, that they might conceive among the rods;

030:042 but when the flock were feeble, he didn't put them in.

        So the feebler were Laban's, and the stronger Jacob's.

030:043 The man increased exceedingly, and had large flocks,

        female servants and male servants, and camels and donkeys.

031:001 He heard the words of Laban's sons, saying, "Jacob has taken away

        all that was our father's. From that which was our father's,

        has he gotten all this wealth."

031:002 Jacob saw the expression on Laban's face, and, behold, it was

        not toward him as before.

031:003 Yahweh said to Jacob, "Return to the land of your fathers,

        and to your relatives, and I will be with you."

031:004 Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field to his flock,

031:005 and said to them, "I see the expression on your father's face,

        that it is not toward me as before; but the God of my father

        has been with me.

031:006 You know that I have served your father with all of my strength.

031:007 Your father has deceived me, and changed my wages ten times,

        but God didn't allow him to hurt me.

031:008 If he said this, 'The speckled will be your wages,' then all

        the flock bore speckled.  If he said this, 'The streaked

        will be your wages,' then all the flock bore streaked.

031:009 Thus God has taken away your father's livestock, and given

        them to me.

031:010 It happened during mating season that I lifted up my eyes,

        and saw in a dream, and behold, the male goats which leaped

        on the flock were streaked, speckled, and grizzled.

031:011 The angel of God said to me in the dream, 'Jacob,' and I said,

        'Here I am.'

031:012 He said, 'Now lift up your eyes, and behold, all the male goats

        which leap on the flock are streaked, speckled, and grizzled,

        for I have seen all that Laban does to you.

031:013 I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed a pillar, where you

        vowed a vow to me.  Now arise, get out from this land,

        and return to the land of your birth.'"

031:014 Rachel and Leah answered him, "Is there yet any portion

        or inheritance for us in our father's house?

031:015 Aren't we accounted by him as foreigners?  For he has sold us,

        and has also quite devoured our money.

031:016 For all the riches which God has taken away from our father,

        that is ours and our children's. Now then, whatever God has

        said to you, do."

031:017 Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives on the camels,

031:018 and he took away all his livestock, and all his possessions

        which he had gathered, including the livestock which

        he had gained in Paddan Aram, to go to Isaac his father,

        to the land of Canaan.

031:019 Now Laban had gone to shear his sheep:  and Rachel stole

        the teraphim{teraphim were household idols that may have been

        associated with inheritance rights to the household property.}

        that were her father's.

031:020 Jacob deceived Laban the Syrian, in that he didn't tell him

        that he was running away.

031:021 So he fled with all that he had.  He rose up, passed over the River,

        and set his face toward the mountain of Gilead.

031:022 Laban was told on the third day that Jacob had fled.

031:023 He took his relatives with him, and pursued after him

        seven days' journey.  He overtook him in the mountain of Gilead.

031:024 God came to Laban, the Syrian, in a dream of the night,

        and said to him, "Take heed to yourself that you don't speak

        to Jacob either good or bad."

031:025 Laban caught up with Jacob.  Now Jacob had pitched his tent

        in the mountain, and Laban with his relatives encamped

        in the mountain of Gilead.

031:026 Laban said to Jacob, "What have you done, that you have deceived me,

        and carried away my daughters like captives of the sword?

031:027 Why did you flee secretly, and deceive me, and didn't tell me,

        that I might have sent you away with mirth and with songs,

        with tambourine and with harp;

031:028 and didn't allow me to kiss my sons and my daughters?

        Now have you done foolishly.

031:029 It is in the power of my hand to hurt you, but the God of your

        father spoke to me last night, saying, 'Take heed to yourself

        that you don't speak to Jacob either good or bad.'

031:030 Now, you want to be gone, because you greatly longed for your

        father's house, but why have you stolen my gods?"

031:031 Jacob answered Laban, "Because I was afraid, for I said,

        'Lest you should take your daughters from me by force.'

031:032 Anyone you find your gods with shall not live.

        Before our relatives, discern what is yours with me, and take it."

        For Jacob didn't know that Rachel had stolen them.

031:033 Laban went into Jacob's tent, into Leah's tent, and into

        the tent of the two female servants; but he didn't find them.

        He went out of Leah's tent, and entered into Rachel's tent.

031:034 Now Rachel had taken the teraphim, put them in the camel's

        saddle, and sat on them.  Laban felt about all the tent,

        but didn't find them.

031:035 She said to her father, "Don't let my lord be angry that I

        can't rise up before you; for the manner of women is on me."

        He searched, but didn't find the teraphim.

031:036 Jacob was angry, and argued with Laban.  Jacob answered

        Laban, "What is my trespass?  What is my sin, that you have

        hotly pursued after me?

031:037 Now that you have felt around in all my stuff, what have you found

        of all your household stuff?  Set it here before my relatives

        and your relatives, that they may judge between us two.

031:038 These twenty years I have been with you.  Your ewes and your

        female goats have not cast their young, and I haven't eaten

        the rams of your flocks.

031:039 That which was torn of animals, I didn't bring to you.

        I bore the loss of it.  Of my hand you required it,

        whether stolen by day or stolen by night.

031:040 This was my situation:  in the day the drought consumed me,

        and the frost by night; and my sleep fled from my eyes.

031:041 These twenty years I have been in your house.  I served you fourteen

        years for your two daughters, and six years for your flock,

        and you have changed my wages ten times.

031:042 Unless the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear

        of Isaac, had been with me, surely now you would have sent me

        away empty.  God has seen my affliction and the labor of my hands,

        and rebuked you last night."

031:043 Laban answered Jacob, "The daughters are my daughters,

        the children are my children, the flocks are my flocks,

        and all that you see is mine:  and what can I do this day to

        these my daughters, or to their children whom they have borne?

031:044 Now come, let us make a covenant, you and I; and let it be

        for a witness between me and you."

031:045 Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar.

031:046 Jacob said to his relatives, "Gather stones."  They took stones,

        and made a heap.  They ate there by the heap.

031:047 Laban called it Jegar Sahadutha,{"Jegar Sahadutha"

        means "Witness Heap" in Aramaic.} but Jacob called

        it Galeed.{"Galeed" means "Witness Heap" in Hebrew.}

031:048 Laban said, "This heap is witness between me and you this day."

        Therefore it was named Galeed

031:049 and Mizpah, for he said, "Yahweh watch between me and you,

        when we are absent one from another.

031:050 If you afflict my daughters, or if you take wives besides

        my daughters, no man is with us; behold, God is witness

        between me and you."

031:051 Laban said to Jacob, "See this heap, and see the pillar,

        which I have set between me and you.

031:052 May this heap be a witness, and the pillar be a witness,

        that I will not pass over this heap to you, and that you

        will not pass over this heap and this pillar to me, for harm.

031:053 The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their father,

        judge between us."  Then Jacob swore by the fear of

        his father, Isaac.

031:054 Jacob offered a sacrifice in the mountain, and called his

        relatives to eat bread.  They ate bread, and stayed all night

        in the mountain.

031:055 Early in the morning, Laban rose up, and kissed his sons and

        his daughters, and blessed them.  Laban departed and returned

        to his place.

032:001 Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.

032:002 When he saw them, Jacob said, "This is God's army."

        He called the name of that place Mahanaim.

032:003 Jacob sent messengers in front of him to Esau, his brother,

        to the land of Seir, the field of Edom.

032:004 He commanded them, saying, "This is what you shall tell

        my lord, Esau:  'This is what your servant, Jacob, says.

        I have lived as a foreigner with Laban, and stayed until now.

032:005 I have oxen, donkeys, flocks, male servants, and female servants.

        I have sent to tell my lord, that I may find favor in your sight.'"

032:006 The messengers returned to Jacob, saying, "We came to your

        brother Esau.  Not only that, but he comes to meet you,

        and four hundred men with him."

032:007 Then Jacob was greatly afraid and was distressed.

        He divided the people who were with him, and the flocks,

        and the herds, and the camels, into two companies;

032:008 and he said, "If Esau comes to the one company, and strikes it,

        then the company which is left will escape."

032:009 Jacob said, "God of my father Abraham, and God of my

        father Isaac, Yahweh, who said to me, 'Return to your country,

        and to your relatives, and I will do you good,'

032:010 I am not worthy of the least of all the loving kindnesses,

        and of all the truth, which you have shown to your servant;

        for with just my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I

        have become two companies.

032:011 Please deliver me from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau:

        for I fear him, lest he come and strike me, and the mothers

        with the children.

032:012 You said, 'I will surely do you good, and make your seed

        as the sand of the sea, which can't be numbered because there

        are so many.'"

032:013 He lodged there that night, and took from that which he had

        with him, a present for Esau, his brother:

032:014 two hundred female goats and twenty male goats, two hundred

        ewes and twenty rams,

032:015 thirty milk camels and their colts, forty cows, ten bulls,

        twenty female donkeys and ten foals.

032:016 He delivered them into the hands of his servants, every herd

        by itself, and said to his servants, "Pass over before me,

        and put a space between herd and herd."

032:017 He commanded the foremost, saying, "When Esau, my brother, meets you,

        and asks you, saying, 'Whose are you?  Where are you going?

        Whose are these before you?'

032:018 Then you shall say, 'They are your servant, Jacob's. It is a

        present sent to my lord, Esau.  Behold, he also is behind us.'"

032:019 He commanded also the second, and the third, and all that followed

        the herds, saying, "This is how you shall speak to Esau,

        when you find him.

032:020 You shall say, 'Not only that, but behold, your servant, Jacob,

        is behind us.'"  For, he said, "I will appease him with the present

        that goes before me, and afterward I will see his face.

        Perhaps he will accept me."

032:021 So the present passed over before him, and he himself lodged

        that night in the camp.

032:022 He rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two handmaids,

        and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford of the Jabbok.

032:023 He took them, and sent them over the stream, and sent over

        that which he had.

032:024 Jacob was left alone, and wrestled with a man there until

        the breaking of the day.

032:025 When he saw that he didn't prevail against him, he touched

        the hollow of his thigh, and the hollow of Jacob's thigh

        was strained, as he wrestled.

032:026 The man said, "Let me go, for the day breaks."  Jacob said,

        "I won't let you go, unless you bless me."

032:027 He said to him, "What is your name?"  He said, "Jacob."

032:028 He said, "Your name will no longer be called Jacob, but Israel;

        for you have fought with God and with men, and have prevailed."

032:029 Jacob asked him, "Please tell me your name."

        He said, "Why is it that you ask what my name is?"

        He blessed him there.

032:030 Jacob called the name of the place Peniel{Peniel means "face

        of God."}: for, he said, "I have seen God face to face,

        and my life is preserved."

032:031 The sun rose on him as he passed over Peniel, and he limped

        because of his thigh.

032:032 Therefore the children of Israel don't eat the sinew of

        the hip, which is on the hollow of the thigh, to this day,

        because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew

        of the hip.

033:001 Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau was coming,

        and with him four hundred men.  He divided the children

        between Leah, Rachel, and the two handmaids.

033:002 He put the handmaids and their children in front, Leah and her

        children after, and Rachel and Joseph at the rear.

033:003 He himself passed over in front of them, and bowed himself

        to the ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.

033:004 Esau ran to meet him, embraced him, fell on his neck, kissed him,

        and they wept.

033:005 He lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children;

        and said, "Who are these with you?"  He said, "The children

        whom God has graciously given your servant."

033:006 Then the handmaids came near with their children,

        and they bowed themselves.

033:007 Leah also and her children came near, and bowed themselves.

        After them, Joseph came near with Rachel, and they bowed themselves.

033:008 Esau said, "What do you mean by all this company which I met?"

        Jacob said, "To find favor in the sight of my lord."

033:009 Esau said, "I have enough, my brother; let that which you

        have be yours."

033:010 Jacob said, "Please, no, if I have now found favor in your sight,

        then receive my present at my hand, because I have seen your face,

        as one sees the face of God, and you were pleased with me.

033:011 Please take the gift that I brought to you, because God has

        dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough."

        He urged him, and he took it.

033:012 Esau said, "Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I

        will go before you."

033:013 Jacob said to him, "My lord knows that the children are tender,

        and that the flocks and herds with me have their young,

        and if they overdrive them one day, all the flocks will die.

033:014 Please let my lord pass over before his servant, and I

        will lead on gently, according to the pace of the livestock

        that are before me and according to the pace of the children,

        until I come to my lord to Seir."

033:015 Esau said, "Let me now leave with you some of the folk who are

        with me."  He said, "Why?  Let me find favor in the sight

        of my lord."

033:016 So Esau returned that day on his way to Seir.

033:017 Jacob traveled to Succoth, built himself a house, and made

        shelters for his livestock.  Therefore the name of the place

        is called Succoth.{succoth means shelters or booths.}

033:018 Jacob came in peace to the city of Shechem, which is

        in the land of Canaan, when he came from Paddan Aram;

        and encamped before the city.

033:019 He bought the parcel of ground where he had spread his tent,

        at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem's father,

        for one hundred pieces of money.

033:020 He erected an altar there, and called it El Elohe Israel.{El

        Elohe Israel means "God, the God of Israel" or "The God

        of Israel is mighty."}

034:001 Dinah, the daughter of Leah, whom she bore to Jacob, went out

        to see the daughters of the land.

034:002 Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, the prince of the land, saw her.

        He took her, lay with her, and humbled her.

034:003 His soul joined to Dinah, the daughter of Jacob, and he loved

        the young lady, and spoke kindly to the young lady.

034:004 Shechem spoke to his father, Hamor, saying, "Get me this young

        lady as a wife."

034:005 Now Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah, his daughter;

        and his sons were with his livestock in the field.

        Jacob held his peace until they came.

034:006 Hamor the father of Shechem went out to Jacob to talk with him.

034:007 The sons of Jacob came in from the field when they heard it.

        The men were grieved, and they were very angry, because he

        had done folly in Israel in lying with Jacob's daughter;

        a which thing ought not to be done.

034:008 Hamor talked with them, saying, "The soul of my son, Shechem,

        longs for your daughter.  Please give her to him as a wife.

034:009 Make marriages with us.  Give your daughters to us, and take

        our daughters for yourselves.

034:010 You shall dwell with us, and the land will be before you.

        Live and trade in it, and get possessions in it."

034:011 Shechem said to her father and to her brothers, "Let me find

        favor in your eyes, and whatever you will tell me I will give.

034:012 Ask me a great amount for a dowry, and I will give whatever

        you ask of me, but give me the young lady as a wife."

034:013 The sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father with deceit,

        and spoke, because he had defiled Dinah their sister,

034:014 and said to them, "We can't do this thing, to give our sister

        to one who is uncircumcised; for that is a reproach to us.

034:015 Only on this condition will we consent to you.  If you will

        be as we are, that every male of you be circumcised;

034:016 then will we give our daughters to you, and we will take

        your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we

        will become one people.

034:017 But if you will not listen to us, to be circumcised, then we

        will take our sister,{Hebrew has, literally, "daughter"} and we

        will be gone."

034:018 Their words pleased Hamor and Shechem, Hamor's son.

034:019 The young man didn't wait to do this thing, because he had delight

        in Jacob's daughter, and he was honored above all the house

        of his father.

034:020 Hamor and Shechem, his son, came to the gate of their city,

        and talked with the men of their city, saying,

034:021 "These men are peaceful with us.  Therefore let them live in the land

        and trade in it.  For behold, the land is large enough for them.

        Let us take their daughters to us for wives, and let us give

        them our daughters.

034:022 Only on this condition will the men consent to us to live with us,

        to become one people, if every male among us is circumcised,

        as they are circumcised.

034:023 Won't their livestock and their possessions and all their

        animals be ours?  Only let us give our consent to them,

        and they will dwell with us."

034:024 All who went out of the gate of his city listened to Hamor,

        and to Shechem his son; and every male was circumcised,

        all who went out of the gate of his city.

034:025 It happened on the third day, when they were sore,

        that two of Jacob's sons, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's brothers,

        each took his sword, came upon the unsuspecting city,

        and killed all the males.

034:026 They killed Hamor and Shechem, his son, with the edge of the sword,

        and took Dinah out of Shechem's house, and went away.

034:027 Jacob's sons came on the dead, and plundered the city,

        because they had defiled their sister.

034:028 They took their flocks, their herds, their donkeys, that which

        was in the city, that which was in the field,

034:029 and all their wealth.  They took captive all their little ones

        and their wives, and took as plunder everything that was

        in the house.

034:030 Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, "You have troubled me,

        to make me odious to the inhabitants of the land,

        among the Canaanites and the Perizzites.  I am few in number.

        They will gather themselves together against me and strike me,

        and I will be destroyed, I and my house."

034:031 They said, "Should he deal with our sister as with a prostitute?"

035:001 God said to Jacob, "Arise, go up to Bethel, and live there.

        Make there an altar to God, who appeared to you when you fled

        from the face of Esau your brother."

035:002 Then Jacob said to his household, and to all who were with him,

        "Put away the foreign gods that are among you, purify yourselves,

        change your garments.

035:003 Let us arise, and go up to Bethel.  I will make there

        an altar to God, who answered me in the day of my distress,

        and was with me in the way which I went."

035:004 They gave to Jacob all the foreign gods which were in their hands,

        and the rings which were in their ears; and Jacob hid them

        under the oak which was by Shechem.

035:005 They traveled, and a terror of God was on the cities that were

        around them, and they didn't pursue the sons of Jacob.

035:006 So Jacob came to Luz (that is, Bethel), which is in the land

        of Canaan, he and all the people who were with him.

035:007 He built an altar there, and called the place El Beth El;

        because there God was revealed to him, when he fled from

        the face of his brother.

035:008 Deborah, Rebekah's nurse, died, and she was buried below Bethel

        under the oak; and the name of it was called Allon Bacuth.

035:009 God appeared to Jacob again, when he came from Paddan Aram,

        and blessed him.

035:010 God said to him, "Your name is Jacob.  Your name shall

        not be Jacob any more, but your name will be Israel."

        He named him Israel.

035:011 God said to him, "I am God Almighty.  Be fruitful and multiply.

        A nation and a company of nations will be from you, and kings

        will come out of your body.

035:012 The land which I gave to Abraham and Isaac, I will give it to you,

        and to your seed after you will I give the land."

035:013 God went up from him in the place where he spoke with him.

035:014 Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he spoke with him,

        a pillar of stone.  He poured out a drink offering on it,

        and poured oil on it.

035:015 Jacob called the name of the place where God spoke with him "Bethel."

035:016 They traveled from Bethel.  There was still some distance

        to come to Ephrath, and Rachel travailed.  She had hard labor.

035:017 When she was in hard labor, the midwife said to her,

        "Don't be afraid, for now you will have another son."

035:018 It happened, as her soul was departing (for she died),

        that she named him Benoni,{"Benoni" means "son of my

        trouble."} but his father named him Benjamin.{"Benjamin"

        means "son of my right hand."}

035:019 Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath

        (the same is Bethlehem).

035:020 Jacob set up a pillar on her grave.  The same is the Pillar

        of Rachel's grave to this day.

035:021 Israel traveled, and spread his tent beyond the tower of Eder.

035:022 It happened, while Israel lived in that land, that Reuben went and

        lay with Bilhah, his father's concubine, and Israel heard of it.

        Now the sons of Jacob were twelve.

035:023 The sons of Leah:  Reuben (Jacob's firstborn),

        Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun.

035:024 The sons of Rachel:  Joseph and Benjamin.

035:025 The sons of Bilhah (Rachel's handmaid):  Dan and Naphtali.

035:026 The sons of Zilpah (Leah's handmaid):  Gad and Asher.

        These are the sons of Jacob, who were born to him in Paddan Aram.

035:027 Jacob came to Isaac his father, to Mamre, to Kiriath Arba

        (which is Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac lived as foreigners.

035:028 The days of Isaac were one hundred eighty years.

035:029 Isaac gave up the spirit, and died, and was gathered to his people,

        old and full of days.  Esau and Jacob, his sons, buried him.

036:001 Now this is the history of the generations of Esau

        (that is, Edom).

036:002 Esau took his wives from the daughters of Canaan:  Adah the daughter

        of Elon, the Hittite; and Oholibamah the daughter of Anah,

        the daughter of Zibeon, the Hivite;

036:003 and Basemath, Ishmael's daughter, sister of Nebaioth.

036:004 Adah bore to Esau Eliphaz.  Basemath bore Reuel.

036:005 Oholibamah bore Jeush, Jalam, and Korah.  These are the sons

        of Esau, who were born to him in the land of Canaan.

036:006 Esau took his wives, his sons, his daughters, and all the members

        of his household, with his livestock, all his animals, and all

        his possessions, which he had gathered in the land of Canaan,

        and went into a land away from his brother Jacob.

036:007 For their substance was too great for them to dwell together,

        and the land of their travels couldn't bear them because

        of their livestock.

036:008 Esau lived in the hill country of Seir.  Esau is Edom.

036:009 This is the history of the generations of Esau the father

        of the Edomites in the hill country of Seir:

036:010 these are the names of Esau's sons:  Eliphaz, the son

        of Adah, the wife of Esau; and Reuel, the son of Basemath,

        the wife of Esau.

036:011 The sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, and Gatam, and Kenaz.

036:012 Timna was concubine to Eliphaz, Esau's son; and she bore

        to Eliphaz Amalek.  These are the sons of Adah, Esau's wife.

036:013 These are the sons of Reuel:  Nahath, Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah.

        These were the sons of Basemath, Esau's wife.

036:014 These were the sons of Oholibamah, the daughter of Anah,

        the daughter of Zibeon, Esau's wife:  she bore to

        Esau Jeush, Jalam, and Korah.

036:015 These are the chiefs of the sons of Esau:  the sons of

        Eliphaz the firstborn of Esau:  chief Teman, chief Omar,

        chief Zepho, chief Kenaz,

036:016 chief Korah, chief Gatam, chief Amalek:  these are the chiefs

        who came of Eliphaz in the land of Edom; these are the

        sons of Adah.

036:017 These are the sons of Reuel, Esau's son:

        chief Nahath, chief Zerah, chief Shammah, chief Mizzah:

        these are the chiefs who came of Reuel in the land of Edom;

        these are the sons of Basemath, Esau's wife.

036:018 These are the sons of Oholibamah, Esau's wife:  chief Jeush,

        chief Jalam, chief Korah:  these are the chiefs who came

        of Oholibamah the daughter of Anah, Esau's wife.

036:019 These are the sons of Esau (that is, Edom), and these

        are their chiefs.

036:020 These are the sons of Seir the Horite, the inhabitants of the land:

        Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah,

036:021 Dishon, Ezer, and Dishan.  These are the chiefs who came

        of the Horites, the children of Seir in the land of Edom.

036:022 The children of Lotan were Hori and Heman.  Lotan's sister was Timna.

036:023 These are the children of Shobal:  Alvan, Manahath, Ebal, Shepho,

        and Onam.

036:024 These are the children of Zibeon:  Aiah and Anah.

        This is Anah who found the hot springs in the wilderness,

        as he fed the donkeys of Zibeon his father.

036:025 These are the children of Anah:  Dishon and Oholibamah,

        the daughter of Anah.

036:026 These are the children of Dishon:  Hemdan, Eshban, Ithran,

        and Cheran.

036:027 These are the children of Ezer:  Bilhan, Zaavan, and Akan.

036:028 These are the children of Dishan:  Uz and Aran.

036:029 These are the chiefs who came of the Horites:  chief Lotan,

        chief Shobal, chief Zibeon, chief Anah,

036:030 chief Dishon, chief Ezer, and chief Dishan:  these are

        the chiefs who came of the Horites, according to their chiefs

        in the land of Seir.

036:031 These are the kings who reigned in the land of Edom,

        before any king reigned over the children of Israel.

036:032 Bela, the son of Beor, reigned in Edom.  The name of his

        city was Dinhabah.

036:033 Bela died, and Jobab, the son of Zerah of Bozrah,

        reigned in his place.

036:034 Jobab died, and Husham of the land of the Temanites reigned

        in his place.

036:035 Husham died, and Hadad, the son of Bedad, who struck

        Midian in the field of Moab, reigned in his place.

        The name of his city was Avith.

036:036 Hadad died, and Samlah of Masrekah reigned in his place.

036:037 Samlah died, and Shaul of Rehoboth by the river,

        reigned in his place.

036:038 Shaul died, and Baal Hanan, the son of Achbor reigned

        in his place.

036:039 Baal Hanan the son of Achbor died, and Hadar reigned in his place.

        The name of his city was Pau.  His wife's name was Mehetabel,

        the daughter of Matred, the daughter of Mezahab.

036:040 These are the names of the chiefs who came from Esau, according to

        their families, after their places, and by their names:

        chief Timna, chief Alvah, chief Jetheth,

036:041 chief Oholibamah, chief Elah, chief Pinon,

036:042 chief Kenaz, chief Teman, chief Mibzar,

036:043 chief Magdiel, and chief Iram.  These are the chiefs of Edom,

        according to their habitations in the land of their possession.

        This is Esau, the father of the Edomites.

037:001 Jacob lived in the land of his father's travels, in the

        land of Canaan.

037:002 This is the history of the generations of Jacob.  Joseph, being

        seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his brothers.

        He was a boy with the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah, his father's wives.

        Joseph brought an evil report of them to their father.

037:003 Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children,

        because he was the son of his old age, and he made him a coat

        of many colors.

037:004 His brothers saw that their father loved him more than

        all his brothers, and they hated him, and couldn't speak

        peaceably to him.

037:005 Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it to his brothers,

        and they hated him all the more.

037:006 He said to them, "Please hear this dream which I have dreamed:

037:007 for behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and behold,

        my sheaf arose and also stood upright; and behold, your sheaves

        came around, and bowed down to my sheaf."

037:008 His brothers said to him, "Will you indeed reign over us?

        Or will you indeed have dominion over us?"  They hated him

        all the more for his dreams and for his words.

037:009 He dreamed yet another dream, and told it to his brothers,

        and said, "Behold, I have dreamed yet another dream:

        and behold, the sun and the moon and eleven stars bowed

        down to me."

037:010 He told it to his father and to his brothers.  His father rebuked him,

        and said to him, "What is this dream that you have dreamed?

        Will I and your mother and your brothers indeed come to bow

        ourselves down to you to the earth?"

037:011 His brothers envied him, but his father kept this saying in mind.

037:012 His brothers went to feed their father's flock in Shechem.

037:013 Israel said to Joseph, "Aren't your brothers feeding

        the flock in Shechem?  Come, and I will send you to them."

        He said to him, "Here I am."

037:014 He said to him, "Go now, see whether it is well with your brothers,

        and well with the flock; and bring me word again."

        So he sent him out of the valley of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.

037:015 A certain man found him, and behold, he was wandering in the field.

        The man asked him, "What are you looking for?"

037:016 He said, "I am looking for my brothers.  Tell me, please,

        where they are feeding the flock."

037:017 The man said, "They have left here, for I heard them say,

        'Let us go to Dothan.'"  Joseph went after his brothers,

        and found them in Dothan.

037:018 They saw him afar off, and before he came near to them,

        they conspired against him to kill him.

037:019 They said one to another, "Behold, this dreamer comes.

037:020 Come now therefore, and let's kill him, and cast him into one

        of the pits, and we will say, 'An evil animal has devoured him.'

        We will see what will become of his dreams."

037:021 Reuben heard it, and delivered him out of their hand, and said,

        "Let's not take his life."

037:022 Reuben said to them, "Shed no blood.  Throw him into this

        pit that is in the wilderness, but lay no hand on him"--

        that he might deliver him out of their hand, to restore him

        to his father.

037:023 It happened, when Joseph came to his brothers, that they stripped

        Joseph of his coat, the coat of many colors that was on him;

037:024 and they took him, and threw him into the pit.  The pit was empty.

        There was no water in it.

037:025 They sat down to eat bread, and they lifted up their eyes and looked,

        and saw a caravan of Ishmaelites was coming from Gilead,

        with their camels bearing spices and balm and myrrh,

        going to carry it down to Egypt.

037:026 Judah said to his brothers, "What profit is it if we kill

        our brother and conceal his blood?

037:027 Come, and let's sell him to the Ishmaelites, and not let

        our hand be on him; for he is our brother, our flesh."

        His brothers listened to him.

037:028 Midianites who were merchants passed by, and they drew and lifted

        up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites

        for twenty pieces of silver.  They brought Joseph into Egypt.

037:029 Reuben returned to the pit; and saw that Joseph wasn't in the pit;

        and he tore his clothes.

037:030 He returned to his brothers, and said, "The child is no more;

        and I, where will I go?"

037:031 They took Joseph's coat, and killed a male goat, and dipped

        the coat in the blood.

037:032 They took the coat of many colors, and they brought

        it to their father, and said, "We have found this.

        Examine it, now, whether it is your son's coat or not."

037:033 He recognized it, and said, "It is my son's coat.

        An evil animal has devoured him.  Joseph is without doubt

        torn in pieces."

037:034 Jacob tore his clothes, and put sackcloth on his waist,

        and mourned for his son many days.

037:035 All his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him,

        but he refused to be comforted.  He said, "For I will go down

        to Sheol{Sheol is the place of the dead.} to my son mourning."

        His father wept for him.

037:036 The Midianites sold him into Egypt to Potiphar, an officer

        of Pharaoh's, the captain of the guard.

038:001 It happened at that time, that Judah went down from his brothers,

        and visited a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah.

038:002 Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite whose name

        was Shua.  He took her, and went in to her.

038:003 She conceived, and bore a son; and he named him Er.

038:004 She conceived again, and bore a son; and she named him Onan.

038:005 She yet again bore a son, and named him Shelah:

        and he was at Chezib, when she bore him.

038:006 Judah took a wife for Er, his firstborn, and her name was Tamar.

038:007 Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of Yahweh.

        Yahweh killed him.

038:008 Judah said to Onan, "Go in to your brother's wife, and perform

        the duty of a husband's brother to her, and raise up seed

        to your brother."

038:009 Onan knew that the seed wouldn't be his; and it happened,

        when he went in to his brother's wife, that he spilled it

        on the ground, lest he should give seed to his brother.

038:010 The thing which he did was evil in the sight of Yahweh,

        and he killed him also.

038:011 Then Judah said to Tamar, his daughter-in-law, "Remain a widow

        in your father's house, until Shelah, my son, is grown up;"

        for he said, "Lest he also die, like his brothers."

        Tamar went and lived in her father's house.

038:012 After many days, Shua's daughter, the wife of Judah, died.

        Judah was comforted, and went up to his sheepshearers to Timnah,

        he and his friend Hirah, the Adullamite.

038:013 It was told Tamar, saying, "Behold, your father-in-law is going

        up to Timnah to shear his sheep."

038:014 She took off of her the garments of her widowhood,

        and covered herself with her veil, and wrapped herself,

        and sat in the gate of Enaim, which is by the way to Timnah;

        for she saw that Shelah was grown up, and she wasn't given

        to him as a wife.

038:015 When Judah saw her, he thought that she was a prostitute,

        for she had covered her face.

038:016 He turned to her by the way, and said, "Please come,

        let me come in to you," for he didn't know that she was

        his daughter-in-law. She said, "What will you give me,

        that you may come in to me?"

038:017 He said, "I will send you a kid of the goats from the flock."

        She said, "Will you give me a pledge, until you send it?"

038:018 He said, "What pledge will I give you?"  She said, "Your signet

        and your cord, and your staff that is in your hand."

        He gave them to her, and came in to her, and she conceived by him.

038:019 She arose, and went away, and put off her veil from her,

        and put on the garments of her widowhood.

038:020 Judah sent the kid of the goats by the hand of his friend,

        the Adullamite, to receive the pledge from the woman's hand,

        but he didn't find her.

038:021 Then he asked the men of her place, saying, "Where is

        the prostitute, that was at Enaim by the road?"  They said,

        "There has been no prostitute here."

038:022 He returned to Judah, and said, "I haven't found her;

        and also the men of the place said, 'There has been

        no prostitute here.'"

038:023 Judah said, "Let her keep it, lest we be shamed.  Behold, I sent

        this kid, and you haven't found her."

038:024 It happened about three months later, that it was told Judah,

        saying, "Tamar, your daughter-in-law, has played the prostitute;

        and moreover, behold, she is with child by prostitution."

        Judah said, "Bring her forth, and let her be burnt."

038:025 When she was brought forth, she sent to her father-in-law,

        saying, "By the man, whose these are, I am with child."

        She also said, "Please discern whose are these--the signet,

        and the cords, and the staff."

038:026 Judah acknowledged them, and said, "She is more righteous

        than I, because I didn't give her to Shelah, my son."

        He knew her again no more.

038:027 It happened in the time of her travail, that behold,

        twins were in her womb.

038:028 When she travailed, one put out a hand, and the midwife took and tied

        a scarlet thread on his hand, saying, "This came out first."

038:029 It happened, as he drew back his hand, that behold, his brother

        came out, and she said, "Why have you made a breach for yourself?"

        Therefore his name was called Perez.{Perez means "breaking out."}

038:030 Afterward his brother came out, that had the scarlet

        thread on his hand, and his name was called Zerah.{Zerah

        means "scarlet" or "brightness."}

039:001 Joseph was brought down to Egypt.  Potiphar, an officer

        of Pharaoh's, the captain of the guard, an Egyptian,

        bought him from the hand of the Ishmaelites that had brought

        him down there.

039:002 Yahweh was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man.

        He was in the house of his master the Egyptian.

039:003 His master saw that Yahweh was with him, and that Yahweh made

        all that he did prosper in his hand.

039:004 Joseph found favor in his sight.  He ministered to him,

        and he made him overseer over his house, and all that he had

        he put into his hand.

039:005 It happened from the time that he made him overseer in his house,

        and over all that he had, that Yahweh blessed the Egyptian's

        house for Joseph's sake; and the blessing of Yahweh was on

        all that he had, in the house and in the field.

039:006 He left all that he had in Joseph's hand.  He didn't concern

        himself with anything, except for the food which he ate.

        Joseph was well-built and handsome.

039:007 It happened after these things, that his master's wife cast

        her eyes on Joseph; and she said, "Lie with me."

039:008 But he refused, and said to his master's wife, "Behold, my master

        doesn't know what is with me in the house, and he has put

        all that he has into my hand.

039:009 He isn't greater in this house than I, neither has he kept

        back anything from me but you, because you are his wife.

        How then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?"

039:010 As she spoke to Joseph day by day, he didn't listen to her,

        to lie by her, or to be with her.

039:011 About this time, he went into the house to do his work,

        and there were none of the men of the house inside.

039:012 She caught him by his garment, saying, "Lie with me!"

        He left his garment in her hand, and ran outside.

039:013 When she saw that he had left his garment in her hand,

        and had run outside,

039:014 she called to the men of her house, and spoke to them,

        saying, "Behold, he has brought in a Hebrew to us to mock us.

        He came in to me to lie with me, and I cried with a loud voice.

039:015 It happened, when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried,

        that he left his garment by me, and ran outside."

039:016 She laid up his garment by her, until his master came home.

039:017 She spoke to him according to these words, saying, "The Hebrew

        servant, whom you have brought to us, came in to me to mock me,

039:018 and it happened, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that he left

        his garment by me, and ran outside."

039:019 It happened, when his master heard the words of his wife,

        which she spoke to him, saying, "This is what your servant

        did to me," that his wrath was kindled.

039:020 Joseph's master took him, and put him into the prison,

        the place where the king's prisoners were bound, and he was

        there in custody.

039:021 But Yahweh was with Joseph, and showed kindness to him,

        and gave him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison.

039:022 The keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all

        the prisoners who were in the prison.  Whatever they did there,

        he was responsible for it.

039:023 The keeper of the prison didn't look after anything that was under

        his hand, because Yahweh was with him; and that which he did,

        Yahweh made it prosper.

040:001 It happened after these things, that the butler of the king

        of Egypt and his baker offended their lord, the king of Egypt.

040:002 Pharaoh was angry with his two officers, the chief cupbearer

        and the chief baker.

040:003 He put them in custody in the house of the captain of the guard,

        into the prison, the place where Joseph was bound.

040:004 The captain of the guard assigned them to Joseph, and he took

        care of them.  They stayed in prison many days.

040:005 They both dreamed a dream, each man his dream, in one night,

        each man according to the interpretation of his dream,

        the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were

        bound in the prison.

040:006 Joseph came in to them in the morning, and saw them, and saw

        that they were sad.

040:007 He asked Pharaoh's officers who were with him in custody in his

        master's house, saying, "Why do you look so sad today?"

040:008 They said to him, "We have dreamed a dream, and there

        is no one who can interpret it."  Joseph said to them,

        "Don't interpretations belong to God?  Please tell it to me."

040:009 The chief cupbearer told his dream to Joseph, and said to him,

        "In my dream, behold, a vine was in front of me,

040:010 and in the vine were three branches.  It was as though it budded,

        its blossoms shot forth, and the clusters of it brought

        forth ripe grapes.

040:011 Pharaoh's cup was in my hand; and I took the grapes,

        and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup

        into Pharaoh's hand."

040:012 Joseph said to him, "This is the interpretation of it:

        the three branches are three days.

040:013 Within three more days, Pharaoh will lift up your head,

        and restore you to your office.  You will give Pharaoh's cup

        into his hand, the way you did when you were his cupbearer.

040:014 But remember me when it will be well with you, and show

        kindness, please, to me, and make mention of me to Pharaoh,

        and bring me out of this house.

040:015 For indeed, I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews,

        and here also have I done nothing that they should put me

        into the dungeon."

040:016 When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good,

        he said to Joseph, "I also was in my dream, and behold,

        three baskets of white bread were on my head.

040:017 In the uppermost basket there was all kinds of baked food

        for Pharaoh, and the birds ate them out of the basket

        on my head."

040:018 Joseph answered, "This is the interpretation of it.

        The three baskets are three days.

040:019 Within three more days, Pharaoh will lift up your head from

        off you, and will hang you on a tree; and the birds will eat

        your flesh from off you."

040:020 It happened the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday,

        that he made a feast for all his servants, and he lifted up

        the head of the chief cupbearer and the head of the chief

        baker among his servants.

040:021 He restored the chief cupbearer to his position again,

        and he gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand;

040:022 but he hanged the chief baker, as Joseph had interpreted to them.

040:023 Yet the chief cupbearer didn't remember Joseph, but forgot him.

041:001 It happened at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed:

        and behold, he stood by the river.

041:002 Behold, there came up out of the river seven cattle, sleek and fat,

        and they fed in the marsh grass.

041:003 Behold, seven other cattle came up after them out of the river,

        ugly and thin, and stood by the other cattle on the brink

        of the river.

041:004 The ugly and thin cattle ate up the seven sleek and fat cattle.

        So Pharaoh awoke.

041:005 He slept and dreamed a second time:  and behold, seven heads

        of grain came up on one stalk, healthy and good.

041:006 Behold, seven heads of grain, thin and blasted with the east wind,

        sprung up after them.

041:007 The thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven healthy and full ears.

        Pharaoh awoke, and behold, it was a dream.

041:008 It happened in the morning that his spirit was troubled,

        and he sent and called for all of Egypt's magicians and wise men.

        Pharaoh told them his dreams, but there was no one who could

        interpret them to Pharaoh.

041:009 Then the chief cupbearer spoke to Pharaoh, saying, "I remember

        my faults today.

041:010 Pharaoh was angry with his servants, and put me in custody in

        the house of the captain of the guard, me and the chief baker.

041:011 We dreamed a dream in one night, I and he.  We dreamed each man

        according to the interpretation of his dream.

041:012 There was with us there a young man, a Hebrew, servant to the captain

        of the guard, and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams.

        To each man according to his dream he interpreted.

041:013 It happened, as he interpreted to us, so it was:

        he restored me to my office, and he hanged him."

041:014 Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily

        out of the dungeon.  He shaved himself, changed his clothing,

        and came in to Pharaoh.

041:015 Pharaoh said to Joseph, "I have dreamed a dream, and there

        is no one who can interpret it.  I have heard it said of you,

        that when you hear a dream you can interpret it."

041:016 Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, "It isn't in me.

        God will give Pharaoh an answer of peace."

041:017 Pharaoh spoke to Joseph, "In my dream, behold, I stood on

        the brink of the river:

041:018 and behold, there came up out of the river seven cattle,

        fat and sleek.  They fed in the marsh grass,

041:019 and behold, seven other cattle came up after them, poor and

        very ugly and thin, such as I never saw in all the land

        of Egypt for ugliness.

041:020 The thin and ugly cattle ate up the first seven fat cattle,

041:021 and when they had eaten them up, it couldn't be known that they

        had eaten them, but they were still ugly, as at the beginning.

        So I awoke.

041:022 I saw in my dream, and behold, seven heads of grain came up

        on one stalk, full and good:

041:023 and behold, seven heads of grain, withered, thin, and blasted

        with the east wind, sprung up after them.

041:024 The thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven good heads of grain.

        I told it to the magicians, but there was no one who could

        explain it to me."

041:025 Joseph said to Pharaoh, "The dream of Pharaoh is one.

        What God is about to do he has declared to Pharaoh.

041:026 The seven good cattle are seven years; and the seven good heads

        of grain are seven years.  The dream is one.

041:027 The seven thin and ugly cattle that came up after them are

        seven years, and also the seven empty heads of grain blasted

        with the east wind; they will be seven years of famine.

041:028 That is the thing which I spoke to Pharaoh.  What God is about

        to do he has shown to Pharaoh.

041:029 Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout

        all the land of Egypt.

041:030 There will arise after them seven years of famine,

        and all the plenty will be forgotten in the land of Egypt.

        The famine will consume the land,

041:031 and the plenty will not be known in the land by reason of that

        famine which follows; for it will be very grievous.

041:032 The dream was doubled to Pharaoh, because the thing is established

        by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.

041:033 "Now therefore let Pharaoh look for a discreet and wise man,

        and set him over the land of Egypt.

041:034 Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint overseers over the land,

        and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt's produce

        in the seven plenteous years.

041:035 Let them gather all the food of these good years that come,

        and lay up grain under the hand of Pharaoh for food in the cities,

        and let them keep it.

041:036 The food will be for a store to the land against the seven

        years of famine, which will be in the land of Egypt;

        that the land not perish through the famine."

041:037 The thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes

        of all his servants.

041:038 Pharaoh said to his servants, "Can we find such a one as this,

        a man in whom is the Spirit of God?"

041:039 Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Because God has shown you all of this,

        there is none so discreet and wise as you.

041:040 You shall be over my house, and according to your word

        will all my people be ruled.  Only in the throne I will be

        greater than you."

041:041 Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Behold, I have set you over all

        the land of Egypt."

041:042 Pharaoh took off his signet ring from his hand, and put it

        on Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in robes of fine linen,

        and put a gold chain about his neck,

041:043 and he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had.

        They cried before him, "Bow the knee!"  He set him over all

        the land of Egypt.

041:044 Pharaoh said to Joseph, "I am Pharaoh, and without you shall

        no man lift up his hand or his foot in all the land of Egypt."

041:045 Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphenath-Paneah; and he gave

        him Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera priest of On as a wife.

        Joseph went out over the land of Egypt.

041:046 Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh king

        of Egypt.  Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh,

        and went throughout all the land of Egypt.

041:047 In the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth abundantly.

041:048 He gathered up all the food of the seven years which were

        in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities:

        the food of the field, which was round about every city,

        he laid up in the same.

041:049 Joseph laid up grain as the sand of the sea, very much,

        until he stopped counting, for it was without number.

041:050 To Joseph were born two sons before the year of famine came,

        whom Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera priest of On,

        bore to him.

041:051 Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh,{"Manasseh"

        sounds like the Hebrew for "forget."} "For," he said, "God has

        made me forget all my toil, and all my father's house."

041:052 The name of the second, he called Ephraim{"Ephraim"

        sounds like the Hebrew for "twice fruitful."}: "For God has

        made me fruitful in the land of my affliction."

041:053 The seven years of plenty, that were in the land of Egypt,

        came to an end.

041:054 The seven years of famine began to come, just as Joseph had said.

        There was famine in all lands, but in all the land of Egypt

        there was bread.

041:055 When all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh

        for bread, and Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, "Go to Joseph.

        What he says to you, do."

041:056 The famine was over all the surface of the earth.

        Joseph opened all the store houses, and sold to the Egyptians.

        The famine was severe in the land of Egypt.

041:057 All countries came into Egypt, to Joseph, to buy grain,

        because the famine was severe in all the earth.

042:001 Now Jacob saw that there was grain in Egypt, and Jacob said

        to his sons, "Why do you look at one another?"

042:002 He said, "Behold, I have heard that there is grain in Egypt.

        Go down there, and buy for us from there, so that we may live,

        and not die."

042:003 Joseph's ten brothers went down to buy grain from Egypt.

042:004 But Jacob didn't send Benjamin, Joseph's brother, with his brothers;

        for he said, "Lest perhaps harm happen to him."

042:005 The sons of Israel came to buy among those who came,

        for the famine was in the land of Canaan.

042:006 Joseph was the governor over the land.  It was he who sold

        to all the people of the land.  Joseph's brothers came,

        and bowed themselves down to him with their faces to the earth.

042:007 Joseph saw his brothers, and he recognized them, but acted

        like a stranger to them, and spoke roughly with them.

        He said to them, "Where did you come from?"  They said,

        "From the land of Canaan to buy food."

042:008 Joseph recognized his brothers, but they didn't recognize him.

042:009 Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed about them,

        and said to them, "You are spies!  You have come to see

        the nakedness of the land."

042:010 They said to him, "No, my lord, but your servants have come

        to buy food.

042:011 We are all one man's sons; we are honest men.  Your servants

        are not spies."

042:012 He said to them, "No, but you have come to see the nakedness

        of the land."

042:013 They said, "We, your servants, are twelve brothers, the sons

        of one man in the land of Canaan; and behold, the youngest

        is this day with our father, and one is no more."

042:014 Joseph said to them, "It is like I told you, saying, 'You are spies.'

042:015 By this you shall be tested.  By the life of Pharaoh,

        you shall not go forth from here, unless your youngest

        brother comes here.

042:016 Send one of you, and let him get your brother, and you shall be bound,

        that your words may be tested, whether there is truth in you,

        or else by the life of Pharaoh surely you are spies."

042:017 He put them all together into custody for three days.

042:018 Joseph said to them the third day, "Do this, and live,

        for I fear God.

042:019 If you are honest men, then let one of your brothers be bound

        in your prison; but you go, carry grain for the famine

        of your houses.

042:020 Bring your youngest brother to me; so will your words be verified,

        and you won't die."  They did so.

042:021 They said one to another, "We are certainly guilty concerning

        our brother, in that we saw the distress of his soul,

        when he begged us, and we wouldn't listen.  Therefore this

        distress has come upon us."

042:022 Reuben answered them, saying, "Didn't I tell you, saying,

        'Don't sin against the child,' and you wouldn't listen?

        Therefore also, behold, his blood is required."

042:023 They didn't know that Joseph understood them; for there was

        an interpreter between them.

042:024 He turned himself away from them, and wept.  Then he returned

        to them, and spoke to them, and took Simeon from among them,

        and bound him before their eyes.

042:025 Then Joseph gave a command to fill their bags with grain,

        and to restore every man's money into his sack, and to give

        them food for the way.  So it was done to them.

042:026 They loaded their donkeys with their grain, and departed from there.

042:027 As one of them opened his sack to give his donkey food in the

        lodging place, he saw his money.  Behold, it was in the mouth

        of his sack.

042:028 He said to his brothers, "My money is restored!  Behold, it is

        in my sack!"  Their hearts failed them, and they turned

        trembling one to another, saying, "What is this that God has

        done to us?"

042:029 They came to Jacob their father, to the land of Canaan,

        and told him all that had happened to them, saying,

042:030 "The man, the lord of the land, spoke roughly with us,

        and took us for spies of the country.

042:031 We said to him, 'We are honest men.  We are no spies.

042:032 We are twelve brothers, sons of our father; one is no more,

        and the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan.'

042:033 The man, the lord of the land, said to us, 'By this I will know

        that you are honest men:  leave one of your brothers with me,

        and take grain for the famine of your houses, and go your way.

042:034 Bring your youngest brother to me.  Then I will know

        that you are not spies, but that you are honest men.

        So I will deliver your brother to you, and you shall trade

        in the land.'"

042:035 It happened as they emptied their sacks, that behold, every man's

        bundle of money was in his sack.  When they and their father

        saw their bundles of money, they were afraid.

042:036 Jacob, their father, said to them, "You have bereaved me

        of my children!  Joseph is no more, Simeon is no more,

        and you want to take Benjamin away.  All these things

        are against me."

042:037 Reuben spoke to his father, saying, "Kill my two sons,

        if I don't bring him to you.  Entrust him to my care,

        and I will bring him to you again."

042:038 He said, "My son shall not go down with you; for his brother

        is dead, and he only is left.  If harm happens to him along

        the way in which you go, then you will bring down my gray

        hairs with sorrow to Sheol."

043:001 The famine was severe in the land.

043:002 It happened, when they had eaten up the grain which they had

        brought out of Egypt, their father said to them, "Go again,

        buy us a little more food."

043:003 Judah spoke to him, saying, "The man solemnly warned us, saying,

        'You shall not see my face, unless your brother is with you.'

043:004 If you'll send our brother with us, we'll go down and buy you food,

043:005 but if you'll not send him, we'll not go down, for the man

        said to us, 'You shall not see my face, unless your brother

        is with you.'"

043:006 Israel said, "Why did you treat me so badly, telling the man

        that you had another brother?"

043:007 They said, "The man asked directly concerning ourselves,

        and concerning our relatives, saying, 'Is your father still alive?

        Have you another brother?'  We just answered his questions.

        Is there any way we could know that he would say,

        'Bring your brother down?'"

043:008 Judah said to Israel, his father, "Send the boy with me,

        and we'll get up and go, so that we may live, and not die,

        both we, and you, and also our little ones.

043:009 I'll be collateral for him.  From my hand will you require him.

        If I don't bring him to you, and set him before you,

        then let me bear the blame forever,

043:010 for if we hadn't delayed, surely we would have returned a second

        time by now."

043:011 Their father, Israel, said to them, "If it must be so, then do this.

        Take from the choice fruits of the land in your bags, and carry

        down a present for the man, a little balm, a little honey,

        spices and myrrh, nuts, and almonds;

043:012 and take double money in your hand, and take back

        the money that was returned in the mouth of your sacks.

        Perhaps it was an oversight.

043:013 Take your brother also, get up, and return to the man.

043:014 May God Almighty give you mercy before the man,

        that he may release to you your other brother and Benjamin.

        If I am bereaved of my children, I am bereaved."

043:015 The men took that present, and they took double money in

        their hand, and Benjamin; and got up, went down to Egypt,

        and stood before Joseph.

043:016 When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the steward of

        his house, "Bring the men into the house, and butcher an animal,

        and make ready; for the men will dine with me at noon."

043:017 The man did as Joseph commanded, and the man brought the men

        to Joseph's house.

043:018 The men were afraid, because they were brought to Joseph's house;

        and they said, "Because of the money that was returned in our

        sacks at the first time, we're brought in; that he may seek

        occasion against us, attack us, and seize us as slaves,

        along with our donkeys."

043:019 They came near to the steward of Joseph's house, and they

        spoke to him at the door of the house,

043:020 and said, "Oh, my lord, we indeed came down the first time

        to buy food.

043:021 When we came to the lodging place, we opened our sacks,

        and behold, every man's money was in the mouth of his sack,

        our money in full weight.  We have brought it back in our hand.

043:022 We have brought down other money in our hand to buy food.

        We don't know who put our money in our sacks."

043:023 He said, "Peace be to you.  Don't be afraid.  Your God,

        and the God of your father, has given you treasure in your sacks.

        I received your money."  He brought Simeon out to them.

043:024 The man brought the men into Joseph's house, and gave them water,

        and they washed their feet.  He gave their donkeys fodder.

043:025 They made ready the present for Joseph's coming at noon,

        for they heard that they should eat bread there.

043:026 When Joseph came home, they brought him the present which was

        in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves down to him

        to the earth.

043:027 He asked them of their welfare, and said, "Is your father well,

        the old man of whom you spoke?  Is he yet alive?"

043:028 They said, "Your servant, our father, is well.  He is still alive."

        They bowed the head, and did homage.

043:029 He lifted up his eyes, and saw Benjamin, his brother,

        his mother's son, and said, "Is this your youngest brother,

        of whom you spoke to me?"  He said, "God be gracious

        to you, my son."

043:030 Joseph hurried, for his heart yearned over his brother;

        and he sought a place to weep.  He entered into his room,

        and wept there.

043:031 He washed his face, and came out.  He controlled himself,

        and said, "Serve the meal."

043:032 They served him by himself, and them by themselves,

        and the Egyptians, that ate with him, by themselves,

        because the Egyptians don't eat bread with the Hebrews,

        for that is an abomination to the Egyptians.

043:033 They sat before him, the firstborn according to his birthright,

        and the youngest according to his youth, and the men marveled

        one with another.

043:034 He sent portions to them from before him, but Benjamin's

        portion was five times as much as any of theirs.

        They drank, and were merry with him.

044:001 He commanded the steward of his house, saying, "Fill the men's

        sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put every

        man's money in his sack's mouth.

044:002 Put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of the youngest,

        with his grain money."  He did according to the word that

        Joseph had spoken.

044:003 As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away,

        they and their donkeys.

044:004 When they had gone out of the city, and were not yet far off,

        Joseph said to his steward, "Up, follow after the men.

        When you overtake them, ask them, 'Why have you rewarded

        evil for good?

044:005 Isn't this that from which my lord drinks, and by which

        he indeed divines?  You have done evil in so doing.'"

044:006 He overtook them, and he spoke these words to them.

044:007 They said to him, "Why does my lord speak such words as these?

        Far be it from your servants that they should do such a thing!

044:008 Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we brought

        again to you out of the land of Canaan.  How then should we

        steal silver or gold out of your lord's house?

044:009 With whoever of your servants it be found, let him die,

        and we also will be my lord's bondservants."

044:010 He said, "Now also let it be according to your words:

        he with whom it is found will be my bondservant; and you

        will be blameless."

044:011 Then they hurried, and every man took his sack down to the ground,

        and every man opened his sack.

044:012 He searched, beginning with the eldest, and ending at the youngest.

        The cup was found in Benjamin's sack.

044:013 Then they tore their clothes, and every man loaded his donkey,

        and returned to the city.

044:014 Judah and his brothers came to Joseph's house, and he was

        still there.  They fell on the ground before him.

044:015 Joseph said to them, "What deed is this that you have done?

        Don't you know that such a man as I can indeed divine?"

044:016 Judah said, "What will we tell my lord?  What will we speak?

        Or how will we clear ourselves?  God has found out the iniquity

        of your servants.  Behold, we are my lord's bondservants,

        both we, and he also in whose hand the cup is found."

044:017 He said, "Far be it from me that I should do so.  The man

        in whose hand the cup is found, he will be my bondservant;

        but as for you, go up in peace to your father."

044:018 Then Judah came near to him, and said, "Oh, my lord,

        please let your servant speak a word in my lord's ears,

        and don't let your anger burn against your servant;

        for you are even as Pharaoh.

044:019 My lord asked his servants, saying, 'Have you a father,

        or a brother?'

044:020 We said to my lord, 'We have a father, an old man, and a child

        of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead,

        and he alone is left of his mother; and his father loves him.'

044:021 You said to your servants, 'Bring him down to me, that I may

        set my eyes on him.'

044:022 We said to my lord, 'The boy can't leave his father:

        for if he should leave his father, his father would die.'

044:023 You said to your servants, 'Unless your youngest brother comes

        down with you, you will see my face no more.'

044:024 It happened when we came up to your servant my father,

        we told him the words of my lord.

044:025 Our father said, 'Go again, buy us a little food.'

044:026 We said, 'We can't go down.  If our youngest brother is with us,

        then we will go down:  for we may not see the man's face,

        unless our youngest brother is with us.'

044:027 Your servant, my father, said to us, 'You know that my wife

        bore me two sons:

044:028 and the one went out from me, and I said, "Surely he is torn

        in pieces;" and I haven't seen him since.

044:029 If you take this one also from me, and harm happens to him,

        you will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to Sheol.'

044:030 Now therefore when I come to your servant my father,

        and the boy is not with us; seeing that his life is bound up

        in the boy's life;

044:031 it will happen, when he sees that the boy is no more,

        that he will die.  Your servants will bring down the gray

        hairs of your servant, our father, with sorrow to Sheol.

044:032 For your servant became collateral for the boy to my father,

        saying, 'If I don't bring him to you, then I will bear

        the blame to my father forever.'

044:033 Now therefore, please let your servant stay instead of the boy,

        a bondservant to my lord; and let the boy go up with his brothers.

044:034 For how will I go up to my father, if the boy isn't with me?--

        lest I see the evil that will come on my father."

045:001 Then Joseph couldn't control himself before all those who stood

        before him, and he cried, "Cause every man to go out from me!"

        No one else stood with him, while Joseph made himself known

        to his brothers.

045:002 He wept aloud.  The Egyptians heard, and the house of Pharaoh heard.

045:003 Joseph said to his brothers, "I am Joseph!  Does my father

        still live?"  His brothers couldn't answer him; for they

        were terrified at his presence.

045:004 Joseph said to his brothers, "Come near to me, please."

        They came near.  "He said, I am Joseph, your brother,

        whom you sold into Egypt.

045:005 Now don't be grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that you sold

        me here, for God sent me before you to preserve life.

045:006 For these two years the famine has been in the land,

        and there are yet five years, in which there will be neither

        plowing nor harvest.

045:007 God sent me before you to preserve for you a remnant in the earth,

        and to save you alive by a great deliverance.

045:008 So now it wasn't you who sent me here, but God, and he has

        made me a father to Pharaoh, lord of all his house, and ruler

        over all the land of Egypt.

045:009 Hurry, and go up to my father, and tell him, 'This is what

        your son Joseph says, "God has made me lord of all Egypt.

        Come down to me.  Don't wait.

045:010 You shall dwell in the land of Goshen, and you will be near

        to me, you, your children, your children's children, your flocks,

        your herds, and all that you have.

045:011 There I will nourish you; for there are yet five years of famine;

        lest you come to poverty, you, and your household, and all

        that you have."'

045:012 Behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin,

        that it is my mouth that speaks to you.

045:013 You shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt,

        and of all that you have seen.  You shall hurry and bring

        my father down here."

045:014 He fell on his brother Benjamin's neck, and wept, and Benjamin

        wept on his neck.

045:015 He kissed all his brothers, and wept on them.  After that his

        brothers talked with him.

045:016 The report of it was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying,

        "Joseph's brothers have come."  It pleased Pharaoh well,

        and his servants.

045:017 Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Tell your brothers, 'Do this.

        Load your animals, and go, travel to the land of Canaan.

045:018 Take your father and your households, and come to me,

        and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and you

        will eat the fat of the land.'

045:019 Now you are commanded:  do this.  Take wagons out of the land

        of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring

        your father, and come.

045:020 Also, don't concern yourselves about your belongings,

        for the good of all of the land of Egypt is yours."

045:021 The sons of Israel did so.  Joseph gave them wagons,

        according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them

        provision for the way.

045:022 He gave each one of them changes of clothing, but to Benjamin he gave

        three hundred pieces of silver and five changes of clothing.

045:023 To his father, he sent after this manner:  ten donkeys loaded

        with the good things of Egypt, and ten female donkeys loaded

        with grain and bread and provision for his father by the way.

045:024 So he sent his brothers away, and they departed.

        He said to them, "See that you don't quarrel on the way."

045:025 They went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan,

        to Jacob their father.

045:026 They told him, saying, "Joseph is still alive, and he is

        ruler over all the land of Egypt."  His heart fainted,

        for he didn't believe them.

045:027 They told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said to them.

        When he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him,

        the spirit of Jacob, their father, revived.

045:028 Israel said, "It is enough.  Joseph my son is still alive.

        I will go and see him before I die."

046:001 Israel traveled with all that he had, and came to Beersheba,

        and offered sacrifices to the God of his father, Isaac.

046:002 God spoke to Israel in the visions of the night, and said,

        "Jacob, Jacob!"  He said, "Here I am."

046:003 He said, "I am God, the God of your father.  Don't be afraid to go

        down into Egypt, for there I will make of you a great nation.

046:004 I will go down with you into Egypt.  I will also surely bring

        you up again.  Joseph will close your eyes."

046:005 Jacob rose up from Beersheba, and the sons of Israel carried Jacob,

        their father, their little ones, and their wives, in the wagons

        which Pharaoh had sent to carry him.

046:006 They took their livestock, and their goods, which they had gotten

        in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt--Jacob, and all

        his seed with him,

046:007 his sons, and his sons' sons with him, his daughters,

        and his sons' daughters, and he brought all his seed with

        him into Egypt.

046:008 These are the names of the children of Israel, who came

        into Egypt, Jacob and his sons:  Reuben, Jacob's firstborn.

046:009 The sons of Reuben:  Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi.

046:010 The sons of Simeon:  Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Shaul

        the son of a Canaanite woman.

046:011 The sons of Levi:  Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.

046:012 The sons of Judah:  Er, Onan, Shelah, Perez, and Zerah;

        but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan.  The sons of Perez

        were Hezron and Hamul.

046:013 The sons of Issachar:  Tola, Puvah, Iob, and Shimron.

046:014 The sons of Zebulun:  Sered, Elon, and Jahleel.

046:015 These are the sons of Leah, whom she bore to Jacob in Paddan Aram,

        with his daughter Dinah.  All the souls of his sons and his

        daughters were thirty-three.

046:016 The sons of Gad:  Ziphion, Haggi, Shuni, Ezbon, Eri, Arodi,

        and Areli.

046:017 The sons of Asher:  Imnah, Ishvah, Ishvi, Beriah, and Serah

        their sister.  The sons of Beriah:  Heber and Malchiel.

046:018 These are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah,

        his daughter, and these she bore to Jacob, even sixteen souls.

046:019 The sons of Rachel, Jacob's wife:  Joseph and Benjamin.

046:020 To Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim,

        whom Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera, priest of On,

        bore to him.

046:021 The sons of Benjamin:  Bela, Becher, Ashbel, Gera, Naaman,

        Ehi, Rosh, Muppim, Huppim, and Ard.

046:022 These are the sons of Rachel, who were born to Jacob:

        all the souls were fourteen.

046:023 The son of Dan:  Hushim.

046:024 The sons of Naphtali:  Jahzeel, Guni, Jezer, and Shillem.

046:025 These are the sons of Bilhah, whom Laban gave to Rachel, his daughter,

        and these she bore to Jacob:  all the souls were seven.

046:026 All the souls who came with Jacob into Egypt, who were his

        direct descendants, besides Jacob's sons' wives, all the

        souls were sixty-six.

046:027 The sons of Joseph, who were born to him in Egypt, were two souls.

        All the souls of the house of Jacob, who came into Egypt,

        were seventy.

046:028 He sent Judah before him to Joseph, to show the way before him

        to Goshen, and they came into the land of Goshen.

046:029 Joseph made ready his chariot, and went up to meet Israel,

        his father, in Goshen.  He presented himself to him,

        and fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while.

046:030 Israel said to Joseph, "Now let me die, since I have seen

        your face, that you are still alive."

046:031 Joseph said to his brothers, and to his father's house,

        "I will go up, and speak with Pharaoh, and will tell him,

        'My brothers, and my father's house, who were in the land

        of Canaan, have come to me.

046:032 These men are shepherds, for they have been keepers of livestock,

        and they have brought their flocks, and their herds,

        and all that they have.'

046:033 It will happen, when Pharaoh summons you, and will say,

        'What is your occupation?'

046:034 that you shall say, 'Your servants have been keepers of livestock

        from our youth even until now, both we, and our fathers:'

        that you may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd

        is an abomination to the Egyptians."

047:001 Then Joseph went in and told Pharaoh, and said, "My father

        and my brothers, with their flocks, their herds, and all that

        they own, have come out of the land of Canaan; and behold,

        they are in the land of Goshen."

047:002 From among his brothers he took five men, and presented

        them to Pharaoh.

047:003 Pharaoh said to his brothers, "What is your occupation?"

        They said to Pharaoh, "Your servants are shepherds, both we,

        and our fathers."

047:004 They said to Pharaoh, "We have come to live as foreigners in

        the land, for there is no pasture for your servants' flocks.

        For the famine is severe in the land of Canaan.  Now therefore,

        please let your servants dwell in the land of Goshen."

047:005 Pharaoh spoke to Joseph, saying, "Your father and your brothers

        have come to you.

047:006 The land of Egypt is before you.  Make your father and your

        brothers dwell in the best of the land.  Let them dwell

        in the land of Goshen.  If you know any able men among them,

        then put them in charge of my livestock."

047:007 Joseph brought in Jacob, his father, and set him before Pharaoh,

        and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.

047:008 Pharaoh said to Jacob, "How many are the days of the years

        of your life?"

047:009 Jacob said to Pharaoh, "The days of the years of my pilgrimage

        are one hundred thirty years.  Few and evil have been

        the days of the years of my life, and they have not attained

        to the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days

        of their pilgrimage."

047:010 Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from the presence of Pharaoh.

047:011 Joseph placed his father and his brothers, and gave them

        a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land,

        in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.

047:012 Joseph nourished his father, his brothers, and all of his

        father's household, with bread, according to their families.

047:013 There was no bread in all the land; for the famine was very severe,

        so that the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan fainted

        by reason of the famine.

047:014 Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt,

        and in the land of Canaan, for the grain which they bought:

        and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house.

047:015 When the money was all spent in the land of Egypt, and in

        the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came to Joseph, and said,

        "Give us bread, for why should we die in your presence?

        For our money fails."

047:016 Joseph said, "Give me your livestock; and I will give you food

        for your livestock, if your money is gone."

047:017 They brought their livestock to Joseph, and Joseph gave

        them bread in exchange for the horses, and for the flocks,

        and for the herds, and for the donkeys:  and he fed them

        with bread in exchange for all their livestock for that year.

047:018 When that year was ended, they came to him the second year,

        and said to him, "We will not hide from my lord how our money

        is all spent, and the herds of livestock are my lord's. There

        is nothing left in the sight of my lord, but our bodies,

        and our lands.

047:019 Why should we die before your eyes, both we and our land?

        Buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will

        be servants to Pharaoh.  Give us seed, that we may live,

        and not die, and that the land won't be desolate."

047:020 So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh,

        for the Egyptians sold every man his field, because the famine

        was severe on them, and the land became Pharaoh's.

047:021 As for the people, he moved them to the cities from one end

        of the border of Egypt even to the other end of it.

047:022 Only he didn't buy the land of the priests, for the priests had a

        portion from Pharaoh, and ate their portion which Pharaoh gave them.

        That is why they didn't sell their land.

047:023 Then Joseph said to the people, "Behold, I have bought you

        and your land today for Pharaoh.  Behold, here is seed for you,

        and you shall sow the land.

047:024 It will happen at the harvests, that you shall give a fifth

        to Pharaoh, and four parts will be your own, for seed

        of the field, for your food, for them of your households,

        and for food for your little ones."

047:025 They said, "You have saved our lives!  Let us find favor

        in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh's servants."

047:026 Joseph made it a statute concerning the land of Egypt

        to this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth.

        Only the land of the priests alone didn't become Pharaoh's.

047:027 Israel lived in the land of Egypt, in the land of Goshen;

        and they got themselves possessions therein, and were fruitful,

        and multiplied exceedingly.

047:028 Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years.

        So the days of Jacob, the years of his life, were one

        hundred forty-seven years.

047:029 The time drew near that Israel must die, and he called his son Joseph,

        and said to him, "If now I have found favor in your sight, please put

        your hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me.

        Please don't bury me in Egypt,

047:030 but when I sleep with my fathers, you shall carry me

        out of Egypt, and bury me in their burying place."

        He said, "I will do as you have said."

047:031 He said, "Swear to me," and he swore to him.  Israel bowed

        himself on the bed's head.

048:001 It happened after these things, that someone said to Joseph, "Behold,

        your father is sick."  He took with him his two sons,

        Manasseh and Ephraim.

048:002 Someone told Jacob, and said, "Behold, your son Joseph comes to you,"

        and Israel strengthened himself, and sat on the bed.

048:003 Jacob said to Joseph, "God Almighty appeared to me at Luz

        in the land of Canaan, and blessed me,

048:004 and said to me, 'Behold, I will make you fruitful, and multiply you,

        and I will make of you a company of peoples, and will give this

        land to your seed after you for an everlasting possession.'

048:005 Now your two sons, who were born to you in the land of Egypt

        before I came to you into Egypt, are mine; Ephraim and Manasseh,

        even as Reuben and Simeon, will be mine.

048:006 Your issue, who you become the father of after them, will be yours.

        They will be called after the name of their brothers

        in their inheritance.

048:007 As for me, when I came from Paddan, Rachel died by me in the land

        of Canaan in the way, when there was still some distance to come

        to Ephrath, and I buried her there in the way to Ephrath

        (the same is Bethlehem)."

048:008 Israel saw Joseph's sons, and said, "Who are these?"

048:009 Joseph said to his father, "They are my sons, whom God

        has given me here."  He said, "Please bring them to me,

        and I will bless them."

048:010 Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he couldn't see.

        He brought them near to him; and he kissed them,

        and embraced them.

048:011 Israel said to Joseph, "I didn't think I would see your face,

        and behold, God has let me see your seed also."

048:012 Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed

        himself with his face to the earth.

048:013 Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel's

        left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel's

        right hand, and brought them near to him.

048:014 Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it on Ephraim's head,

        who was the younger, and his left hand on Manasseh's head,

        guiding his hands knowingly, for Manasseh was the firstborn.

048:015 He blessed Joseph, and said, "The God before whom my fathers

        Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God who has fed me all my life

        long to this day,

048:016 the angel who has redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads,

        and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers

        Abraham and Isaac.  Let them grow into a multitude in the midst

        of the earth."

048:017 When Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand on the head

        of Ephraim, it displeased him.  He held up his father's hand,

        to remove it from Ephraim's head to Manasseh's head.

048:018 Joseph said to his father, "Not so, my father; for this is

        the firstborn; put your right hand on his head."

048:019 His father refused, and said, "I know, my son, I know.

        He also will become a people, and he also will be great.

        However, his younger brother will be greater than he,

        and his seed will become a multitude of nations."

048:020 He blessed them that day, saying, "In you will Israel bless,

        saying, 'God make you as Ephraim and as Manasseh'" He set

        Ephraim before Manasseh.

048:021 Israel said to Joseph, "Behold, I am dying, but God will be

        with you, and bring you again to the land of your fathers.

048:022 Moreover I have given to you one portion above your brothers,

        which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword

        and with my bow."

049:001 Jacob called to his sons, and said:  "Gather yourselves together,

        that I may tell you that which will happen to you in the

        days to come.

049:002 Assemble yourselves, and hear, you sons of Jacob.

        Listen to Israel, your father.

049:003 "Reuben, you are my firstborn, my might, and the beginning

        of my strength; excelling in dignity, and excelling in power.

049:004 Boiling over as water, you shall not excel; because you

        went up to your father's bed, then defiled it.

        He went up to my couch.

049:005 "Simeon and Levi are brothers.  Their swords are weapons of violence.

049:006 My soul, don't come into their council.  My glory, don't be

        united to their assembly; for in their anger they killed men.

        In their self-will they hamstrung oxen.

049:007 Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; and their wrath,

        for it was cruel.  I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter

        them in Israel.

049:008 "Judah, your brothers will praise you.  Your hand will be

        on the neck of your enemies.  Your father's sons will bow

        down before you.

049:009 Judah is a lion's cub.  From the prey, my son, you have gone up.

        He stooped down, he crouched as a lion, as a lioness.

        Who will rouse him up?

049:010 The scepter will not depart from Judah, nor the ruler's staff

        from between his feet, until he comes to whom it belongs.

        To him will the obedience of the peoples be.

049:011 Binding his foal to the vine, his donkey's colt to the choice vine;

        he has washed his garments in wine, his robes in the

        blood of grapes.

049:012 His eyes will be red with wine, his teeth white with milk.

049:013 "Zebulun will dwell at the haven of the sea.  He will be for

        a haven of ships.  His border will be on Sidon.

049:014 "Issachar is a strong donkey, lying down between the saddlebags.

049:015 He saw a resting place, that it was good, the land,

        that it was pleasant.  He bows his shoulder to the burden,

        and becomes a servant doing forced labor.

049:016 "Dan will judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel.

049:017 Dan will be a serpent in the way, an adder in the path,

        That bites the horse's heels, so that his rider falls backward.

049:018 I have waited for your salvation, Yahweh.

049:019 "A troop will press on Gad, but he will press on their heel.

049:020 "Asher's food will be rich.  He will yield royal dainties.

049:021 "Naphtali is a doe set free, who bears beautiful fawns.

049:022 "Joseph is a fruitful vine, a fruitful vine by a spring.

        His branches run over the wall.

049:023 The archers have sorely grieved him, shot at him,

        and persecute him:

049:024 But his bow remained strong.  The arms of his hands were

        made strong, by the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob,

        (from there is the shepherd, the stone of Israel),

049:025 even by the God of your father, who will help you; by the Almighty,

        who will bless you, with blessings of heaven above,

        blessings of the deep that lies below, blessings of the breasts,

        and of the womb.

049:026 The blessings of your father have prevailed above the blessings

        of your ancestors, above the boundaries of the ancient hills.

        They will be on the head of Joseph, on the crown of the head

        of him who is separated from his brothers.

049:027 "Benjamin is a ravenous wolf.  In the morning he will devour

        the prey.  At evening he will divide the spoil."

049:028 All these are the twelve tribes of Israel, and this

        is what their father spoke to them and blessed them.

        He blessed everyone according to his blessing.

049:029 He charged them, and said to them, "I am to be gathered to my people.

        Bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field

        of Ephron the Hittite,

049:030 in the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre,

        in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field

        from Ephron the Hittite as a burial place.

049:031 There they buried Abraham and Sarah, his wife.  There they

        buried Isaac and Rebekah, his wife, and there I buried Leah:

049:032 the field and the cave that is therein, which was purchased

        from the children of Heth."

049:033 When Jacob made an end of charging his sons, he gathered

        up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the spirit,

        and was gathered to his people.

050:001 Joseph fell on his father's face, wept on him, and kissed him.

050:002 Joseph commanded his servants, the physicians, to embalm his father;

        and the physicians embalmed Israel.

050:003 Forty days were fulfilled for him, for that is how many

        the days it takes to embalm.  The Egyptians wept for him

        for seventy days.

050:004 When the days of weeping for him were past, Joseph spoke

        to the house of Pharaoh, saying, "If now I have found favor

        in your eyes, please speak in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,

050:005 'My father made me swear, saying, "Behold, I am dying.  Bury me

        in my grave which I have dug for myself in the land of Canaan."

        Now therefore, please let me go up and bury my father,

        and I will come again.'"

050:006 Pharaoh said, "Go up, and bury your father, just like he

        made you swear."

050:007 Joseph went up to bury his father; and with him went up

        all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house,

        all the elders of the land of Egypt,

050:008 all the house of Joseph, his brothers, and his father's house.

        Only their little ones, their flocks, and their herds,

        they left in the land of Goshen.

050:009 There went up with him both chariots and horsemen.

        It was a very great company.

050:010 They came to the threshing floor of Atad, which is beyond the Jordan,

        and there they lamented with a very great and sore lamentation.

        He mourned for his father seven days.

050:011 When the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning

        in the floor of Atad, they said, "This is a grievous mourning

        by the Egyptians."  Therefore, the name of it was called

        Abel Mizraim, which is beyond the Jordan.

050:012 His sons did to him just as he commanded them,

050:013 for his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried

        him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham

        bought with the field, for a possession of a burial site,

        from Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre.

050:014 Joseph returned into Egypt--he, and his brothers, and all

        that went up with him to bury his father, after he had

        buried his father.

050:015 When Joseph's brothers saw that their father was dead, they said,

        "It may be that Joseph will hate us, and will fully pay us

        back for all of the evil which we did to him."

050:016 They sent a message to Joseph, saying, "Your father commanded

        before he died, saying,

050:017 'You shall tell Joseph, "Now please forgive the disobedience

        of your brothers, and their sin, because they did evil to you."'

        Now, please forgive the disobedience of the servants of the God

        of your father."  Joseph wept when they spoke to him.

050:018 His brothers also went and fell down before his face;

        and they said, "Behold, we are your servants."

050:019 Joseph said to them, "Don't be afraid, for am I in the place of God?

050:020 As for you, you meant evil against me, but God meant it for good,

        to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save many people alive.

050:021 Now therefore don't be afraid.  I will nourish you and your

        little ones."  He comforted them, and spoke kindly to them.

050:022 Joseph lived in Egypt, he, and his father's house.

        Joseph lived one hundred ten years.

050:023 Joseph saw Ephraim's children to the third generation.

        The children also of Machir, the son of Manasseh, were born

        on Joseph's knees.

050:024 Joseph said to his brothers, "I am dying, but God will surely

        visit you, and bring you up out of this land to the land

        which he swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob."

050:025 Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, "God will

        surely visit you, and you shall carry up my bones from here."

050:026 So Joseph died, being one hundred ten years old, and they

        embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.

Book 02 Exodus

001:001 Now these are the names of the sons of Israel, who came into Egypt

        (every man and his household came with Jacob):

001:002 Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,

001:003 Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,

001:004 Dan and Naphtali, Gad and Asher.

001:005 All the souls who came out of Jacob's body were seventy souls,

        and Joseph was in Egypt already.

001:006 Joseph died, as did all his brothers, and all that generation.

001:007 The children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly,

        and multiplied, and grew exceedingly mighty; and the land

        was filled with them.

001:008 Now there arose a new king over Egypt, who didn't know Joseph.

001:009 He said to his people, "Behold, the people of the children

        of Israel are more and mightier than we.

001:010 Come, let us deal wisely with them, lest they multiply,

        and it happen that when any war breaks out, they also join

        themselves to our enemies, and fight against us, and escape

        out of the land."

001:011 Therefore they set taskmasters over them to afflict

        them with their burdens.  They built storage cities

        for Pharaoh:  Pithom and Raamses.

001:012 But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied

        and the more they spread out.  They were grieved because of

        the children of Israel.

001:013 The Egyptians ruthlessly made the children of Israel serve,

001:014 and they made their lives bitter with hard service, in mortar

        and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field,

        all their service, in which they ruthlessly made them serve.

001:015 The king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives, of whom the name

        of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah,

001:016 and he said, "When you perform the duty of a midwife

        to the Hebrew women, and see them on the birth stool;

        if it is a son, then you shall kill him; but if it is a daughter,

        then she shall live."

001:017 But the midwives feared God, and didn't do what the king

        of Egypt commanded them, but saved the baby boys alive.

001:018 The king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said to them,

        "Why have you done this thing, and have saved the boys alive?"

001:019 The midwives said to Pharaoh, "Because the Hebrew women

        aren't like the Egyptian women; for they are vigorous,

        and give birth before the midwife comes to them."

001:020 God dealt well with the midwives, and the people multiplied,

        and grew very mighty.

001:021 It happened, because the midwives feared God, that he

        gave them families.

001:022 Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, "You shall cast every

        son who is born into the river, and every daughter you

        shall save alive."

002:001 A man of the house of Levi went and took a daughter of Levi

        as his wife.

002:002 The woman conceived, and bore a son.  When she saw that he was

        a fine child, she hid him three months.

002:003 When she could no longer hide him, she took a papyrus

        basket for him, and coated it with tar and with pitch.

        She put the child in it, and laid it in the reeds by

        the river's bank.

002:004 His sister stood far off, to see what would be done to him.

002:005 Pharaoh's daughter came down to bathe at the river.

        Her maidens walked along by the riverside.  She saw the basket

        among the reeds, and sent her handmaid to get it.

002:006 She opened it, and saw the child, and behold, the baby cried.

        She had compassion on him, and said, "This is one of

        the Hebrews' children."

002:007 Then his sister said to Pharaoh's daughter, "Should I go

        and call a nurse for you from the Hebrew women, that she

        may nurse the child for you?"

002:008 Pharaoh's daughter said to her, "Go." The maiden went and called

        the child's mother.

002:009 Pharaoh's daughter said to her, "Take this child away,

        and nurse him for me, and I will give you your wages."

        The woman took the child, and nursed it.

002:010 The child grew, and she brought him to Pharaoh's daughter,

        and he became her son.  She named him Moses,{"Moses"

        sounds like the Hebrew for "draw out".} and said, "Because I

        drew him out of the water."

002:011 It happened in those days, when Moses had grown up,

        that he went out to his brothers, and looked at their burdens.

        He saw an Egyptian striking a Hebrew, one of his brothers.

002:012 He looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there

        was no one, he killed the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.

002:013 He went out the second day, and behold, two men of the Hebrews

        were fighting with each other.  He said to him who did the wrong,

        "Why do you strike your fellow?"

002:014 He said, "Who made you a prince and a judge over us?  Do you plan

        to kill me, as you killed the Egyptian?"  Moses was afraid,

        and said, "Surely this thing is known."

002:015 Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to kill Moses.

        But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and lived in the land

        of Midian, and he sat down by a well.

002:016 Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters.

        They came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water

        their father's flock.

002:017 The shepherds came and drove them away; but Moses stood up

        and helped them, and watered their flock.

002:018 When they came to Reuel, their father, he said, "How is it

        that you have returned so early today?"

002:019 They said, "An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds,

        and moreover he drew water for us, and watered the flock."

002:020 He said to his daughters, "Where is he?  Why is it that you

        have left the man?  Call him, that he may eat bread."

002:021 Moses was content to dwell with the man.  He gave

        Moses Zipporah, his daughter.

002:022 She bore a son, and he named him Gershom,{"Gershom"

        sounds like the Hebrew for "an alien there."} for he said,

        "I have lived as a foreigner in a foreign land."

002:023 It happened in the course of those many days, that the king

        of Egypt died, and the children of Israel sighed because of

        the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up to God

        because of the bondage.

002:024 God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant

        with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.

002:025 God saw the children of Israel, and God was concerned about them.

003:001 Now Moses was keeping the flock of Jethro, his father-in-law,

        the priest of Midian, and he led the flock to the back

        of the wilderness, and came to God's mountain, to Horeb.

003:002 The angel of Yahweh appeared to him in a flame of fire out

        of the midst of a bush.  He looked, and behold, the bush

        burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed.

003:003 Moses said, "I will turn aside now, and see this great sight,

        why the bush is not burnt."

003:004 When Yahweh saw that he turned aside to see, God called to him

        out of the midst of the bush, and said, "Moses!  Moses!"  He said,

        "Here I am."

003:005 He said, "Don't come close.  Take your sandals off of your feet,

        for the place you are standing on is holy ground."

003:006 Moreover he said, "I am the God of your father, the God

        of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob."

        Moses hid his face; for he was afraid to look at God.

003:007 Yahweh said, "I have surely seen the affliction of my people who are

        in Egypt, and have heard their cry because of their taskmasters,

        for I know their sorrows.

003:008 I have come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians,

        and to bring them up out of that land to a good and large land,

        to a land flowing with milk and honey; to the place

        of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, the Perizzite,

        the Hivite, and the Jebusite.

003:009 Now, behold, the cry of the children of Israel has come to me.

        Moreover I have seen the oppression with which the

        Egyptians oppress them.

003:010 Come now therefore, and I will send you to Pharaoh,

        that you may bring forth my people, the children of Israel,

        out of Egypt."

003:011 Moses said to God, "Who am I, that I should go to Pharaoh,

        and that I should bring forth the children of Israel

        out of Egypt?"

003:012 He said, "Certainly I will be with you.  This will be the token

        to you, that I have sent you:  when you have brought forth

        the people out of Egypt, you shall serve God on this mountain."

003:013 Moses said to God, "Behold, when I come to the children

        of Israel, and tell them, 'The God of your fathers has

        sent me to you;' and they ask me, 'What is his name?'

        What should I tell them?"

003:014 God said to Moses, "I AM WHO I AM," and he said, "You shall tell

        the children of Israel this:  'I AM has sent me to you.'"

003:015 God said moreover to Moses, "You shall tell the children of

        Israel this, 'Yahweh, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham,

        the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you.'

        This is my name forever, and this is my memorial to all generations.

003:016 Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and tell them,

        'Yahweh, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac,

        and of Jacob, has appeared to me, saying, "I have surely

        visited you, and seen that which is done to you in Egypt;

003:017 and I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction

        of Egypt to the land of the Canaanite, the Hittite,

        the Amorite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite,

        to a land flowing with milk and honey."'

003:018 They will listen to your voice, and you shall come, you and

        the elders of Israel, to the king of Egypt, and you shall

        tell him, 'Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews, has met with us.

        Now please let us go three days' journey into the wilderness,

        that we may sacrifice to Yahweh, our God.'

003:019 I know that the king of Egypt won't give you permission

        to go, no, not by a mighty hand.

003:020 I will put forth my hand and strike Egypt with all my wonders

        which I will do in the midst of it, and after that he will

        let you go.

003:021 I will give this people favor in the sight of the Egyptians,

        and it will happen that when you go, you shall not go empty-handed.

003:022 But every woman shall ask of her neighbor, and of her who visits

        her house, jewels of silver, jewels of gold, and clothing;

        and you shall put them on your sons, and on your daughters.

        You shall despoil the Egyptians.

004:001 Moses answered, "But, behold, they will not believe me,

        nor listen to my voice; for they will say, 'Yahweh has not

        appeared to you.'"

004:002 Yahweh said to him, "What is that in your hand?"

        He said, "A rod."

004:003 He said, "Throw it on the ground."  He threw it on the ground,

        and it became a snake; and Moses ran away from it.

004:004 Yahweh said to Moses, "Put forth your hand, and take it by the tail."

        He put forth his hand, and laid hold of it, and it became

        a rod in his hand.

004:005 "That they may believe that Yahweh, the God of their fathers,

        the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob,

        has appeared to you."

004:006 Yahweh said furthermore to him, "Now put your hand inside

        your cloak."  He put his hand inside his cloak, and when he took

        it out, behold, his hand was leprous, as white as snow.

004:007 He said, "Put your hand inside your cloak again."

        He put his hand inside his cloak again, and when he took it out

        of his cloak, behold, it had turned again as his other flesh.

004:008 "It will happen, if they will neither believe you nor listen

        to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe

        the voice of the latter sign.

004:009 It will happen, if they will not believe even these two signs,

        neither listen to your voice, that you shall take

        of the water of the river, and pour it on the dry land.

        The water which you take out of the river will become blood

        on the dry land."

004:010 Moses said to Yahweh, "Oh, Lord, I am not eloquent,

        neither before now, nor since you have spoken to your servant;

        for I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue."

004:011 Yahweh said to him, "Who made man's mouth?  Or who makes one mute,

        or deaf, or seeing, or blind?  Isn't it I, Yahweh?

004:012 Now therefore go, and I will be with your mouth, and teach

        you what you shall speak."

004:013 He said, "Oh, Lord, please send someone else."

004:014 The anger of Yahweh was kindled against Moses, and he said,

        "What about Aaron, your brother, the Levite?  I know that he can

        speak well.  Also, behold, he comes forth to meet you.

        When he sees you, he will be glad in his heart.

004:015 You shall speak to him, and put the words in his mouth.

        I will be with your mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach

        you what you shall do.

004:016 He will be your spokesman to the people; and it will happen,

        that he will be to you a mouth, and you will be to him as God.

004:017 You shall take this rod in your hand, with which you shall

        do the signs."

004:018 Moses went and returned to Jethro his father-in-law,

        and said to him, "Please let me go and return to my brothers

        who are in Egypt, and see whether they are still alive."

        Jethro said to Moses, "Go in peace."

004:019 Yahweh said to Moses in Midian, "Go, return into Egypt;

        for all the men who sought your life are dead."

004:020 Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them on a donkey,

        and he returned to the land of Egypt.  Moses took God's rod

        in his hand.

004:021 Yahweh said to Moses, "When you go back into Egypt, see that you

        do before Pharaoh all the wonders which I have put in your hand,

        but I will harden his heart and he will not let the people go.

004:022 You shall tell Pharaoh, 'Thus says Yahweh, Israel is

        my son, my firstborn,

004:023 and I have said to you, "Let my son go, that he may serve me;"

        and you have refused to let him go.  Behold, I will kill

        your son, your firstborn.'"

004:024 It happened on the way at a lodging place, that Yahweh met

        him and wanted to kill him.

004:025 Then Zipporah took a flint, and cut off the foreskin of her son,

        and cast it at his feet; and she said, "Surely you are a

        bridegroom of blood to me."

004:026 So he let him alone.  Then she said, "You are a bridegroom

        of blood," because of the circumcision.

004:027 Yahweh said to Aaron, "Go into the wilderness to meet Moses."

        He went, and met him on God's mountain, and kissed him.

004:028 Moses told Aaron all the words of Yahweh with which he had

        sent him, and all the signs with which he had charged him.

004:029 Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders

        of the children of Israel.

004:030 Aaron spoke all the words which Yahweh had spoken to Moses,

        and did the signs in the sight of the people.

004:031 The people believed, and when they heard that Yahweh had visited

        the children of Israel, and that he had seen their affliction,

        then they bowed their heads and worshiped.

005:001 Afterward Moses and Aaron came, and said to Pharaoh, "This is

        what Yahweh, the God of Israel, says, 'Let my people go,

        that they may hold a feast to me in the wilderness.'"

005:002 Pharaoh said, "Who is Yahweh, that I should listen to his voice

        to let Israel go?  I don't know Yahweh, and moreover I will

        not let Israel go."

005:003 They said, "The God of the Hebrews has met with us.

        Please let us go three days' journey into the wilderness,

        and sacrifice to Yahweh, our God, lest he fall on us

        with pestilence, or with the sword."

005:004 The king of Egypt said to them, "Why do you, Moses and Aaron,

        take the people from their work?  Get back to your burdens!"

005:005 Pharaoh said, "Behold, the people of the land are now many,

        and you make them rest from their burdens."

005:006 The same day Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters of the people,

        and their officers, saying,

005:007 "You shall no longer give the people straw to make brick, as before.

        Let them go and gather straw for themselves.

005:008 The number of the bricks, which they made before, you require

        from them.  You shall not diminish anything of it, for they

        are idle; therefore they cry, saying, 'Let us go and sacrifice

        to our God.'

005:009 Let heavier work be laid on the men, that they may labor therein;

        and don't let them pay any attention to lying words."

005:010 The taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers,

        and they spoke to the people, saying, This is what Pharaoh says:

        "I will not give you straw.

005:011 Go yourselves, get straw where you can find it, for nothing

        of your work shall be diminished."

005:012 So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land

        of Egypt to gather stubble for straw.

005:013 The taskmasters were urgent saying, "Fulfill your work quota daily,

        as when there was straw!"

005:014 The officers of the children of Israel, whom Pharaoh's

        taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and demanded,

        "Why haven't you fulfilled your quota both yesterday and today,

        in making brick as before?"

005:015 Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried

        to Pharaoh, saying, "Why do you deal this way with your servants?

005:016 No straw is given to your servants, and they tell us,

        'Make brick!' and behold, your servants are beaten;

        but the fault is in your own people."

005:017 But he said, "You are idle!  You are idle!  Therefore you say,

        'Let us go and sacrifice to Yahweh.'

005:018 Go therefore now, and work, for no straw shall be given to you,

        yet shall you deliver the same number of bricks!"

005:019 The officers of the children of Israel saw that they were

        in trouble, when it was said, "You shall not diminish anything

        from your daily quota of bricks!"

005:020 They met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came

        forth from Pharaoh:

005:021 and they said to them, "May Yahweh look at you, and judge,

        because you have made us a stench to be abhorred in the eyes

        of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword

        in their hand to kill us."

005:022 Moses returned to Yahweh, and said, "Lord, why have you brought

        trouble on this people?  Why is it that you have sent me?

005:023 For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in your name, he has

        brought trouble on this people; neither have you delivered

        your people at all."

006:001 Yahweh said to Moses, "Now you shall see what I will do to Pharaoh,

        for by a strong hand he shall let them go, and by a strong

        hand he shall drive them out of his land."

006:002 God spoke to Moses, and said to him, "I am Yahweh;

006:003 and I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, as God Almighty;

        but by my name Yahweh I was not known to them.

006:004 I have also established my covenant with them, to give them

        the land of Canaan, the land of their travels, in which they

        lived as aliens.

006:005 Moreover I have heard the groaning of the children of Israel,

        whom the Egyptians keep in bondage, and I have remembered

        my covenant.

006:006 Therefore tell the children of Israel, 'I am Yahweh, and I

        will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians,

        and I will rid you out of their bondage, and I will redeem

        you with an outstretched arm, and with great judgments:

006:007 and I will take you to me for a people, and I will be to you a God;

        and you shall know that I am Yahweh your God, who brings you

        out from under the burdens of the Egyptians.

006:008 I will bring you into the land which I swore to give to Abraham,

        to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it to you for a heritage:

        I am Yahweh.'"

006:009 Moses spoke so to the children of Israel, but they didn't listen

        to Moses for anguish of spirit, and for cruel bondage.

006:010 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

006:011 "Go in, speak to Pharaoh king of Egypt, that he let the children

        of Israel go out of his land."

006:012 Moses spoke before Yahweh, saying, "Behold, the children of Israel

        haven't listened to me.  How then shall Pharaoh listen to me,

        who am of uncircumcised lips?"

006:013 Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, and gave them a charge

        to the children of Israel, and to Pharaoh king of Egypt,

        to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt.

006:014 These are the heads of their fathers' houses.  The sons of Reuben

        the firstborn of Israel:  Hanoch, and Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi;

        these are the families of Reuben.

006:015 The sons of Simeon:  Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jachin,

        and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman;

        these are the families of Simeon.

006:016 These are the names of the sons of Levi according to

        their generations:  Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari; and the years

        of the life of Levi were one hundred thirty-seven years.

006:017 The sons of Gershon:  Libni and Shimei, according to their families.

006:018 The sons of Kohath:  Amram, and Izhar, and Hebron,

        and Uzziel; and the years of the life of Kohath were one

        hundred thirty-three years.

006:019 The sons of Merari:  Mahli and Mushi.  These are the families

        of the Levites according to their generations.

006:020 Amram took Jochebed his father's sister to himself as wife;

        and she bore him Aaron and Moses:  and the years of the life

        of Amram were a hundred and thirty-seven years.

006:021 The sons of Izhar:  Korah, and Nepheg, and Zichri.

006:022 The sons of Uzziel:  Mishael, and Elzaphan, and Sithri.

006:023 Aaron took Elisheba, the daughter of Amminadab,

        the sister of Nahshon, as his wife; and she bore him Nadab

        and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.

006:024 The sons of Korah:  Assir, and Elkanah, and Abiasaph;

        these are the families of the Korahites.

006:025 Eleazar Aaron's son took one of the daughters of Putiel as his wife;

        and she bore him Phinehas.  These are the heads of the fathers'

        houses of the Levites according to their families.

006:026 These are that Aaron and Moses, to whom Yahweh said,

        "Bring out the children of Israel from the land of Egypt

        according to their armies."

006:027 These are those who spoke to Pharaoh king of Egypt,

        to bring out the children of Israel from Egypt.

        These are that Moses and Aaron.

006:028 It happened on the day when Yahweh spoke to Moses in the

        land of Egypt,

006:029 that Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, "I am Yahweh.

        Speak to Pharaoh king of Egypt all that I speak to you."

006:030 Moses said before Yahweh, "Behold, I am of uncircumcised lips,

        and how shall Pharaoh listen to me?"

007:001 Yahweh said to Moses, "Behold, I have made you as God to Pharaoh;

        and Aaron your brother shall be your prophet.

007:002 You shall speak all that I command you; and Aaron your brother

        shall speak to Pharaoh, that he let the children of Israel

        go out of his land.

007:003 I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and multiply my signs and my

        wonders in the land of Egypt.

007:004 But Pharaoh will not listen to you, and I will lay my hand on Egypt,

        and bring forth my armies, my people the children of Israel,

        out of the land of Egypt by great judgments.

007:005 The Egyptians shall know that I am Yahweh, when I stretch

        forth my hand on Egypt, and bring out the children of Israel

        from among them."

007:006 Moses and Aaron did so.  As Yahweh commanded them, so they did.

007:007 Moses was eighty years old, and Aaron eighty-three years old,

        when they spoke to Pharaoh.

007:008 Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,

007:009 "When Pharaoh speaks to you, saying, 'Perform a miracle!'

        then you shall tell Aaron, 'Take your rod, and cast it down

        before Pharaoh, that it become a serpent.'"

007:010 Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh, and they did so, as Yahweh

        had commanded:  and Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh

        and before his servants, and it became a serpent.

007:011 Then Pharaoh also called for the wise men and the sorcerers.

        They also, the magicians of Egypt, did in like manner

        with their enchantments.

007:012 For they cast down every man his rod, and they became serpents:

        but Aaron's rod swallowed up their rods.

007:013 Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he didn't listen to them;

        as Yahweh had spoken.

007:014 Yahweh said to Moses, "Pharaoh's heart is stubborn.

        He refuses to let the people go.

007:015 Go to Pharaoh in the morning.  Behold, he goes out to the water;

        and you shall stand by the river's bank to meet him;

        and the rod which was turned to a serpent you shall take

        in your hand.

007:016 You shall tell him, 'Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews, has sent

        me to you, saying, "Let my people go, that they may serve me

        in the wilderness:"  and behold, until now you haven't listened.

007:017 Thus says Yahweh, "In this you shall know that I am Yahweh.

        Behold, I will strike with the rod that is in my hand on the waters

        which are in the river, and they shall be turned to blood.

007:018 The fish that are in the river shall die, and the river shall

        become foul; and the Egyptians shall loathe to drink water

        from the river."'"

007:019 Yahweh said to Moses, "Tell Aaron, 'Take your rod,

        and stretch out your hand over the waters of Egypt,

        over their rivers, over their streams, and over their pools,

        and over all their ponds of water, that they may become blood;

        and there shall be blood throughout all the land of Egypt,

        both in vessels of wood and in vessels of stone.'"

007:020 Moses and Aaron did so, as Yahweh commanded; and he lifted

        up the rod, and struck the waters that were in the river,

        in the sight of Pharaoh, and in the sight of his servants;

        and all the waters that were in the river were turned to blood.

007:021 The fish that were in the river died; and the river became foul,

        and the Egyptians couldn't drink water from the river;

        and the blood was throughout all the land of Egypt.

007:022 The magicians of Egypt did in like manner with their enchantments;

        and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he didn't listen to them;

        as Yahweh had spoken.

007:023 Pharaoh turned and went into his house, neither did he lay

        even this to heart.

007:024 All the Egyptians dug round about the river for water to drink;

        for they couldn't drink of the water of the river.

007:025 Seven days were fulfilled, after Yahweh had struck the river.

008:001 Yahweh spoke to Moses, Go in to Pharaoh, and tell him,

        "This is what Yahweh says, 'Let my people go, that they

        may serve me.

008:002 If you refuse to let them go, behold, I will plague all your

        borders with frogs:

008:003 and the river shall swarm with frogs, which shall go up and come

        into your house, and into your bedchamber, and on your bed,

        and into the house of your servants, and on your people,

        and into your ovens, and into your kneading troughs:

008:004 and the frogs shall come up both on you, and on your people,

        and on all your servants.'"

008:005 Yahweh said to Moses, "Tell Aaron, 'Stretch forth your hand with

        your rod over the rivers, over the streams, and over the pools,

        and cause frogs to come up on the land of Egypt.'"

008:006 Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt;

        and the frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt.

008:007 The magicians did in like manner with their enchantments,

        and brought up frogs on the land of Egypt.

008:008 Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, "Entreat Yahweh,

        that he take away the frogs from me, and from my people;

        and I will let the people go, that they may sacrifice to Yahweh."

008:009 Moses said to Pharaoh, "I give you the honor of setting

        the time that I should pray for you, and for your servants,

        and for your people, that the frogs be destroyed from you

        and your houses, and remain in the river only."

008:010 He said, "Tomorrow." He said, "Be it according to your word,

        that you may know that there is none like Yahweh our God.

008:011 The frogs shall depart from you, and from your houses,

        and from your servants, and from your people.  They shall

        remain in the river only."

008:012 Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh, and Moses cried to Yahweh

        concerning the frogs which he had brought on Pharaoh.

008:013 Yahweh did according to the word of Moses, and the frogs died

        out of the houses, out of the courts, and out of the fields.

008:014 They gathered them together in heaps, and the land stank.

008:015 But when Pharaoh saw that there was a respite, he hardened

        his heart, and didn't listen to them, as Yahweh had spoken.

008:016 Yahweh said to Moses, "Tell Aaron, 'Stretch out your rod,

        and strike the dust of the earth, that it may become lice

        throughout all the land of Egypt.'"

008:017 They did so; and Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod,

        and struck the dust of the earth, and there were lice on man,

        and on animal; all the dust of the earth became lice throughout

        all the land of Egypt.

008:018 The magicians tried with their enchantments to bring forth lice,

        but they couldn't. There were lice on man, and on animal.

008:019 Then the magicians said to Pharaoh, "This is the finger of God:"

        and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he didn't listen to them;

        as Yahweh had spoken.

008:020 Yahweh said to Moses, "Rise up early in the morning,

        and stand before Pharaoh; behold, he comes forth to the water;

        and tell him, 'This is what Yahweh says, "Let my people go,

        that they may serve me.

008:021 Else, if you will not let my people go, behold, I will send swarms

        of flies on you, and on your servants, and on your people,

        and into your houses:  and the houses of the Egyptians shall be

        full of swarms of flies, and also the ground whereon they are.

008:022 I will set apart in that day the land of Goshen, in which

        my people dwell, that no swarms of flies shall be there;

        to the end you may know that I am Yahweh in the midst

        of the earth.

008:023 I will put a division between my people and your people:

        by tomorrow shall this sign be."'"

008:024 Yahweh did so; and there came grievous swarms of flies

        into the house of Pharaoh, and into his servants' houses:

        and in all the land of Egypt the land was corrupted by reason

        of the swarms of flies.

008:025 Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said, "Go, sacrifice to

        your God in the land!"

008:026 Moses said, "It isn't appropriate to do so; for we shall

        sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to Yahweh our God.

        Behold, shall we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians

        before their eyes, and won't they stone us?

008:027 We will go three days' journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice

        to Yahweh our God, as he shall command us."

008:028 Pharaoh said, "I will let you go, that you may sacrifice to Yahweh

        your God in the wilderness, only you shall not go very far away.

        Pray for me."

008:029 Moses said, "Behold, I go out from you, and I will pray

        to Yahweh that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh,

        from his servants, and from his people, tomorrow; only don't

        let Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in not letting the people

        go to sacrifice to Yahweh."

008:030 Moses went out from Pharaoh, and prayed to Yahweh.

008:031 Yahweh did according to the word of Moses, and he removed the swarms

        of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people.

        There remained not one.

008:032 Pharaoh hardened his heart this time also, and he didn't let

        the people go.

009:001 Then Yahweh said to Moses, "Go in to Pharaoh, and tell him,

        'This is what Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews, says:

        "Let my people go, that they may serve me.

009:002 For if you refuse to let them go, and hold them still,

009:003 behold, the hand of Yahweh is on your livestock which are

        in the field, on the horses, on the donkeys, on the camels,

        on the herds, and on the flocks with a very grievous pestilence.

009:004 Yahweh will make a distinction between the livestock of Israel

        and the livestock of Egypt; and there shall nothing die

        of all that belongs to the children of Israel."'"

009:005 Yahweh appointed a set time, saying, "Tomorrow Yahweh shall

        do this thing in the land."

009:006 Yahweh did that thing on the next day; and all the livestock

        of Egypt died, but of the livestock of the children of Israel,

        not one died.

009:007 Pharaoh sent, and, behold, there was not so much as one of

        the livestock of the Israelites dead.  But the heart of Pharaoh

        was stubborn, and he didn't let the people go.

009:008 Yahweh said to Moses and to Aaron, "Take to you handfuls

        of ashes of the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it toward

        the sky in the sight of Pharaoh.

009:009 It shall become small dust over all the land of Egypt, and shall

        be a boil breaking forth with boils on man and on animal,

        throughout all the land of Egypt."

009:010 They took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh;

        and Moses sprinkled it up toward the sky; and it became a boil

        breaking forth with boils on man and on animal.

009:011 The magicians couldn't stand before Moses because of the boils;

        for the boils were on the magicians, and on all the Egyptians.

009:012 Yahweh hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he didn't listen

        to them, as Yahweh had spoken to Moses.

009:013 Yahweh said to Moses, "Rise up early in the morning,

        and stand before Pharaoh, and tell him, 'This is what Yahweh,

        the God of the Hebrews, says:  "Let my people go, that they

        may serve me.

009:014 For this time I will send all my plagues against your heart,

        against your officials, and against your people; that you

        may know that there is none like me in all the earth.

009:015 For now I would have put forth my hand, and struck you and

        your people with pestilence, and you would have been cut off

        from the earth;

009:016 but indeed for this cause I have made you stand:

        to show you my power, and that my name may be declared

        throughout all the earth;

009:017 as you still exalt yourself against my people, that you won't

        let them go.

009:018 Behold, tomorrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very

        grievous hail, such as has not been in Egypt since the day

        it was founded even until now.

009:019 Now therefore command that all of your livestock and all

        that you have in the field be brought into shelter.

        Every man and animal that is found in the field,

        and isn't brought home, the hail shall come down on them,

        and they shall die."'"

009:020 Those who feared the word of Yahweh among the servants of Pharaoh

        made their servants and their livestock flee into the houses.

009:021 Whoever didn't regard the word of Yahweh left his servants

        and his livestock in the field.

009:022 Yahweh said to Moses, "Stretch forth your hand toward the sky,

        that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, on man,

        and on animal, and on every herb of the field, throughout the

        land of Egypt."

009:023 Moses stretched forth his rod toward the heavens, and Yahweh

        sent thunder, hail, and lightning flashed down to the earth.

        Yahweh rained hail on the land of Egypt.

009:024 So there was very severe hail, and lightning mixed with the hail,

        such as had not been in all the land of Egypt since it

        became a nation.

009:025 The hail struck throughout all the land of Egypt all that was

        in the field, both man and animal; and the hail struck every

        herb of the field, and broke every tree of the field.

009:026 Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were,

        there was no hail.

009:027 Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said to them,

        "I have sinned this time.  Yahweh is righteous, and I and my

        people are wicked.

009:028 Pray to Yahweh; for there has been enough of mighty thunderings

        and hail.  I will let you go, and you shall stay no longer."

009:029 Moses said to him, "As soon as I have gone out of the city,

        I will spread abroad my hands to Yahweh.  The thunders

        shall cease, neither shall there be any more hail; that you

        may know that the earth is Yahweh's.

009:030 But as for you and your servants, I know that you don't yet

        fear Yahweh God."

009:031 The flax and the barley were struck, for the barley was in the ear,

        and the flax was in bloom.

009:032 But the wheat and the spelt were not struck, for they had

        not grown up.

009:033 Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroad

        his hands to Yahweh; and the thunders and hail ceased,

        and the rain was not poured on the earth.

009:034 When Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders

        were ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart,

        he and his servants.

009:035 The heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he didn't let the children

        of Israel go, just as Yahweh had spoken through Moses.

010:001 Yahweh said to Moses, "Go in to Pharaoh, for I have hardened

        his heart, and the heart of his servants, that I may show

        these my signs in the midst of them,

010:002 and that you may tell in the hearing of your son,

        and of your son's son, what things I have done to Egypt,

        and my signs which I have done among them; that you may know

        that I am Yahweh."

010:003 Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh, and said to him,

        "This is what Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews, says:

        'How long will you refuse to humble yourself before me?

        Let my people go, that they may serve me.

010:004 Or else, if you refuse to let my people go, behold, tomorrow I

        will bring locusts into your country,

010:005 and they shall cover the surface of the earth, so that one

        won't be able to see the earth.  They shall eat the residue

        of that which has escaped, which remains to you from the hail,

        and shall eat every tree which grows for you out of the field.

010:006 Your houses shall be filled, and the houses of all

        your servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians;

        as neither your fathers nor your fathers' fathers have seen,

        since the day that they were on the earth to this day.'"

        He turned, and went out from Pharaoh.

010:007 Pharaoh's servants said to him, "How long will this man be a snare

        to us?  Let the men go, that they may serve Yahweh, their God.

        Don't you yet know that Egypt is destroyed?"

010:008 Moses and Aaron were brought again to Pharaoh, and he said

        to them, "Go, serve Yahweh your God; but who are those

        who will go?"

010:009 Moses said, "We will go with our young and with our old;

        with our sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with

        our herds will we go; for we must hold a feast to Yahweh."

010:010 He said to them, "Yahweh be with you if I will let you go

        with your little ones!  See, evil is clearly before your faces.

010:011 Not so!  Go now you who are men, and serve Yahweh; for that is

        what you desire!"  They were driven out from Pharaoh's presence.

010:012 Yahweh said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand over the land

        of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up on the land

        of Egypt, and eat every herb of the land, even all that

        the hail has left."

010:013 Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt,

        and Yahweh brought an east wind on the land all that day,

        and all the night; and when it was morning, the east wind

        brought the locusts.

010:014 The locusts went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested

        in all the borders of Egypt.  They were very grievous.

        Before them there were no such locusts as they, neither after

        them shall be such.

010:015 For they covered the surface of the whole earth, so that

        the land was darkened, and they ate every herb of the land,

        and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left.

        There remained nothing green, either tree or herb of the field,

        through all the land of Egypt.

010:016 Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste, and he said,

        "I have sinned against Yahweh your God, and against you.

010:017 Now therefore please forgive my sin again, and pray to Yahweh

        your God, that he may also take away from me this death."

010:018 He went out from Pharaoh, and prayed to Yahweh.

010:019 Yahweh turned an exceeding strong west wind, which took up

        the locusts, and drove them into the Red Sea{or, Sea of Reeds}.

        There remained not one locust in all the borders of Egypt.

010:020 But Yahweh hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he didn't let

        the children of Israel go.

010:021 Yahweh said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand toward the sky,

        that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even darkness

        which may be felt."

010:022 Moses stretched forth his hand toward the sky, and there was

        a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days.

010:023 They didn't see one another, neither did anyone rise from his

        place for three days; but all the children of Israel had light

        in their dwellings.

010:024 Pharaoh called to Moses, and said, "Go, serve Yahweh.

        Only let your flocks and your herds stay behind.

        Let your little ones also go with you."

010:025 Moses said, "You must also give into our hand sacrifices

        and burnt offerings, that we may sacrifice to Yahweh our God.

010:026 Our livestock also shall go with us.  There shall not a hoof

        be left behind, for of it we must take to serve Yahweh

        our God; and we don't know with what we must serve Yahweh,

        until we come there."

010:027 But Yahweh hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he wouldn't let them go.

010:028 Pharaoh said to him, "Get away from me!  Be careful to see my

        face no more; for in the day you see my face you shall die!"

010:029 Moses said, "You have spoken well.  I will see your face

        again no more."

011:001 Yahweh said to Moses, "Yet one plague more will I bring

        on Pharaoh, and on Egypt; afterwards he will let you go.

        When he lets you go, he will surely thrust you out altogether.

011:002 Speak now in the ears of the people, and let them ask every

        man of his neighbor, and every woman of her neighbor,

        jewels of silver, and jewels of gold."

011:003 Yahweh gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians.

        Moreover the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt,

        in the sight of Pharaoh's servants, and in the sight

        of the people.

011:004 Moses said, "This is what Yahweh says:  'About midnight I

        will go out into the midst of Egypt,

011:005 and all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die,

        from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sits on his throne, even to

        the firstborn of the female servant who is behind the mill;

        and all the firstborn of livestock.

011:006 There shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt,

        such as there has not been, nor shall be any more.

011:007 But against any of the children of Israel a dog won't

        even bark or move its tongue, against man or animal;

        that you may know that Yahweh makes a distinction between

        the Egyptians and Israel.

011:008 All these your servants shall come down to me, and bow down

        themselves to me, saying, "Get out, with all the people

        who follow you;" and after that I will go out.'"

        He went out from Pharaoh in hot anger.

011:009 Yahweh said to Moses, "Pharaoh won't listen to you, that my

        wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt."

011:010 Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh, and Yahweh

        hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he didn't let the children

        of Israel go out of his land.

012:001 Yahweh spoke to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying,

012:002 "This month shall be to you the beginning of months.

        It shall be the first month of the year to you.

012:003 Speak to all the congregation of Israel, saying, 'On the tenth

        day of this month, they shall take to them every man a lamb,

        according to their fathers' houses, a lamb for a household;

012:004 and if the household be too little for a lamb, then he and

        his neighbor next to his house shall take one according

        to the number of the souls; according to what everyone can

        eat you shall make your count for the lamb.

012:005 Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male a year old.

        You shall take it from the sheep, or from the goats:

012:006 and you shall keep it until the fourteenth day of the same month;

        and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall

        kill it at evening.

012:007 They shall take some of the blood, and put it on the two doorposts

        and on the lintel, on the houses in which they shall eat it.

012:008 They shall eat the flesh in that night, roasted with fire,

        and unleavened bread.  They shall eat it with bitter herbs.

012:009 Don't eat it raw, nor boiled at all with water, but roasted

        with fire; with its head, its legs and its inner parts.

012:010 You shall let nothing of it remain until the morning;

        but that which remains of it until the morning you shall

        burn with fire.

012:011 This is how you shall eat it:  with your waist girded,

        your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand;

        and you shall eat it in haste:  it is Yahweh's Passover.

012:012 For I will go through the land of Egypt in that night, and will strike

        all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and animal.

        Against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgments:

        I am Yahweh.

012:013 The blood shall be to you for a token on the houses where you are:

        and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and there

        shall no plague be on you to destroy you, when I strike

        the land of Egypt.

012:014 This day shall be to you for a memorial, and you shall keep

        it a feast to Yahweh:  throughout your generations you shall

        keep it a feast by an ordinance forever.

012:015 "'Seven days shall you eat unleavened bread; even the first

        day you shall put away yeast out of your houses, for whoever

        eats leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day,

        that soul shall be cut off from Israel.

012:016 In the first day there shall be to you a holy convocation,

        and in the seventh day a holy convocation; no manner of work

        shall be done in them, except that which every man must eat,

        that only may be done by you.

012:017 You shall observe the feast of unleavened bread; for in this

        same day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt:

        therefore shall you observe this day throughout your generations

        by an ordinance forever.

012:018 In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at evening,

        you shall eat unleavened bread, until the twenty first day

        of the month at evening.

012:019 Seven days shall there be no yeast found in your houses,

        for whoever eats that which is leavened, that soul shall be cut

        off from the congregation of Israel, whether he be a foreigner,

        or one who is born in the land.

012:020 You shall eat nothing leavened.  In all your habitations you

        shall eat unleavened bread.'"

012:021 Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said to them,

        "Draw out, and take lambs according to your families,

        and kill the Passover.

012:022 You shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood that

        is in the basin, and strike the lintel and the two doorposts

        with the blood that is in the basin; and none of you shall

        go out of the door of his house until the morning.

012:023 For Yahweh will pass through to strike the Egyptians; and when

        he sees the blood on the lintel, and on the two doorposts,

        Yahweh will pass over the door, and will not allow the destroyer

        to come in to your houses to strike you.

012:024 You shall observe this thing for an ordinance to you and to

        your sons forever.

012:025 It shall happen when you have come to the land which Yahweh

        will give you, according as he has promised, that you shall

        keep this service.

012:026 It will happen, when your children ask you, 'What do you mean

        by this service?'

012:027 that you shall say, 'It is the sacrifice of Yahweh's Passover,

        who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt,

        when he struck the Egyptians, and spared our houses.'"

        The people bowed their heads and worshiped.

012:028 The children of Israel went and did so; as Yahweh had commanded

        Moses and Aaron, so they did.

012:029 It happened at midnight, that Yahweh struck all the firstborn

        in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sat on his

        throne to the firstborn of the captive who was in the dungeon;

        and all the firstborn of livestock.

012:030 Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants,

        and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt,

        for there was not a house where there was not one dead.

012:031 He called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, "Rise up,

        get out from among my people, both you and the children of Israel;

        and go, serve Yahweh, as you have said!

012:032 Take both your flocks and your herds, as you have said,

        and be gone; and bless me also!"

012:033 The Egyptians were urgent with the people, to send them out

        of the land in haste, for they said, "We are all dead men."

012:034 The people took their dough before it was leavened, their kneading

        troughs being bound up in their clothes on their shoulders.

012:035 The children of Israel did according to the word of Moses;

        and they asked of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels

        of gold, and clothing.

012:036 Yahweh gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians,

        so that they let them have what they asked.

        They despoiled the Egyptians.

012:037 The children of Israel traveled from Rameses to Succoth,

        about six hundred thousand on foot who were men, besides children.

012:038 A mixed multitude went up also with them, with flocks, herds,

        and even very much livestock.

012:039 They baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought

        forth out of Egypt; for it wasn't leavened, because they

        were thrust out of Egypt, and couldn't wait, neither had they

        prepared for themselves any food.

012:040 Now the time that the children of Israel lived in Egypt was

        four hundred thirty years.

012:041 It happened at the end of four hundred thirty years,

        even the same day it happened, that all the armies of Yahweh

        went out from the land of Egypt.

012:042 It is a night to be much observed to Yahweh for bringing them

        out from the land of Egypt.  This is that night of Yahweh,

        to be much observed of all the children of Israel

        throughout their generations.

012:043 Yahweh said to Moses and Aaron, "This is the ordinance

        of the Passover.  There shall no foreigner eat of it,

012:044 but every man's servant who is bought for money, when you

        have circumcised him, then shall he eat of it.

012:045 A foreigner and a hired servant shall not eat of it.

012:046 In one house shall it be eaten; you shall not carry forth

        anything of the flesh abroad out of the house; neither shall

        you break a bone of it.

012:047 All the congregation of Israel shall keep it.

012:048 When a stranger shall live as a foreigner with you,

        and will keep the Passover to Yahweh, let all his males

        be circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it;

        and he shall be as one who is born in the land:

        but no uncircumcised person shall eat of it.

012:049 One law shall be to him who is born at home, and to the stranger

        who lives as a foreigner among you."

012:050 Thus did all the children of Israel.  As Yahweh commanded

        Moses and Aaron, so they did.

012:051 It happened the same day, that Yahweh brought the children

        of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies.

013:001 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

013:002 "Sanctify to me all of the firstborn, whatever opens the womb

        among the children of Israel, both of man and of animal.

        It is mine."

013:003 Moses said to the people, "Remember this day, in which you

        came out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by

        strength of hand Yahweh brought you out from this place.

        No leavened bread shall be eaten.

013:004 This day you go forth in the month Abib.

013:005 It shall be, when Yahweh shall bring you into the land of

        the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Hivite,

        and the Jebusite, which he swore to your fathers to give you,

        a land flowing with milk and honey, that you shall keep this

        service in this month.

013:006 Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, and in the seventh

        day shall be a feast to Yahweh.

013:007 Unleavened bread shall be eaten throughout the seven days;

        and no leavened bread shall be seen with you, neither shall

        there be yeast seen with you, in all your borders.

013:008 You shall tell your son in that day, saying, 'It is because of

        that which Yahweh did for me when I came forth out of Egypt.'

013:009 It shall be for a sign to you on your hand, and for a memorial

        between your eyes, that the law of Yahweh may be in your mouth;

        for with a strong hand Yahweh has brought you out of Egypt.

013:010 You shall therefore keep this ordinance in its season from

        year to year.

013:011 "It shall be, when Yahweh shall bring you into the land

        of the Canaanite, as he swore to you and to your fathers,

        and shall give it you,

013:012 that you shall set apart to Yahweh all that opens the womb,

        and every firstborn which you have that comes from an animal.

        The males shall be Yahweh's.

013:013 Every firstborn of a donkey you shall redeem with a lamb;

        and if you will not redeem it, then you shall break its neck;

        and you shall redeem all the firstborn of man among your sons.

013:014 It shall be, when your son asks you in time to come, saying,

        'What is this?' that you shall tell him, 'By strength of hand

        Yahweh brought us out from Egypt, from the house of bondage;

013:015 and it happened, when Pharaoh would hardly let us go,

        that Yahweh killed all the firstborn in the land of Egypt,

        both the firstborn of man, and the firstborn of animal.

        Therefore I sacrifice to Yahweh all that opens the womb,

        being males; but all the firstborn of my sons I redeem.'

013:016 It shall be for a sign on your hand, and for symbols between

        your eyes:  for by strength of hand Yahweh brought us forth

        out of Egypt."

013:017 It happened, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that God

        didn't lead them by the way of the land of the Philistines,

        although that was near; for God said, "Lest perhaps the people

        change their minds when they see war, and they return to Egypt;"

013:018 but God led the people around by the way of the wilderness

        by the Red Sea{or, Sea of Reeds}; and the children of Israel

        went up armed out of the land of Egypt.

013:019 Moses took the bones of Joseph with him, for he had made

        the children of Israel swear, saying, "God will surely visit you,

        and you shall carry up my bones away from here with you."

013:020 They took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in Etham,

        in the edge of the wilderness.

013:021 Yahweh went before them by day in a pillar of cloud,

        to lead them on their way, and by night in a pillar of fire,

        to give them light, that they might go by day and by night:

013:022 the pillar of cloud by day, and the pillar of fire by night,

        didn't depart from before the people.

014:001 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

014:002 "Speak to the children of Israel, that they turn back and encamp

        before Pihahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, before Baal Zephon.

        You shall encamp opposite it by the sea.

014:003 Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, 'They are entangled

        in the land.  The wilderness has shut them in.'

014:004 I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and he will follow after them;

        and I will get honor over Pharaoh, and over all his armies;

        and the Egyptians shall know that I am Yahweh."

        They did so.

014:005 It was told the king of Egypt that the people had fled;

        and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was changed

        towards the people, and they said, "What is this we have done,

        that we have let Israel go from serving us?"

014:006 He made ready his chariot, and took his army with him;

014:007 and he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots

        of Egypt, and captains over all of them.

014:008 Yahweh hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt,

        and he pursued after the children of Israel; for the children

        of Israel went out with a high hand.

014:009 The Egyptians pursued after them:  all the horses and chariots

        of Pharaoh, his horsemen, and his army; and overtook them

        encamping by the sea, beside Pihahiroth, before Baal Zephon.

014:010 When Pharaoh drew near, the children of Israel lifted up

        their eyes, and behold, the Egyptians were marching after them;

        and they were very afraid.  The children of Israel cried

        out to Yahweh.

014:011 They said to Moses, "Because there were no graves in Egypt,

        have you taken us away to die in the wilderness?

        Why have you treated us this way, to bring us forth out of Egypt?

014:012 Isn't this the word that we spoke to you in Egypt, saying,

        'Leave us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians?'  For it

        were better for us to serve the Egyptians, than that we

        should die in the wilderness."

014:013 Moses said to the people, "Don't be afraid.  Stand still, and see

        the salvation of Yahweh, which he will work for you today:

        for the Egyptians whom you have seen today, you shall never

        see them again.

014:014 Yahweh will fight for you, and you shall be still."

014:015 Yahweh said to Moses, "Why do you cry to me?  Speak to the children

        of Israel, that they go forward.

014:016 Lift up your rod, and stretch out your hand over the sea,

        and divide it:  and the children of Israel shall go into

        the midst of the sea on dry ground.

014:017 I, behold, I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians,

        and they shall go in after them:  and I will get myself honor

        over Pharaoh, and over all his armies, over his chariots,

        and over his horsemen.

014:018 The Egyptians shall know that I am Yahweh, when I have

        gotten myself honor over Pharaoh, over his chariots,

        and over his horsemen."

014:019 The angel of God, who went before the camp of Israel,

        moved and went behind them; and the pillar of cloud moved

        from before them, and stood behind them.

014:020 It came between the camp of Egypt and the camp of Israel; and there

        was the cloud and the darkness, yet gave it light by night:

        and the one didn't come near the other all the night.

014:021 Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and Yahweh caused

        the sea to go back by a strong east wind all the night,

        and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided.

014:022 The children of Israel went into the midst of the sea on

        the dry ground, and the waters were a wall to them on their

        right hand, and on their left.

014:023 The Egyptians pursued, and went in after them into the midst

        of the sea:  all of Pharaoh's horses, his chariots,

        and his horsemen.

014:024 It happened in the morning watch, that Yahweh looked out on

        the Egyptian army through the pillar of fire and of cloud,

        and confused the Egyptian army.

014:025 He took off their chariot wheels, and they drove them heavily;

        so that the Egyptians said, "Let's flee from the face of Israel,

        for Yahweh fights for them against the Egyptians!"

014:026 Yahweh said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand over the sea,

        that the waters may come again on the Egyptians, on their chariots,

        and on their horsemen."

014:027 Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and the sea returned

        to its strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians

        fled against it.  Yahweh overthrew the Egyptians in the midst

        of the sea.

014:028 The waters returned, and covered the chariots and the horsemen,

        even all Pharaoh's army that went in after them into the sea.

        There remained not so much as one of them.

014:029 But the children of Israel walked on dry land in the midst of

        the sea, and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand,

        and on their left.

014:030 Thus Yahweh saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians;

        and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the seashore.

014:031 Israel saw the great work which Yahweh did to the Egyptians,

        and the people feared Yahweh; and they believed in Yahweh,

        and in his servant Moses.

015:001 Then Moses and the children of Israel sang this song to Yahweh,

        and said, "I will sing to Yahweh, for he has triumphed gloriously.

        The horse and his rider he has thrown into the sea.

015:002 Yah is my strength and song.  He has become my salvation.

        This is my God, and I will praise him; my father's God,

        and I will exalt him.

015:003 Yahweh is a man of war.  Yahweh is his name.

015:004 He has cast Pharaoh's chariots and his army into the sea.

        His chosen captains are sunk in the Red Sea{or, Sea of Reeds}.

015:005 The deeps cover them.  They went down into the depths

        like a stone.

015:006 Your right hand, Yahweh, is glorious in power.

        Your right hand, Yahweh, dashes the enemy in pieces.

015:007 In the greatness of your excellency, you overthrow those

        who rise up against you.  You send forth your wrath.

        It consumes them as stubble.

015:008 With the blast of your nostrils, the waters were piled up.

        The floods stood upright as a heap.  The deeps were congealed

        in the heart of the sea.

015:009 The enemy said, 'I will pursue.  I will overtake.

        I will divide the spoil.  My desire shall be satisfied on them.

        I will draw my sword, my hand shall destroy them.'

015:010 You blew with your wind.  The sea covered them.

        They sank like lead in the mighty waters.

015:011 Who is like you, Yahweh, among the gods?  Who is like you,

        glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders?

015:012 You stretched out your right hand.  The earth swallowed them.

015:013 "You, in your loving kindness, have led the people that you

        have redeemed.  You have guided them in your strength

        to your holy habitation.

015:014 The peoples have heard.  They tremble.  Pangs have taken hold

        on the inhabitants of Philistia.

015:015 Then the chiefs of Edom were dismayed.  Trembling takes hold

        of the mighty men of Moab.  All the inhabitants of Canaan

        are melted away.

015:016 Terror and dread falls on them.  By the greatness of your arm

        they are as still as a stone--until your people pass over,

        Yahweh, until the people pass over who you have purchased.

015:017 You shall bring them in, and plant them in the mountain

        of your inheritance, the place, Yahweh, which you have made

        for yourself to dwell in; the sanctuary, Lord, which your

        hands have established.

015:018 Yahweh shall reign forever and ever."

015:019 For the horses of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with

        his horsemen into the sea, and Yahweh brought back the waters

        of the sea on them; but the children of Israel walked on dry

        land in the midst of the sea.

015:020 Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a tambourine

        in her hand; and all the women went out after her with tambourines

        and with dances.

015:021 Miriam answered them, "Sing to Yahweh, for he has

        triumphed gloriously.  The horse and his rider he has thrown

        into the sea."

015:022 Moses led Israel onward from the Red Sea{or, Sea of Reeds},

        and they went out into the wilderness of Shur; and they went

        three days in the wilderness, and found no water.

015:023 When they came to Marah, they couldn't drink from the waters

        of Marah, for they were bitter.  Therefore the name of it

        was called Marah.{Marah means bitter.}

015:024 The people murmured against Moses, saying, "What shall we drink?"

015:025 Then he cried to Yahweh.  Yahweh showed him a tree, and he threw

        it into the waters, and the waters were made sweet.

        There he made a statute and an ordinance for them, and there

        he tested them;

015:026 and he said, "If you will diligently listen to the voice of

        Yahweh your God, and will do that which is right in his eyes,

        and will pay attention to his commandments, and keep all

        his statutes, I will put none of the diseases on you, which I

        have put on the Egyptians; for I am Yahweh who heals you."

015:027 They came to Elim, where there were twelve springs of water,

        and seventy palm trees:  and they encamped there by the waters.

016:001 They took their journey from Elim, and all the congregation

        of the children of Israel came to the wilderness of Sin,

        which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second

        month after their departing out of the land of Egypt.

016:002 The whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured

        against Moses and against Aaron in the wilderness;

016:003 and the children of Israel said to them, "We wish that we

        had died by the hand of Yahweh in the land of Egypt,

        when we sat by the meat pots, when we ate our fill of bread,

        for you have brought us out into this wilderness, to kill

        this whole assembly with hunger."

016:004 Then said Yahweh to Moses, "Behold, I will rain bread from

        the sky for you, and the people shall go out and gather

        a day's portion every day, that I may test them, whether they

        will walk in my law, or not.

016:005 It shall come to pass on the sixth day, that they shall prepare

        that which they bring in, and it shall be twice as much

        as they gather daily."

016:006 Moses and Aaron said to all the children of Israel, "At evening,

        then you shall know that Yahweh has brought you out from

        the land of Egypt;

016:007 and in the morning, then you shall see the glory of Yahweh;

        because he hears your murmurings against Yahweh.

        Who are we, that you murmur against us?"

016:008 Moses said, "Now Yahweh shall give you meat to eat in the evening,

        and in the morning bread to satisfy you; because Yahweh hears

        your murmurings which you murmur against him.  And who are we?

        Your murmurings are not against us, but against Yahweh."

016:009 Moses said to Aaron, "Tell all the congregation of the

        children of Israel, 'Come near before Yahweh, for he has

        heard your murmurings.'"

016:010 It happened, as Aaron spoke to the whole congregation of the

        children of Israel, that they looked toward the wilderness,

        and behold, the glory of Yahweh appeared in the cloud.

016:011 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

016:012 "I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel.

        Speak to them, saying, 'At evening you shall eat meat,

        and in the morning you shall be filled with bread:

        and you shall know that I am Yahweh your God.'"

016:013 It happened at evening that quail came up and covered the camp;

        and in the morning the dew lay around the camp.

016:014 When the dew that lay had gone, behold, on the surface of

        the wilderness was a small round thing, small as the frost

        on the ground.

016:015 When the children of Israel saw it, they said one to another,

        "What is it?"  For they didn't know what it was.

        Moses said to them, "It is the bread which Yahweh has given

        you to eat."

016:016 This is the thing which Yahweh has commanded:

        "Gather of it everyone according to his eating; an omer a head,

        according to the number of your persons, shall you take it,

        every man for those who are in his tent."

016:017 The children of Israel did so, and gathered some more, some less.

016:018 When they measured it with an omer, he who gathered much

        had nothing over, and he who gathered little had no lack.

        They gathered every man according to his eating.

016:019 Moses said to them, "Let no one leave of it until the morning."

016:020 Notwithstanding they didn't listen to Moses, but some of them left

        of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and became foul:

        and Moses was angry with them.

016:021 They gathered it morning by morning, everyone according

        to his eating.  When the sun grew hot, it melted.

016:022 It happened that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread,

        two omers for each one, and all the rulers of the congregation

        came and told Moses.

016:023 He said to them, "This is that which Yahweh has spoken,

        'Tomorrow is a solemn rest, a holy Sabbath to Yahweh.

        Bake that which you want to bake, and boil that which you

        want to boil; and all that remains over lay up for yourselves

        to be kept until the morning.'"

016:024 They laid it up until the morning, as Moses asked, and it

        didn't become foul, neither was there any worm in it.

016:025 Moses said, "Eat that today, for today is a Sabbath to Yahweh.

        Today you shall not find it in the field.

016:026 Six days you shall gather it, but on the seventh day is the Sabbath.

        In it there shall be none."

016:027 It happened on the seventh day, that some of the people went

        out to gather, and they found none.

016:028 Yahweh said to Moses, "How long do you refuse to keep my

        commandments and my laws?

016:029 Behold, because Yahweh has given you the Sabbath,

        therefore he gives you on the sixth day the bread of two days.

        Everyone stay in his place.  Let no one go out of his place

        on the seventh day."

016:030 So the people rested on the seventh day.

016:031 The house of Israel called the name of it Manna,{"Manna"

        means "What is it?"} and it was like coriander seed, white;

        and its taste was like wafers with honey.

016:032 Moses said, "This is the thing which Yahweh has commanded,

        'Let an omer-full of it be kept throughout your generations,

        that they may see the bread with which I fed you in the wilderness,

        when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt.'"

016:033 Moses said to Aaron, "Take a pot, and put an omer-full

        of manna in it, and lay it up before Yahweh, to be kept

        throughout your generations."

016:034 As Yahweh commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony,

        to be kept.

016:035 The children of Israel ate the manna forty years, until they

        came to an inhabited land.  They ate the manna until they

        came to the borders of the land of Canaan.

016:036 Now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah.

017:001 All the congregation of the children of Israel traveled

        from the wilderness of Sin, by their journeys, according to

        Yahweh's commandment, and encamped in Rephidim; but there

        was no water for the people to drink.

017:002 Therefore the people quarreled with Moses, and said, "Give us water

        to drink."  Moses said to them, "Why do you quarrel with me?

        Why do you test Yahweh?"

017:003 The people were thirsty for water there; and the people murmured

        against Moses, and said, "Why have you brought us up out of Egypt,

        to kill us, our children, and our livestock with thirst?"

017:004 Moses cried to Yahweh, saying, "What shall I do with these people?

        They are almost ready to stone me."

017:005 Yahweh said to Moses, "Walk on before the people, and take

        the elders of Israel with you, and take the rod in your hand

        with which you struck the Nile, and go.

017:006 Behold, I will stand before you there on the rock in Horeb.

        You shall strike the rock, and water will come out of it,

        that the people may drink."  Moses did so in the sight

        of the elders of Israel.

017:007 He called the name of the place Massah,{Massah means testing.}

        and Meribah,{Meribah means quarreling.} because the children

        of Israel quarreled, and because they tested Yahweh, saying,

        "Is Yahweh among us, or not?"

017:008 Then Amalek came and fought with Israel in Rephidim.

017:009 Moses said to Joshua, "Choose men for us, and go out,

        fight with Amalek.  Tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill

        with God's rod in my hand."

017:010 So Joshua did as Moses had told him, and fought with Amalek;

        and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill.

017:011 It happened, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed;

        and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed.

017:012 But Moses' hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it

        under him, and he sat on it.  Aaron and Hur held up his hands,

        the one on the one side, and the other on the other side.

        His hands were steady until sunset.

017:013 Joshua defeated Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword.

017:014 Yahweh said to Moses, "Write this for a memorial in a book,

        and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua:  that I will utterly

        blot out the memory of Amalek from under the sky."

017:015 Moses built an altar, and called the name of it Yahweh

        our Banner.{Hebrew, Yahweh Nissi}

017:016 He said, "Yah has sworn:  'Yahweh will have war with Amalek

        from generation to generation.'"

018:001 Now Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses' father-in-law, heard of

        all that God had done for Moses, and for Israel his people,

        how that Yahweh had brought Israel out of Egypt.

018:002 Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, received Zipporah, Moses' wife,

        after he had sent her away,

018:003 and her two sons.  The name of one son was Gershom,{"Gershom"

        sounds like the Hebrew for "an alien there."} for Moses said,

        "I have lived as a foreigner in a foreign land".

018:004 The name of the other was Eliezer,{Eliezer means "God is my

        helper."} for he said, "My father's God was my help and delivered

        me from Pharaoh's sword."

018:005 Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, came with his sons and his

        wife to Moses into the wilderness where he was encamped,

        at the Mountain of God.

018:006 He said to Moses, I, your father-in-law Jethro, have come

        to you with your wife, and her two sons with her.

018:007 Moses went out to meet his father-in-law, and bowed and kissed him.

        They asked each other of their welfare, and they came

        into the tent.

018:008 Moses told his father-in-law all that Yahweh had done to Pharaoh

        and to the Egyptians for Israel's sake, all the hardships

        that had come on them on the way, and how Yahweh delivered them.

018:009 Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which Yahweh had done

        to Israel, in that he had delivered them out of the hand

        of the Egyptians.

018:010 Jethro said, "Blessed be Yahweh, who has delivered you out

        of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh;

        who has delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians.

018:011 Now I know that Yahweh is greater than all gods because of

        the thing in which they dealt arrogantly against them."

018:012 Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, took a burnt offering and sacrifices

        for God.  Aaron came with all of the elders of Israel,

        to eat bread with Moses' father-in-law before God.

018:013 It happened on the next day, that Moses sat to judge the people,

        and the people stood around Moses from the morning to the evening.

018:014 When Moses' father-in-law saw all that he did to the people,

        he said, "What is this thing that you do for the people?

        Why do you sit alone, and all the people stand around you

        from morning to evening?"

018:015 Moses said to his father-in-law, "Because the people come

        to me to inquire of God.

018:016 When they have a matter, they come to me, and I judge between a man

        and his neighbor, and I make them know the statutes of God,

        and his laws."

018:017 Moses' father-in-law said to him, "The thing that you do

        is not good.

018:018 You will surely wear away, both you, and this people

        that is with you; for the thing is too heavy for you.

        You are not able to perform it yourself alone.

018:019 Listen now to my voice.  I will give you counsel, and God

        be with you.  You represent the people before God, and bring

        the causes to God.

018:020 You shall teach them the statutes and the laws, and shall

        show them the way in which they must walk, and the work

        that they must do.

018:021 Moreover you shall provide out of all the people able men,

        such as fear God:  men of truth, hating unjust gain; and place

        such over them, to be rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds,

        rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.

018:022 Let them judge the people at all times.  It shall be that every

        great matter they shall bring to you, but every small matter

        they shall judge themselves.  So shall it be easier for you,

        and they shall share the load with you.

018:023 If you will do this thing, and God commands you so, then you

        will be able to endure, and all of these people also will go

        to their place in peace."

018:024 So Moses listened to the voice of his father-in-law, and did

        all that he had said.

018:025 Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads

        over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds,

        rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.

018:026 They judged the people at all times.  They brought the hard

        causes to Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves.

018:027 Moses let his father-in-law depart, and he went his way into

        his own land.

019:001 In the third month after the children of Israel had gone

        forth out of the land of Egypt, on that same day they came

        into the wilderness of Sinai.

019:002 When they had departed from Rephidim, and had come to

        the wilderness of Sinai, they encamped in the wilderness;

        and there Israel encamped before the mountain.

019:003 Moses went up to God, and Yahweh called to him out of the mountain,

        saying, "This is what you shall tell the house of Jacob,

        and tell the children of Israel:

019:004 'You have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I bore

        you on eagles' wings, and brought you to myself.

019:005 Now therefore, if you will indeed obey my voice, and keep my covenant,

        then you shall be my own possession from among all peoples;

        for all the earth is mine;

019:006 and you shall be to me a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation.'

        These are the words which you shall speak to the children

        of Israel."

019:007 Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and set

        before them all these words which Yahweh commanded him.

019:008 All the people answered together, and said, "All that Yahweh

        has spoken we will do."  Moses reported the words of the

        people to Yahweh.

019:009 Yahweh said to Moses, "Behold, I come to you in a thick cloud,

        that the people may hear when I speak with you, and may also believe

        you forever."  Moses told the words of the people to Yahweh.

019:010 Yahweh said to Moses, "Go to the people, and sanctify them

        today and tomorrow, and let them wash their garments,

019:011 and be ready against the third day; for on the third day Yahweh

        will come down in the sight of all the people on Mount Sinai.

019:012 You shall set bounds to the people round about, saying, 'Be careful

        that you don't go up onto the mountain, or touch its border.

        Whoever touches the mountain shall be surely put to death.

019:013 No hand shall touch him, but he shall surely be stoned or

        shot through; whether it is animal or man, he shall not live.'

        When the trumpet sounds long, they shall come up to the mountain."

019:014 Moses went down from the mountain to the people, and sanctified

        the people; and they washed their clothes.

019:015 He said to the people, "Be ready by the third day.

        Don't have sexual relations with a woman."

019:016 It happened on the third day, when it was morning,

        that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud

        on the mountain, and the sound of an exceedingly loud trumpet;

        and all the people who were in the camp trembled.

019:017 Moses led the people out of the camp to meet God; and they

        stood at the lower part of the mountain.

019:018 Mount Sinai, the whole of it, smoked, because Yahweh descended

        on it in fire; and its smoke ascended like the smoke of a furnace,

        and the whole mountain quaked greatly.

019:019 When the sound of the trumpet grew louder and louder, Moses spoke,

        and God answered him by a voice.

019:020 Yahweh came down on Mount Sinai, to the top of the mountain.

        Yahweh called Moses to the top of the mountain, and Moses went up.

019:021 Yahweh said to Moses, "Go down, charge the people, lest they

        break through to Yahweh to gaze, and many of them perish.

019:022 Let the priests also, who come near to Yahweh, sanctify themselves,

        lest Yahweh break forth on them."

019:023 Moses said to Yahweh, "The people can't come up to Mount Sinai,

        for you charged us, saying, 'Set bounds around the mountain,

        and sanctify it.'"

019:024 Yahweh said to him, "Go down and you shall bring Aaron up with you,

        but don't let the priests and the people break through to come

        up to Yahweh, lest he break forth on them."

019:025 So Moses went down to the people, and told them.

020:001 God{After "God," the Hebrew has the two letters "Aleph Tav"

        (the first and last letters of the Hebrew alphabet), not as a word,

        but as a grammatical marker.} spoke all these words, saying,

020:002 "I am Yahweh your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt,

        out of the house of bondage.

020:003 You shall have no other gods before me.

020:004 "You shall not make for yourselves an idol, nor any image of anything

        that is in the heavens above, or that is in the earth beneath,

        or that is in the water under the earth:

020:005 you shall not bow yourself down to them, nor serve them,

        for I, Yahweh your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity

        of the fathers on the children, on the third and on the fourth

        generation of those who hate me,

020:006 and showing loving kindness to thousands of those who love me

        and keep my commandments.

020:007 "You shall not take the name of Yahweh your God in vain,

        for Yahweh will not hold him guiltless who takes his name in vain.

020:008 "Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.

020:009 You shall labor six days, and do all your work,

020:010 but the seventh day is a Sabbath to Yahweh your God.

        You shall not do any work in it, you, nor your son,

        nor your daughter, your male servant, nor your female servant,

        nor your livestock, nor your stranger who is within your gates;

020:011 for in six days Yahweh made heaven and earth, the sea,

        and all that is in them, and rested the seventh day;

        therefore Yahweh blessed the Sabbath day, and made it holy.

020:012 "Honor your father and your mother, that your days may be long

        in the land which Yahweh your God gives you.

020:013 "You shall not murder.

020:014 "You shall not commit adultery.

020:015 "You shall not steal.

020:016 "You shall not give false testimony against your neighbor.

020:017 "You shall not covet your neighbor's house.  You shall

        not covet your neighbor's wife, nor his male servant,

        nor his female servant, nor his ox, nor his donkey,

        nor anything that is your neighbor's."

020:018 All the people perceived the thunderings, the lightnings,

        the sound of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking.

        When the people saw it, they trembled, and stayed at a distance.

020:019 They said to Moses, "Speak with us yourself, and we will listen;

        but don't let God speak with us, lest we die."

020:020 Moses said to the people, "Don't be afraid, for God has

        come to test you, and that his fear may be before you,

        that you won't sin."

020:021 The people stayed at a distance, and Moses drew near to the thick

        darkness where God was.

020:022 Yahweh said to Moses, "This is what you shall tell the children

        of Israel:  'You yourselves have seen that I have talked

        with you from heaven.

020:023 You shall most certainly not make alongside of me gods of silver,

        or gods of gold for yourselves.

020:024 You shall make an altar of earth for me, and shall sacrifice

        on it your burnt offerings and your peace offerings,

        your sheep and your oxen.  In every place where I record

        my name I will come to you and I will bless you.

020:025 If you make me an altar of stone, you shall not build

        it of hewn stones; for if you lift up your tool on it,

        you have polluted it.

020:026 Neither shall you go up by steps to my altar, that your nakedness

        may not be exposed to it.'

021:001 "Now these are the ordinances which you shall set before them.

021:002 "If you buy a Hebrew servant, he shall serve six years and in

        the seventh he shall go out free without paying anything.

021:003 If he comes in by himself, he shall go out by himself.

        If he is married, then his wife shall go out with him.

021:004 If his master gives him a wife and she bears him sons or daughters,

        the wife and her children shall be her master's, and he shall

        go out by himself.

021:005 But if the servant shall plainly say, 'I love my master,

        my wife, and my children.  I will not go out free;'

021:006 then his master shall bring him to God, and shall bring him

        to the door or to the doorpost, and his master shall bore

        his ear through with an awl, and he shall serve him for ever.

021:007 "If a man sells his daughter to be a female servant, she shall

        not go out as the male servants do.

021:008 If she doesn't please her master, who has married

        her to himself, then he shall let her be redeemed.

        He shall have no right to sell her to a foreign people,

        seeing he has dealt deceitfully with her.

021:009 If he marries her to his son, he shall deal with her after

        the manner of daughters.

021:010 If he takes another wife to himself, he shall not diminish

        her food, her clothing, and her marital rights.

021:011 If he doesn't do these three things for her, she may go free

        without paying any money.

021:012 "One who strikes a man so that he dies shall surely be

        put to death,

021:013 but not if it is unintentional, but God allows it to happen:

        then I will appoint you a place where he shall flee.

021:014 If a man schemes and comes presumptuously on his neighbor

        to kill him, you shall take him from my altar, that he may die.

021:015 "Anyone who attacks his father or his mother shall be surely

        put to death.

021:016 "Anyone who kidnaps someone and sells him, or if he is found

        in his hand, he shall surely be put to death.

021:017 "Anyone who curses his father or his mother shall surely

        be put to death.

021:018 "If men quarrel and one strikes the other with a stone,

        or with his fist, and he doesn't die, but is confined to bed;

021:019 if he rises again and walks around with his staff,

        then he who struck him shall be cleared:  only he shall pay

        for the loss of his time, and shall provide for his healing

        until he is thoroughly healed.

021:020 "If a man strikes his servant or his maid with a rod,

        and he dies under his hand, he shall surely be punished.

021:021 Notwithstanding, if he gets up after a day or two, he shall

        not be punished, for he is his property.

021:022 "If men fight and hurt a pregnant woman so that she gives

        birth prematurely, and yet no harm follows, he shall be surely

        fined as much as the woman's husband demands and the judges allow.

021:023 But if any harm follows, then you must take life for life,

021:024 eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,

021:025 burning for burning, wound for wound, and bruise for bruise.

021:026 "If a man strikes his servant's eye, or his maid's eye,

        and destroys it, he shall let him go free for his eye's sake.

021:027 If he strikes out his male servant's tooth, or his female

        servant's tooth, he shall let him go free for his tooth's sake.

021:028 "If a bull gores a man or a woman to death, the bull shall

        surely be stoned, and its flesh shall not be eaten;

        but the owner of the bull shall not be held responsible.

021:029 But if the bull had a habit of goring in the past, and it

        has been testified to its owner, and he has not kept it in,

        but it has killed a man or a woman, the bull shall be stoned,

        and its owner shall also be put to death.

021:030 If a ransom is laid on him, then he shall give for the redemption

        of his life whatever is laid on him.

021:031 Whether it has gored a son or has gored a daughter,

        according to this judgment it shall be done to him.

021:032 If the bull gores a male servant or a female servant,

        thirty shekels of silver shall be given to their master,

        and the ox shall be stoned.

021:033 "If a man opens a pit, or if a man digs a pit and doesn't cover it,

        and a bull or a donkey falls into it,

021:034 the owner of the pit shall make it good.  He shall give money

        to its owner, and the dead animal shall be his.

021:035 "If one man's bull injures another's, so that it dies,

        then they shall sell the live bull, and divide its price;

        and they shall also divide the dead animal.

021:036 Or if it is known that the bull was in the habit of goring

        in the past, and its owner has not kept it in, he shall surely

        pay bull for bull, and the dead animal shall be his own.

022:001 "If a man steals an ox or a sheep, and kills it, or sells it;

        he shall pay five oxen for an ox, and four sheep for a sheep.

022:002 If the thief is found breaking in, and is struck so that he dies,

        there shall be no guilt of bloodshed for him.

022:003 If the sun has risen on him, there shall be guilt of bloodshed

        for him; he shall make restitution.  If he has nothing,

        then he shall be sold for his theft.

022:004 If the stolen property is found in his hand alive, whether it

        is ox, donkey, or sheep, he shall pay double.

022:005 "If a man causes a field or vineyard to be eaten, and lets

        his animal loose, and it grazes in another man's field,

        he shall make restitution from the best of his own field,

        and from the best of his own vineyard.

022:006 "If fire breaks out, and catches in thorns so that the shocks

        of grain, or the standing grain, or the field are consumed;

        he who kindled the fire shall surely make restitution.

022:007 "If a man delivers to his neighbor money or stuff to keep,

        and it is stolen out of the man's house; if the thief is found,

        he shall pay double.

022:008 If the thief isn't found, then the master of the house shall

        come near to God, to find out if he hasn't put his hand

        to his neighbor's goods.

022:009 For every matter of trespass, whether it be for ox, for donkey,

        for sheep, for clothing, or for any kind of lost thing,

        about which one says, 'This is mine,' the cause of both parties

        shall come before God.  He whom God condemns shall pay double

        to his neighbor.

022:010 "If a man delivers to his neighbor a donkey, an ox, a sheep,

        or any animal to keep, and it dies or is injured, or driven away,

        no man seeing it;

022:011 the oath of Yahweh shall be between them both, whether he hasn't

        put his hand to his neighbor's goods; and the owner of it

        shall accept it, and he shall not make restitution.

022:012 But if it is stolen from him, he shall make restitution

        to the owner of it.

022:013 If it is torn in pieces, let him bring it for evidence.

        He shall not make good that which was torn.

022:014 "If a man borrows anything of his neighbor's, and it is injured,

        or dies, the owner of it not being with it, he shall

        surely make restitution.

022:015 If the owner of it is with it, he shall not make it good.

        If it is a leased thing, it came for its lease.

022:016 "If a man entices a virgin who isn't pledged to be married,

        and lies with her, he shall surely pay a dowry for her to

        be his wife.

022:017 If her father utterly refuses to give her to him, he shall

        pay money according to the dowry of virgins.

022:018 "You shall not allow a sorceress to live.

022:019 "Whoever has sex with an animal shall surely be put to death.

022:020 "He who sacrifices to any god, except to Yahweh only,

        shall be utterly destroyed.

022:021 "You shall not wrong an alien, neither shall you oppress him,

        for you were aliens in the land of Egypt.

022:022 "You shall not take advantage of any widow or fatherless child.

022:023 If you take advantage of them at all, and they cry at all to me,

        I will surely hear their cry;

022:024 and my wrath will grow hot, and I will kill you with the sword;

        and your wives shall be widows, and your children fatherless.

022:025 "If you lend money to any of my people with you who is poor,

        you shall not be to him as a creditor; neither shall you

        charge him interest.

022:026 If you take your neighbor's garment as collateral, you shall

        restore it to him before the sun goes down,

022:027 for that is his only covering, it is his garment for his skin.

        What would he sleep in?  It will happen, when he cries to me,

        that I will hear, for I am gracious.

022:028 "You shall not blaspheme God, nor curse a ruler of your people.

022:029 "You shall not delay to offer from your harvest and from

        the outflow of your presses.  "You shall give the firstborn

        of your sons to me.

022:030 You shall do likewise with your oxen and with your sheep.

        Seven days it shall be with its mother, then on the eighth

        day you shall give it me.

022:031 "You shall be holy men to me, therefore you shall not

        eat any flesh that is torn by animals in the field.

        You shall cast it to the dogs.

023:001 "You shall not spread a false report.  Don't join your hand

        with the wicked to be a malicious witness.

023:002 You shall not follow a crowd to do evil; neither shall you

        testify in court to side with a multitude to pervert justice;

023:003 neither shall you favor a poor man in his cause.

023:004 "If you meet your enemy's ox or his donkey going astray,

        you shall surely bring it back to him again.

023:005 If you see the donkey of him who hates you fallen down under

        his burden, don't leave him, you shall surely help him with it.

023:006 "You shall not deny justice to your poor people in their lawsuits.

023:007 "Keep far from a false charge, and don't kill the innocent

        and righteous:  for I will not justify the wicked.

023:008 "You shall take no bribe, for a bribe blinds those who have

        sight and perverts the words of the righteous.

023:009 "You shall not oppress an alien, for you know the heart of an alien,

        seeing you were aliens in the land of Egypt.

023:010 "For six years you shall sow your land, and shall gather

        in its increase,

023:011 but the seventh year you shall let it rest and lie fallow,

        that the poor of your people may eat; and what they leave

        the animal of the field shall eat.  In like manner you shall

        deal with your vineyard and with your olive grove.

023:012 "Six days you shall do your work, and on the seventh day you

        shall rest, that your ox and your donkey may have rest,

        and the son of your handmaid, and the alien may be refreshed.

023:013 "Be careful to do all things that I have said to you;

        and don't invoke the name of other gods, neither let them

        be heard out of your mouth.

023:014 "You shall observe a feast to me three times a year.

023:015 You shall observe the feast of unleavened bread.

        Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, as I commanded you,

        at the time appointed in the month Abib (for in it you came

        out from Egypt), and no one shall appear before me empty.

023:016 And the feast of harvest, the first fruits of your labors,

        which you sow in the field:  and the feast of harvest,

        at the end of the year, when you gather in your labors out

        of the field.

023:017 Three times in the year all your males shall appear before

        the Lord Yahweh.

023:018 "You shall not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread,

        neither shall the fat of my feast remain all night

        until the morning.

023:019 The first of the first fruits of your ground you shall bring

        into the house of Yahweh your God.  "You shall not boil a kid

        in its mother's milk.

023:020 "Behold, I send an angel before you, to keep you by the way,

        and to bring you into the place which I have prepared.

023:021 Pay attention to him, and listen to his voice.

        Don't provoke him, for he will not pardon your disobedience,

        for my name is in him.

023:022 But if you indeed listen to his voice, and do all that I speak,

        then I will be an enemy to your enemies, and an adversary

        to your adversaries.

023:023 For my angel shall go before you, and bring you in to the Amorite,

        the Hittite, the Perizzite, the Canaanite, the Hivite,

        and the Jebusite; and I will cut them off.

023:024 You shall not bow down to their gods, nor serve them,

        nor follow their practices, but you shall utterly overthrow

        them and demolish their pillars.

023:025 You shall serve Yahweh your God, and he will bless your bread

        and your water, and I will take sickness away from your midst.

023:026 No one will miscarry or be barren in your land.

        I will fulfill the number of your days.

023:027 I will send my terror before you, and will confuse all the people

        to whom you come, and I will make all your enemies turn

        their backs to you.

023:028 I will send the hornet before you, which will drive out the Hivite,

        the Canaanite, and the Hittite, from before you.

023:029 I will not drive them out from before you in one year,

        lest the land become desolate, and the animals of the field

        multiply against you.

023:030 Little by little I will drive them out from before you,

        until you have increased and inherit the land.

023:031 I will set your border from the Red Sea{or, Sea of Reeds} even to

        the sea of the Philistines, and from the wilderness to the River;

        for I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand,

        and you shall drive them out before you.

023:032 You shall make no covenant with them, nor with their gods.

023:033 They shall not dwell in your land, lest they make you sin

        against me, for if you serve their gods, it will surely

        be a snare to you."

024:001 He said to Moses, "Come up to Yahweh, you, and Aaron, Nadab,

        and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel; and worship

        from a distance.

024:002 Moses alone shall come near to Yahweh, but they shall not come near,

        neither shall the people go up with him."

024:003 Moses came and told the people all the words of Yahweh, and all

        the ordinances; and all the people answered with one voice,

        and said, "All the words which Yahweh has spoken will we do."

024:004 Moses wrote all the words of Yahweh, and rose up early

        in the morning, and built an altar under the mountain,

        and twelve pillars for the twelve tribes of Israel.

024:005 He sent young men of the children of Israel, who offered burnt

        offerings and sacrificed peace offerings of oxen to Yahweh.

024:006 Moses took half of the blood and put it in basins, and half

        of the blood he sprinkled on the altar.

024:007 He took the book of the covenant and read it in the hearing

        of the people, and they said, "All that Yahweh has spoken

        will we do, and be obedient."

024:008 Moses took the blood, and sprinkled it on the people,

        and said, "Look, this is the blood of the covenant,

        which Yahweh has made with you concerning all these words."

024:009 Then Moses, Aaron, Nadab, Abihu, and seventy of the elders

        of Israel went up.

024:010 They saw the God of Israel.  Under his feet was like a paved work

        of sapphire{or, lapis lazuli} stone, like the skies for clearness.

024:011 He didn't lay his hand on the nobles of the children of Israel.

        They saw God, and ate and drank.

024:012 Yahweh said to Moses, "Come up to me on the mountain,

        and stay here, and I will give you the tables of stone

        with the law and the commands that I have written, that you

        may teach them."

024:013 Moses rose up with Joshua, his servant, and Moses went up

        onto God's Mountain.

024:014 He said to the elders, "Wait here for us, until we come

        again to you.  Behold, Aaron and Hur are with you.

        Whoever is involved in a dispute can go to them."

024:015 Moses went up on the mountain, and the cloud covered the mountain.

024:016 The glory of Yahweh settled on Mount Sinai, and the cloud

        covered it six days.  The seventh day he called to Moses

        out of the midst of the cloud.

024:017 The appearance of the glory of Yahweh was like devouring fire on

        the top of the mountain in the eyes of the children of Israel.

024:018 Moses entered into the midst of the cloud, and went up

        on the mountain; and Moses was on the mountain forty days

        and forty nights.

025:001 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

025:002 "Speak to the children of Israel, that they take an offering for me.

        From everyone whose heart makes him willing you shall

        take my offering.

025:003 This is the offering which you shall take from them:

        gold, silver, brass,

025:004 blue, purple, scarlet, fine linen, goats' hair,

025:005 rams' skins dyed red, sea cow hides, acacia wood,

025:006 oil for the light, spices for the anointing oil and for

        the sweet incense,

025:007 onyx stones, and stones to be set for the ephod and

        for the breastplate.

025:008 Let them make me a sanctuary, that I may dwell among them.

025:009 According to all that I show you, the pattern of the tent,

        and the pattern of all of its furniture, even so you

        shall make it.

025:010 "They shall make an ark of acacia wood.  Its length shall

        be two and a half cubits, its breadth a cubit and a half,

        and a cubit and a half its height.

025:011 You shall overlay it with pure gold.  Inside and outside shall

        you overlay it, and shall make a gold molding around it.

025:012 You shall cast four rings of gold for it, and put them

        in its four feet.  Two rings shall be on the one side of it,

        and two rings on the other side of it.

025:013 You shall make poles of acacia wood, and overlay them with gold.

025:014 You shall put the poles into the rings on the sides of the ark

        to carry the ark.

025:015 The poles shall be in the rings of the ark.  They shall not

        be taken from it.

025:016 You shall put the testimony which I shall give you into the ark.

025:017 You shall make a mercy seat of pure gold.  Two and a half cubits

        shall be its length, and a cubit and a half its breadth.

025:018 You shall make two cherubim of hammered gold.  You shall make

        them at the two ends of the mercy seat.

025:019 Make one cherub at the one end, and one cherub at the other end.

        You shall make the cherubim on its two ends of one piece

        with the mercy seat.

025:020 The cherubim shall spread out their wings upward, covering the mercy

        seat with their wings, with their faces toward one another.

        The faces of the cherubim shall be toward the mercy seat.

025:021 You shall put the mercy seat on top of the ark, and in the ark

        you shall put the testimony that I will give you.

025:022 There I will meet with you, and I will tell you from above

        the mercy seat, from between the two cherubim which are

        on the ark of the testimony, all that I command you for

        the children of Israel.

025:023 "You shall make a table of acacia wood.  Two cubits shall

        be its length, and a cubit its breadth, and one and a half

        cubits its height.

025:024 You shall overlay it with pure gold, and make a gold

        molding around it.

025:025 You shall make a rim of a handbreadth around it.

        You shall make a golden molding on its rim around it.

025:026 You shall make four rings of gold for it, and put the rings

        in the four corners that are on its four feet.

025:027 the rings shall be close to the rim, for places for the poles

        to carry the table.

025:028 You shall make the poles of acacia wood, and overlay them

        with gold, that the table may be carried with them.

025:029 You shall make its dishes, its spoons, its ladles, and its bowls

        to pour out offerings with.  Of pure gold shall you make them.

025:030 You shall set bread of the presence on the table before me always.

025:031 "You shall make a lampstand of pure gold.  Of hammered work shall

        the lampstand be made, even its base, its shaft, its cups,

        its buds, and its flowers, shall be of one piece with it.

025:032 There shall be six branches going out of its sides:

        three branches of the lampstand out of its one side,

        and three branches of the lampstand out of its other side;

025:033 three cups made like almond blossoms in one branch, a bud

        and a flower; and three cups made like almond blossoms in

        the other branch, a bud and a flower, so for the six branches

        going out of the lampstand;

025:034 and in the lampstand four cups made like almond blossoms,

        its buds and its flowers;

025:035 and a bud under two branches of one piece with it, and a bud

        under two branches of one piece with it, and a bud under two

        branches of one piece with it, for the six branches going

        out of the lampstand.

025:036 Their buds and their branches shall be of one piece with it,

        the whole of it one beaten work of pure gold.

025:037 You shall make its lamps seven, and they shall light its lamps

        to give light to the space in front of it.

025:038 Its snuffers and its snuff dishes shall be of pure gold.

025:039 It shall be made of a talent of pure gold, with all

        these accessories.

025:040 See that you make them after their pattern, which has been

        shown to you on the mountain.

026:001 "Moreover you shall make the tent with ten curtains; of fine

        twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet, with cherubim.

        The work of the skillful workman you shall make them.

026:002 The length of each curtain shall be twenty-eight cubits,

        and the breadth of each curtain four cubits:  all the curtains

        shall have one measure.

026:003 Five curtains shall be coupled together one to another;

        and the other five curtains shall be coupled one to another.

026:004 You shall make loops of blue on the edge of the one curtain

        from the edge in the coupling; and likewise shall you make in

        the edge of the curtain that is outmost in the second coupling.

026:005 You shall make fifty loops in the one curtain, and you shall

        make fifty loops in the edge of the curtain that is in the

        second coupling.  The loops shall be opposite one to another.

026:006 You shall make fifty clasps of gold, and couple the curtains

        one to another with the clasps:  and the tent shall be a unit.

026:007 "You shall make curtains of goats' hair for a covering over the tent:

        eleven curtains shall you make them.

026:008 The length of each curtain shall be thirty cubits, and the breadth

        of each curtain four cubits:  the eleven curtains shall

        have one measure.

026:009 You shall couple five curtains by themselves, and six curtains

        by themselves, and shall double over the sixth curtain

        in the forefront of the tent.

026:010 You shall make fifty loops on the edge of the one curtain

        that is outmost in the coupling, and fifty loops on the edge

        of the curtain which is outmost in the second coupling.

026:011 You shall make fifty clasps of brass, and put the clasps into

        the loops, and couple the tent together, that it may be one.

026:012 The overhanging part that remains of the curtains of the tent,

        the half curtain that remains, shall hang over the back

        of the tent.

026:013 The cubit on the one side, and the cubit on the other side,

        of that which remains in the length of the curtains of the tent,

        shall hang over the sides of the tent on this side and on

        that side, to cover it.

026:014 You shall make a covering for the tent of rams' skins dyed red,

        and a covering of sea cow hides above.

026:015 "You shall make the boards for the tent of acacia wood, standing up.

026:016 Ten cubits shall be the length of a board, and one and a half

        cubits the breadth of each board.

026:017 There shall be two tenons in each board, joined to one another:

        thus shall you make for all the boards of the tent.

026:018 You shall make the boards for the tent, twenty boards for

        the south side southward.

026:019 You shall make forty sockets of silver under the twenty boards;

        two sockets under one board for its two tenons, and two sockets

        under another board for its two tenons.

026:024 They shall be double beneath, and in like manner they shall be entire

        to the top of it to one ring:  thus shall it be for them both;

        they shall be for the two corners.

026:025 There shall be eight boards, and their sockets of silver,

        sixteen sockets; two sockets under one board, and two sockets

        for the far part westward.

026:028 The middle bar in the midst of the boards shall pass through

        from end to end.

026:029 You shall overlay the boards with gold, and make their rings

        of gold for places for the bars:  and you shall overlay

        the bars with gold.

026:030 You shall set up the tent according to the way that it was shown

        to you on the mountain.

026:031 "You shall make a veil of blue, and purple, and scarlet,

        and fine twined linen, with cherubim.  The work of the skillful

        workman shall it be made.

026:032 You shall hang it on four pillars of acacia overlaid with gold;

        their hooks shall be of gold, on four sockets of silver.

026:033 You shall hang up the veil under the clasps, and shall

        bring the ark of the testimony in there within the veil:

        and the veil shall separate the holy place from the most

        holy for you.

026:034 You shall put the mercy seat on the ark of the testimony

        in the most holy place.

026:035 You shall set the table outside the veil, and the lampstand over

        against the table on the side of the tent toward the south:

        and you shall put the table on the north side.

026:036 "You shall make a screen for the door of the Tent, of blue,

        and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, the work

        of the embroiderer.

026:037 You shall make for the screen five pillars of acacia,

        and overlay them with gold:  their hooks shall be of gold:

        and you shall cast five sockets of brass for them.

027:001 "You shall make the altar of acacia wood, five cubits long,

        and five cubits broad; the altar shall be foursquare:

        its basins, its flesh hooks, and its fire pans:

        all its vessels you shall make of brass.

027:004 You shall make a grating for it of network of brass:

        and on the net you shall make four bronze rings in its four corners.

027:007 Its poles shall be put into the rings, and the poles shall

027:008 Hollow with planks shall you make it:  as it has been shown

        you on the mountain, so shall they make it.

027:009 "You shall make the court of the tent:  for the south side

        southward there shall be hangings for the court of fine twined

027:020 "You shall command the children of Israel, that they bring

        to you pure olive oil beaten for the light, to cause a lamp

        to burn continually.

027:021 In the tent of meeting, outside the veil which is before

        the testimony, Aaron and his sons shall keep it in order

        from evening to morning before Yahweh:  it shall be a

        statute forever throughout their generations on the behalf

        of the children of Israel.

028:001 "Bring Aaron your brother, and his sons with him, near to you

        from among the children of Israel, that he may minister to me

        in the priest's office, even Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar

        and Ithamar, Aaron's sons.

028:002 You shall make holy garments for Aaron your brother, for glory

        and for beauty.

028:003 You shall speak to all who are wise-hearted, whom I have filled

        with the spirit of wisdom, that they make Aaron's garments to

        sanctify him, that he may minister to me in the priest's office.

028:004 These are the garments which they shall make:  a breastplate,

        and an ephod, and a robe, and a coat of checker work,

        a turban, and a sash:  and they shall make holy garments

        for Aaron your brother, and his sons, that he may minister

        to me in the priest's office.

028:005 They shall take the gold, and the blue, and the purple,

        and the scarlet, and the fine linen.

028:006 "They shall make the ephod of gold, of blue, and purple, scarlet,

        and fine twined linen, the work of the skillful workman.

028:007 It shall have two shoulder straps joined to the two ends of it,

        that it may be joined together.

028:008 The skillfully woven band, which is on it, that is on him,

        shall be like its work and of the same piece; of gold, of blue,

        and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen.

028:009 You shall take two onyx stones, and engrave on them the names

        of the children of Israel:

028:010 six of their names on the one stone, and the names of the six

        that remain on the other stone, in the order of their birth.

028:011 With the work of an engraver in stone, like the engravings

        of a signet, shall you engrave the two stones, according to

        the names of the children of Israel:  you shall make them

        to be enclosed in settings of gold.

028:012 You shall put the two stones on the shoulder straps of the ephod,

        to be stones of memorial for the children of Israel:

        and Aaron shall bear their names before Yahweh on his two

        shoulders for a memorial.

028:013 You shall make settings of gold,

028:014 and two chains of pure gold; you shall make them like cords

        of braided work:  and you shall put the braided chains

        on the settings.

028:015 "You shall make a breastplate of judgment, the work of the

        skillful workman; like the work of the ephod you shall make it;

        of gold, of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen,

        shall you make it.

028:016 It shall be square and folded double; a span{A span is the length

        from the tip of the thumb to the tip of the little finger

        when the hand is stretched out (about 9 inches or 22.8 cm.)}

        shall be its length of it, and a span its breadth.

028:017 You shall set in it settings of stones, four rows of stones:

        a row of ruby, topaz, and beryl shall be the first row;

028:018 and the second row a turquoise, a sapphire{or, lapis lazuli},

        and an emerald;

028:019 and the third row a jacinth, an agate, and an amethyst;

028:020 and the fourth row a chrysolite, an onyx, and a jasper:

        they shall be enclosed in gold in their settings.

028:021 The stones shall be according to the names of the children

        of Israel, twelve, according to their names; like the engravings

        of a signet, everyone according to his name, they shall

        be for the twelve tribes.

028:022 You shall make on the breastplate chains like cords, of braided

        work of pure gold.

028:023 You shall make on the breastplate two rings of gold, and shall

        put the two rings on the two ends of the breastplate.

028:024 You shall put the two braided chains of gold in the two rings

        at the ends of the breastplate.

028:025 The other two ends of the two braided chains you shall put

        on the two settings, and put them on the shoulder straps

        of the ephod in the forepart of it.

028:026 You shall make two rings of gold, and you shall put them on

        the two ends of the breastplate, on its edge, which is toward

        the side of the ephod inward.

028:027 You shall make two rings of gold, and shall put them on the two

        shoulder straps of the ephod underneath, in the forepart of it,

        close by the coupling of it, above the skillfully woven band

        of the ephod.

028:028 They shall bind the breastplate by the rings of it to the rings

        of the ephod with a lace of blue, that it may be on the skillfully

        woven band of the ephod, and that the breastplate may not swing

        out from the ephod.

028:029 Aaron shall bear the names of the children of Israel in

        the breastplate of judgment on his heart, when he goes in to

        the holy place, for a memorial before Yahweh continually.

028:030 You shall put in the breastplate of judgment the Urim and the Thummim;

        and they shall be on Aaron's heart, when he goes in before Yahweh:

        and Aaron shall bear the judgment of the children of Israel

        on his heart before Yahweh continually.

028:031 "You shall make the robe of the ephod all of blue.

028:032 It shall have a hole for the head in the midst of it:

        it shall have a binding of woven work round about the hole of it,

        as it were the hole of a coat of mail, that it not be torn.

028:033 On its hem you shall make pomegranates of blue, and of purple,

        and of scarlet, around its hem; and bells of gold between

        them round about:

028:034 a golden bell and a pomegranate, a golden bell and a pomegranate,

        on the hem of the robe round about.

028:035 It shall be on Aaron to minister:  and the sound of it shall

        be heard when he goes in to the holy place before Yahweh,

        and when he comes out, that he not die.

028:036 "You shall make a plate of pure gold, and engrave on it,

        like the engravings of a signet, 'HOLY TO YAHWEH.'

028:037 You shall put it on a lace of blue, and it shall be on the sash;

        on the front of the sash it shall be.

028:038 It shall be on Aaron's forehead, and Aaron shall bear the iniquity

        of the holy things, which the children of Israel shall make holy

        in all their holy gifts; and it shall be always on his forehead,

        that they may be accepted before Yahweh.

028:039 You shall weave the coat in checker work of fine linen, and you

        shall make a turban of fine linen, and you shall make a sash,

        the work of the embroiderer.

028:040 "You shall make coats for Aaron's sons, and you shall make

        sashes for them and headbands shall you make for them,

        for glory and for beauty.

028:041 You shall put them on Aaron your brother, and on his sons with him,

        and shall anoint them, and consecrate them, and sanctify them,

        that they may minister to me in the priest's office.

028:042 You shall make them linen breeches to cover the flesh

        of their nakedness; from the waist even to the thighs

        they shall reach:

028:043 They shall be on Aaron, and on his sons, when they go in to

        the tent of meeting, or when they come near to the altar

        to minister in the holy place; that they don't bear iniquity,

        and die:  it shall be a statute forever to him and to his

        descendants after him.

029:001 "This is the thing that you shall do to them to make

        them holy, to minister to me in the priest's office:

        take one young bull and two rams without blemish,

029:002 unleavened bread, unleavened cakes mixed with oil,

        and unleavened wafers anointed with oil:  you shall make them

        of fine wheat flour.

029:003 You shall put them into one basket, and bring them in the basket,

        with the bull and the two rams.

029:004 You shall bring Aaron and his sons to the door of the tent

        of meeting, and shall wash them with water.

029:005 You shall take the garments, and put on Aaron the coat,

        the robe of the ephod, the ephod, and the breastplate,

        and dress him with the skillfully woven band of the ephod;

029:006 and you shall set the turban on his head, and put the holy

        crown on the turban.

029:007 Then you shall take the anointing oil, and pour it on his head,

        and anoint him.

029:008 You shall bring his sons, and put coats on them.

029:009 You shall dress them with belts, Aaron and his sons, and bind

        headbands on them:  and they shall have the priesthood

        by a perpetual statute:  and you shall consecrate Aaron

        and his sons.

029:010 "You shall bring the bull before the tent of meeting:

        and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands on the head

        of the bull.

029:011 You shall kill the bull before Yahweh, at the door of the

        tent of meeting.

029:012 You shall take of the blood of the bull, and put it on the horns

        of the altar with your finger; and you shall pour out all

        the blood at the base of the altar.

029:013 You shall take all the fat that covers the innards, the cover

        of the liver, the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them,

        and burn them on the altar.

029:014 But the flesh of the bull, and its skin, and its dung,

        you shall burn with fire outside of the camp:

        it is a sin offering.

029:015 "You shall also take the one ram; and Aaron and his sons shall

        lay their hands on the head of the ram.

029:016 You shall kill the ram, and you shall take its blood,

        and sprinkle it around on the altar.

029:017 You shall cut the ram into its pieces, and wash its innards,

        and its legs, and put them with its pieces, and with its head.

029:018 You shall burn the whole ram on the altar:  it is a burnt

        offering to Yahweh; it is a sweet savor, an offering made

        by fire to Yahweh.

029:019 "You shall take the other ram; and Aaron and his sons shall

        lay their hands on the head of the ram.

029:020 Then you shall kill the ram, and take some of its blood,

        and put it on the tip of the right ear of Aaron, and on

        the tip of the right ear of his sons, and on the thumb

        of their right hand, and on the big toe of their right foot,

        and sprinkle the blood on the altar round about.

029:021 You shall take of the blood that is on the altar, and of the

        anointing oil, and sprinkle it on Aaron, and on his garments,

        and on his sons, and on the garments of his sons with him:

        and he shall be made holy, and his garments, and his sons,

        and his sons' garments with him.

029:022 Also you shall take some of the ram's fat, the fat tail,

        the fat that covers the innards, the cover of the liver,

        the two kidneys, the fat that is on them, and the right thigh

        (for it is a ram of consecration),

029:023 and one loaf of bread, one cake of oiled bread, and one wafer

        out of the basket of unleavened bread that is before Yahweh.

029:024 You shall put all of this in Aaron's hands, and in his sons'

        hands, and shall wave them for a wave offering before Yahweh.

029:025 You shall take them from their hands, and burn them on the altar

        on the burnt offering, for a sweet savor before Yahweh:

        it is an offering made by fire to Yahweh.

029:026 "You shall take the breast of Aaron's ram of consecration,

        and wave it for a wave offering before Yahweh:

        and it shall be your portion.

029:027 You shall sanctify the breast of the wave offering, and the thigh

        of the wave offering, which is waved, and which is heaved up,

        of the ram of consecration, even of that which is for Aaron,

        and of that which is for his sons:

029:028 and it shall be for Aaron and his sons as their portion forever

        from the children of Israel; for it is a wave offering:

        and it shall be a wave offering from the children of Israel

        of the sacrifices of their peace offerings, even their wave

        offering to Yahweh.

029:029 "The holy garments of Aaron shall be for his sons after him,

        to be anointed in them, and to be consecrated in them.

029:030 Seven days shall the son who is priest in his place put

        them on, when he comes into the tent of meeting to minister

        in the holy place.

029:031 "You shall take the ram of consecration, and boil its flesh

        in a holy place.

029:032 Aaron and his sons shall eat the flesh of the ram, and the bread

        that is in the basket, at the door of the tent of meeting.

029:033 They shall eat those things with which atonement was made,

        to consecrate and sanctify them:  but a stranger shall not eat

        of it, because they are holy.

029:034 If anything of the flesh of the consecration, or of the bread,

        remains to the morning, then you shall burn the remainder with fire:

        it shall not be eaten, because it is holy.

029:035 "Thus shall you do to Aaron, and to his sons, according to all

        that I have commanded you.  Seven days shall you consecrate them.

029:036 Every day shall you offer the bull of sin offering for atonement:

        and you shall cleanse the altar, when you make atonement for it;

        and you shall anoint it, to sanctify it.

029:037 Seven days you shall make atonement for the altar, and sanctify it:

        and the altar shall be most holy; whatever touches the altar

        shall be holy.

029:038 "Now this is that which you shall offer on the altar:

        two lambs a year old day by day continually.

029:039 The one lamb you shall offer in the morning; and the other lamb

        you shall offer at evening:

029:040 and with the one lamb a tenth part of an ephah of fine

        flour mixed with the fourth part of a hin of beaten oil,

        and the fourth part of a hin of wine for a drink offering.

029:041 The other lamb you shall offer at evening, and shall do to it

        according to the meal offering of the morning, and according

        to its drink offering, for a sweet savor, an offering made

        by fire to Yahweh.

029:042 It shall be a continual burnt offering throughout your

        generations at the door of the tent of meeting before Yahweh,

        where I will meet with you, to speak there to you.

029:043 There I will meet with the children of Israel; and the place

        shall be sanctified by my glory.

029:044 I will sanctify the tent of meeting and the altar:

        Aaron also and his sons I will sanctify, to minister to me

        in the priest's office.

029:045 I will dwell among the children of Israel, and will be their God.

029:046 They shall know that I am Yahweh their God, who brought them

        forth out of the land of Egypt, that I might dwell among them:

        I am Yahweh their God.

030:001 "You shall make an altar to burn incense on.  You shall make

        it of acacia wood.

030:002 Its length shall be a cubit, and its breadth a cubit.

        It shall be square, and its height shall be two cubits.

        Its horns shall be of one piece with it.

030:003 You shall overlay it with pure gold, the top of it, the sides

        of it around it, and its horns; and you shall make a gold

        molding around it.

030:004 You shall make two golden rings for it under its molding;

        on its two ribs, on its two sides you shall make them;

        and they shall be for places for poles with which to bear it.

030:005 You shall make the poles of acacia wood, and overlay

        them with gold.

030:006 You shall put it before the veil that is by the ark of the testimony,

        before the mercy seat that is over the testimony, where I

        will meet with you.

030:007 Aaron shall burn incense of sweet spices on it every morning.

        When he tends the lamps, he shall burn it.

030:008 When Aaron lights the lamps at evening, he shall burn it,

        a perpetual incense before Yahweh throughout your generations.

030:009 You shall offer no strange incense on it, nor burnt offering,

        nor meal offering; and you shall pour no drink offering on it.

030:010 Aaron shall make atonement on its horns once in the year;

        with the blood of the sin offering of atonement once in the year

        he shall make atonement for it throughout your generations.

        It is most holy to Yahweh."

030:011 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

030:012 "When you take a census of the children of Israel, according to

        those who are numbered among them, then each man shall give

        a ransom for his soul to Yahweh, when you number them;

        that there be no plague among them when you number them.

030:013 They shall give this, everyone who passes over to those who

        are numbered, half a shekel after the shekel of the sanctuary;

        (the shekel is twenty gerahs;) half a shekel for an

        offering to Yahweh.

030:014 Everyone who passes over to those who are numbered, from twenty

        years old and upward, shall give the offering to Yahweh.

030:015 The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less,

        than the half shekel, when they give the offering of Yahweh,

        to make atonement for your souls.

030:016 You shall take the atonement money from the children of Israel,

        and shall appoint it for the service of the tent of meeting;

        that it may be a memorial for the children of Israel before Yahweh,

        to make atonement for your souls."

030:017 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

030:018 "You shall also make a basin of brass, and the base of it

        of brass, in which to wash.  You shall put it between the tent

        of meeting and the altar, and you shall put water in it.

030:019 Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet in it.

030:020 When they go into the tent of meeting, they shall wash with water,

        that they not die; or when they come near to the altar to minister,

        to burn an offering made by fire to Yahweh.

030:021 So they shall wash their hands and their feet, that they not die:

        and it shall be a statute forever to them, even to him

        and to his descendants throughout their generations."

030:022 Moreover Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

030:023 "Also take fine spices:  of liquid myrrh, five hundred shekels;

        and of fragrant cinnamon half as much, even two hundred and fifty;

        and of fragrant cane, two hundred and fifty;

030:024 and of cassia five hundred, after the shekel of the sanctuary;

        and a hin of olive oil.

030:025 You shall make it a holy anointing oil, a perfume compounded

        after the art of the perfumer:  it shall be a holy anointing oil.

030:026 You shall use it to anoint the tent of meeting, the ark

        of the testimony,

030:027 the table and all its articles, the lampstand and its accessories,

        the altar of incense,

030:028 the altar of burnt offering with all its utensils, and the basin

        with its base.

030:029 You shall sanctify them, that they may be most holy.

        Whatever touches them shall be holy.

030:030 You shall anoint Aaron and his sons, and sanctify them,

        that they may minister to me in the priest's office.

030:031 You shall speak to the children of Israel, saying, 'This shall

        be a holy anointing oil to me throughout your generations.

030:032 It shall not be poured on man's flesh, neither shall you make

        any like it, according to its composition:  it is holy.

        It shall be holy to you.

030:033 Whoever compounds any like it, or whoever puts any of it

        on a stranger, he shall be cut off from his people.'"

030:034 Yahweh said to Moses, "Take to yourself sweet spices, gum resin,

        and onycha, and galbanum; sweet spices with pure frankincense:

        of each shall there be an equal weight;

030:035 and you shall make incense of it, a perfume after the art

        of the perfumer, seasoned with salt, pure and holy:

030:036 and you shall beat some of it very small, and put some of it before

        the testimony in the tent of meeting, where I will meet with you.

        It shall be to you most holy.

030:037 The incense which you shall make, according to its composition

        you shall not make for yourselves:  it shall be to you

        holy for Yahweh.

030:038 Whoever shall make any like that, to smell of it, he shall

        be cut off from his people."

031:001 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

031:002 "Behold, I have called by name Bezalel the son of Uri,

        the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah:

031:003 and I have filled him with the Spirit of God, in wisdom,

        and in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all

        manner of workmanship,

031:004 to devise skillful works, to work in gold, and in silver,

        and in brass,

031:005 and in cutting of stones for setting, and in carving of wood,

        to work in all manner of workmanship.

031:006 I, behold, I have appointed with him Oholiab, the son

        of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan; and in the heart of all

        who are wise-hearted I have put wisdom, that they may make

        all that I have commanded you:

031:007 the tent of meeting, the ark of the testimony, the mercy seat

        that is on it, all the furniture of the Tent,

031:008 the table and its vessels, the pure lampstand with all its vessels,

        the altar of incense,

031:009 the altar of burnt offering with all its vessels, the basin

        and its base,

031:010 the finely worked garments--the holy garments for Aaron the priest--

        the garments of his sons to minister in the priest's office,

031:011 the anointing oil, and the incense of sweet spices for

        the holy place:  according to all that I have commanded you

        they shall do."

031:012 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

031:013 "Speak also to the children of Israel, saying, 'Most certainly

        you shall keep my Sabbaths:  for it is a sign between me

        and you throughout your generations; that you may know that I

        am Yahweh who sanctifies you.

031:014 You shall keep the Sabbath therefore; for it is holy to you.

        Everyone who profanes it shall surely be put to death;

        for whoever does any work therein, that soul shall be cut

        off from among his people.

031:015 Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day is a Sabbath

        of solemn rest, holy to Yahweh.  Whoever does any work on

        the Sabbath day shall surely be put to death.

031:016 Therefore the children of Israel shall keep the Sabbath,

        to observe the Sabbath throughout their generations,

        for a perpetual covenant.

031:017 It is a sign between me and the children of Israel forever;

        for in six days Yahweh made heaven and earth, and on the seventh

        day he rested, and was refreshed.'"

031:018 He gave to Moses, when he finished speaking with him on

        Mount Sinai, the two tablets of the testimony, stone tablets,

        written with God's finger.

032:001 When the people saw that Moses delayed to come down from

        the mountain, the people gathered themselves together to Aaron,

        and said to him, "Come, make us gods, which shall go before us;

        for as for this Moses, the man who brought us up out of the land

        of Egypt, we don't know what has become of him."

032:002 Aaron said to them, "Take off the golden rings, which are in

        the ears of your wives, of your sons, and of your daughters,

        and bring them to me."

032:003 All the people took off the golden rings which were in their ears,

        and brought them to Aaron.

032:004 He received what they handed him, and fashioned it with an

        engraving tool, and made it a molten calf; and they said,

        "These are your gods, Israel, which brought you up out of

        the land of Egypt."

032:005 When Aaron saw this, he built an altar before it; and Aaron made

        a proclamation, and said, "Tomorrow shall be a feast to Yahweh."

032:006 They rose up early on the next day, and offered burnt offerings,

        and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat

        and to drink, and rose up to play.

032:007 Yahweh spoke to Moses, "Go, get down; for your people, who you

        brought up out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves!

032:008 They have turned aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them.

        They have made themselves a molten calf, and have worshiped it,

        and have sacrificed to it, and said, 'These are your gods,

        Israel, which brought you up out of the land of Egypt.'"

032:009 Yahweh said to Moses, "I have seen these people, and behold,

        they are a stiff-necked people.

032:010 Now therefore leave me alone, that my wrath may burn hot

        against them, and that I may consume them; and I will make

        of you a great nation."

032:011 Moses begged Yahweh his God, and said, "Yahweh, why does your

        wrath burn hot against your people, that you have brought

        forth out of the land of Egypt with great power and with

        a mighty hand?

032:012 Why should the Egyptians speak, saying, 'He brought them forth

        for evil, to kill them in the mountains, and to consume them

        from the surface of the earth?'  Turn from your fierce wrath,

        and repent of this evil against your people.

032:013 Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, your servants,

        to whom you swore by your own self, and said to them,

        'I will multiply your seed as the stars of the sky, and all

        this land that I have spoken of I will give to your seed,

        and they shall inherit it forever.'"

032:014 Yahweh repented of the evil which he said he would do

        to his people.

032:015 Moses turned, and went down from the mountain, with the two

        tablets of the testimony in his hand; tablets that were

        written on both their sides; on the one side and on the other

        they were written.

032:016 The tablets were the work of God, and the writing was the writing

        of God, engraved on the tables.

032:017 When Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted,

        he said to Moses, "There is the noise of war in the camp."

032:018 He said, "It isn't the voice of those who shout for victory,

        neither is it the voice of those who cry for being overcome;

        but the noise of those who sing that I hear."

032:019 It happened, as soon as he came near to the camp, that he saw

        the calf and the dancing:  and Moses' anger grew hot,

        and he threw the tablets out of his hands, and broke them

        beneath the mountain.

032:020 He took the calf which they had made, and burnt it with fire,

        ground it to powder, and scattered it on the water, and made

        the children of Israel drink of it.

032:021 Moses said to Aaron, "What did these people do to you,

        that you have brought a great sin on them?"

032:022 Aaron said, "Don't let the anger of my lord grow hot.

        You know the people, that they are set on evil.

032:023 For they said to me, 'Make us gods, which shall go before us;

        for as for this Moses, the man who brought us up out of the land

        of Egypt, we don't know what has become of him.'

032:024 I said to them, 'Whoever has any gold, let them take it off:'

        so they gave it to me; and I threw it into the fire,

        and out came this calf."

032:025 When Moses saw that the people had broken loose, (for Aaron

        had let them loose for a derision among their enemies),

032:026 then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, "Whoever is

        on Yahweh's side, come to me!"  All the sons of Levi gathered

        themselves together to him.

032:027 He said to them, "Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, 'Every man

        put his sword on his thigh, and go back and forth from gate

        to gate throughout the camp, and every man kill his brother,

        and every man his companion, and every man his neighbor.'"

032:028 The sons of Levi did according to the word of Moses:

        and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men.

032:029 Moses said, "Consecrate yourselves today to Yahweh, yes, every man

        against his son, and against his brother; that he may bestow

        on you a blessing this day."

032:030 It happened on the next day, that Moses said to the people,

        "You have sinned a great sin.  Now I will go up to Yahweh.

        Perhaps I shall make atonement for your sin."

032:031 Moses returned to Yahweh, and said, "Oh, this people have sinned

        a great sin, and have made themselves gods of gold.

032:032 Yet now, if you will, forgive their sin--and if not, please blot

        me out of your book which you have written."

032:033 Yahweh said to Moses, "Whoever has sinned against me,

        him will I blot out of my book.

032:034 Now go, lead the people to the place of which I have

        spoken to you.  Behold, my angel shall go before you.

        Nevertheless in the day when I punish, I will punish them

        for their sin."

032:035 Yahweh struck the people, because they made the calf,

        which Aaron made.

033:001 Yahweh spoke to Moses, "Depart, go up from here, you and

        the people that you have brought up out of the land of Egypt,

        to the land of which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac,

        and to Jacob, saying, 'I will give it to your seed.'

033:002 I will send an angel before you; and I will drive out the Canaanite,

        the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite,

        and the Jebusite:

033:003 to a land flowing with milk and honey:  for I will not go

        up in the midst of you, for you are a stiff-necked people,

        lest I consume you in the way."

033:004 When the people heard this evil news, they mourned:

        and no one put on his jewelry.

033:005 Yahweh said to Moses, "Tell the children of Israel, 'You are

        a stiff-necked people.  If I were to go up into your midst

        for one moment, I would consume you.  Therefore now take off

        your jewelry from you, that I may know what to do to you.'"

033:006 The children of Israel stripped themselves of their jewelry

        from Mount Horeb onward.

033:007 Now Moses used to take the tent and to pitch it outside the camp,

        far away from the camp, and he called it "The tent of meeting."

        It happened that everyone who sought Yahweh went out to the tent

        of meeting, which was outside the camp.

033:008 It happened that when Moses went out to the Tent, that all

        the people rose up, and stood, everyone at their tent door,

        and watched Moses, until he had gone into the Tent.

033:009 It happened, when Moses entered into the Tent, that the pillar

        of cloud descended, stood at the door of the Tent,

        and spoke with Moses.

033:010 All the people saw the pillar of cloud stand at the door

        of the Tent, and all the people rose up and worshiped,

        everyone at their tent door.

033:011 Yahweh spoke to Moses face to face, as a man speaks to his friend.

        He turned again into the camp, but his servant Joshua,

        the son of Nun, a young man, didn't depart out of the Tent.

033:012 Moses said to Yahweh, "Behold, you tell me, 'Bring up this people:'

        and you haven't let me know whom you will send with me.

        Yet you have said, 'I know you by name, and you have also found

        favor in my sight.'

033:013 Now therefore, if I have found favor in your sight,

        please show me now your ways, that I may know you, so that I

        may find favor in your sight:  and consider that this nation

        is your people."

033:014 He said, "My presence will go with you, and I will give you rest."

033:015 He said to him, "If your presence doesn't go with me,

        don't carry us up from here.

033:016 For how would people know that I have found favor in your sight,

        I and your people?  Isn't it in that you go with us,

        so that we are separated, I and your people, from all the people

        who are on the surface of the earth?"

033:017 Yahweh said to Moses, "I will do this thing also that you

        have spoken; for you have found favor in my sight, and I know

        you by name."

033:018 He said, "Please show me your glory."

033:019 He said, "I will make all my goodness pass before you,

        and will proclaim the name of Yahweh before you.

        I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show

        mercy on whom I will show mercy."

033:020 He said, "You cannot see my face, for man may not see

        me and live."

033:021 Yahweh also said, "Behold, there is a place by me, and you

        shall stand on the rock.

033:022 It will happen, while my glory passes by, that I will put you

        in a cleft of the rock, and will cover you with my hand until

        I have passed by;

033:023 then I will take away my hand, and you will see my back;

        but my face shall not be seen."

034:001 Yahweh said to Moses, "Chisel two stone tablets like the first:

        and I will write on the tablets the words that were on

        the first tablets, which you broke.

034:002 Be ready by the morning, and come up in the morning to Mount Sinai,

        and present yourself there to me on the top of the mountain.

034:003 No one shall come up with you; neither let anyone be seen

        throughout all the mountain; neither let the flocks nor herds

        feed before that mountain."

034:004 He chiseled two tablets of stone like the first; and Moses rose

        up early in the morning, and went up to Mount Sinai, as Yahweh

        had commanded him, and took in his hand two stone tablets.

034:005 Yahweh descended in the cloud, and stood with him there,

        and proclaimed the name of Yahweh.

034:006 Yahweh passed by before him, and proclaimed, "Yahweh!  Yahweh, a

        merciful and gracious God, slow to anger, and abundant

        in loving kindness and truth,

034:007 keeping loving kindness for thousands, forgiving iniquity

        and disobedience and sin; and that will by no means clear

        the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children,

        and on the children's children, on the third and on

        the fourth generation."

034:008 Moses hurried and bowed his head toward the earth, and worshiped.

034:009 He said, "If now I have found favor in your sight, Lord,

        please let the Lord go in the midst of us; although this

        is a stiff-necked people; pardon our iniquity and our sin,

        and take us for your inheritance."

034:010 He said, "Behold, I make a covenant:  before all your people I

        will do marvels, such as have not been worked in all the earth,

        nor in any nation; and all the people among which you are shall

        see the work of Yahweh; for it is an awesome thing that I

        do with you.

034:011 Observe that which I command you this day.  Behold, I drive

        out before you the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Hittite,

        the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite.

034:012 Be careful, lest you make a covenant with the inhabitants

        of the land where you are going, lest it be for a snare

        in the midst of you:

034:013 but you shall break down their altars, and dash in pieces

        their pillars, and you shall cut down their Asherim;

034:014 for you shall worship no other god:  for Yahweh, whose name

        is Jealous, is a jealous God.

034:015 Don't make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land,

        lest they play the prostitute after their gods, and sacrifice

        to their gods, and one call you and you eat of his sacrifice;

034:016 and you take of their daughters to your sons, and their daughters

        play the prostitute after their gods, and make your sons play

        the prostitute after their gods.

034:017 You shall make no cast idols for yourselves.

034:018 "You shall keep the feast of unleavened bread.

        Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, as I commanded you,

        at the time appointed in the month Abib; for in the month

        Abib you came out from Egypt.

034:019 All that opens the womb is mine; and all your livestock

        that is male, the firstborn of cow and sheep.

034:020 The firstborn of a donkey you shall redeem with a lamb:

        and if you will not redeem it, then you shall break its neck.

        All the firstborn of your sons you shall redeem.

        No one shall appear before me empty.

034:021 "Six days you shall work, but on the seventh day you shall rest:

        in plowing time and in harvest you shall rest.

034:022 You shall observe the feast of weeks with the first fruits

        of wheat harvest, and the feast of harvest at the year's end.

034:023 Three times in the year all your males shall appear before

        the Lord Yahweh, the God of Israel.

034:024 For I will drive out nations before you and enlarge your borders;

        neither shall any man desire your land when you go up to appear

        before Yahweh, your God, three times in the year.

034:025 "You shall not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leavened bread;

        neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the Passover

        be left to the morning.

034:026 You shall bring the first of the first fruits of your ground

        to the house of Yahweh your God.  You shall not boil a young

        goat in its mother's milk."

034:027 Yahweh said to Moses, "Write you these words:

        for in accordance with these words I have made a covenant

        with you and with Israel."

034:028 He was there with Yahweh forty days and forty nights;

        he neither ate bread, nor drank water.  He wrote on the tablets

        the words of the covenant, the ten commandments.

034:029 It happened, when Moses came down from Mount Sinai with the two

        tablets of the testimony in Moses' hand, when he came down

        from the mountain, that Moses didn't know that the skin

        of his face shone by reason of his speaking with him.

034:030 When Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin

        of his face shone; and they were afraid to come near him.

034:031 Moses called to them, and Aaron and all the rulers of the

        congregation returned to him; and Moses spoke to them.

034:032 Afterward all the children of Israel came near, and he gave

        them all of the commandments that Yahweh had spoken with him

        on Mount Sinai.

034:033 When Moses was done speaking with them, he put a veil on his face.

034:034 But when Moses went in before Yahweh to speak with him,

        he took the veil off, until he came out; and he came out,

        and spoke to the children of Israel that which he was commanded.

034:035 The children of Israel saw Moses' face, that the skin of Moses'

        face shone:  and Moses put the veil on his face again,

        until he went in to speak with him.

035:001 Moses assembled all the congregation of the children of Israel,

        and said to them, "These are the words which Yahweh has commanded,

        that you should do them.

035:002 'Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day there shall

        be a holy day for you, a Sabbath of solemn rest to Yahweh:

        whoever does any work in it shall be put to death.

035:003 You shall kindle no fire throughout your habitations on

        the Sabbath day.'"

035:004 Moses spoke to all the congregation of the children of Israel,

        saying, "This is the thing which Yahweh commanded, saying,

035:005 'Take from among you an offering to Yahweh.  Whoever is

        of a willing heart, let him bring it, Yahweh's offering:

        gold, silver, brass,

035:006 blue, purple, scarlet, fine linen, goats' hair,

035:007 rams' skins dyed red, sea cow hides, acacia wood,

035:008 oil for the light, spices for the anointing oil and for

        the sweet incense,

035:009 onyx stones, and stones to be set for the ephod and

        for the breastplate.

035:010 "'Let every wise-hearted man among you come, and make all

        that Yahweh has commanded:

035:011 the tent, its outer covering, its roof, its clasps, its boards,

        its bars, its pillars, and its sockets;

035:012 the ark, and its poles, the mercy seat, the veil of the screen;

035:013 the table with its poles and all its vessels, and the show bread;

035:014 the lampstand also for the light, with its vessels, its lamps,

        and the oil for the light;

035:015 and the altar of incense with its poles, the anointing oil,

        the sweet incense, the screen for the door, at the door

        of the tent;

035:016 the altar of burnt offering, with its grating of brass,

        it poles, and all its vessels, the basin and its base;

035:017 the hangings of the court, its pillars, their sockets,

        and the screen for the gate of the court;

035:018 the pins of the tent, the pins of the court, and their cords;

035:019 the finely worked garments, for ministering in the holy place,

        the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments

        of his sons, to minister in the priest's office.'"

035:020 All the congregation of the children of Israel departed from

        the presence of Moses.

035:021 They came, everyone whose heart stirred him up, and everyone

        whom his spirit made willing, and brought Yahweh's offering,

        for the work of the tent of meeting, and for all of its service,

        and for the holy garments.

035:022 They came, both men and women, as many as were willing-hearted,

        and brought brooches, earrings, signet rings, and armlets,

        all jewels of gold; even every man who offered an offering

        of gold to Yahweh.

035:023 Everyone, with whom was found blue, purple, scarlet,

        fine linen, goats' hair, rams' skins dyed red, and sea

        cow hides, brought them.

035:024 Everyone who did offer an offering of silver and brass brought

        Yahweh's offering; and everyone, with whom was found acacia

        wood for any work of the service, brought it.

035:025 All the women who were wise-hearted spun with their hands,

        and brought that which they had spun, the blue, the purple,

        the scarlet, and the fine linen.

035:026 All the women whose heart stirred them up in wisdom spun

        the goats' hair.

035:027 The rulers brought the onyx stones, and the stones to be set,

        for the ephod and for the breastplate;

035:028 and the spice, and the oil for the light, for the anointing oil,

        and for the sweet incense.

035:029 The children of Israel brought a freewill offering to Yahweh;

        every man and woman, whose heart made them willing to bring

        for all the work, which Yahweh had commanded to be made by Moses.

035:030 Moses said to the children of Israel, "Behold, Yahweh has

        called by name Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur,

        of the tribe of Judah.

035:031 He has filled him with the Spirit of God, in wisdom,

        in understanding, in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship;

035:032 and to make skillful works, to work in gold, in silver, in brass,

035:033 in cutting of stones for setting, and in carving of wood,

        to work in all kinds of skillful workmanship.

035:034 He has put in his heart that he may teach, both he, and Oholiab,

        the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan.

035:035 He has filled them with wisdom of heart, to work all manner

        of workmanship, of the engraver, of the skillful workman,

        and of the embroiderer, in blue, in purple, in scarlet,

        and in fine linen, and of the weaver, even of those who do

        any workmanship, and of those who make skillful works.

036:001 "Bezalel and Oholiab shall work with every wise-hearted man,

        in whom Yahweh has put wisdom and understanding to know

        how to work all the work for the service of the sanctuary,

        according to all that Yahweh has commanded."

036:002 Moses called Bezalel and Oholiab, and every wise-hearted man,

        in whose heart Yahweh had put wisdom, even everyone whose

        heart stirred him up to come to the work to do it:

036:003 and they received from Moses all the offering which the children

        of Israel had brought for the work of the service of the sanctuary,

        with which to make it.  They brought yet to him freewill

        offerings every morning.

036:004 All the wise men, who performed all the work of the sanctuary,

        each came from his work which they did.

036:005 They spoke to Moses, saying, "The people bring much more than enough

        for the service of the work which Yahweh commanded to make."

036:006 Moses gave commandment, and they caused it to be proclaimed

        throughout the camp, saying, "Let neither man nor woman

        make anything else for the offering for the sanctuary."

        So the people were restrained from bringing.

036:007 For the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make it,

        and too much.

036:008 All the wise-hearted men among those who did the work made

        the tent with ten curtains; of fine twined linen, blue, purple,

        and scarlet, with cherubim, the work of the skillful workman,

        they made them.

036:009 The length of each curtain was twenty-eight cubits,

        and the breadth of each curtain four cubits.  All the curtains

        had one measure.

036:010 He coupled five curtains to one another, and the other five

        curtains he coupled one to another.

036:011 He made loops of blue on the edge of the one curtain from

        the edge in the coupling.  Likewise he made in the edge

        of the curtain that was outmost in the second coupling.

036:012 He made fifty loops in the one curtain, and he made fifty loops

        in the edge of the curtain that was in the second coupling.

        The loops were opposite one to another.

036:013 He made fifty clasps of gold, and coupled the curtains one

        to another with the clasps:  so the tent was a unit.

036:014 He made curtains of goats' hair for a covering over the tent.

        He made them eleven curtains.

036:015 The length of each curtain was thirty cubits, and four

        cubits the breadth of each curtain.  The eleven curtains

        had one measure.

036:016 He coupled five curtains by themselves, and six curtains

        by themselves.

036:017 He made fifty loops on the edge of the curtain that was

        outmost in the coupling, and he made fifty loops on the edge

        of the curtain which was outmost in the second coupling.

036:018 He made fifty clasps of brass to couple the tent together,

        that it might be a unit.

036:019 He made a covering for the tent of rams' skins dyed red,

        and a covering of sea cow hides above.

036:020 He made the boards for the tent of acacia wood, standing up.

036:021 Ten cubits was the length of a board, and a cubit and a half

        the breadth of each board.

036:022 Each board had two tenons, joined one to another.

        He made all the boards of the tent this way.

036:023 He made the boards for the tent:  twenty boards for the

        south side southward.

036:024 He made forty sockets of silver under the twenty boards;

        two sockets under one board for its two tenons, and two sockets

        under another board for its two tenons.

036:025 For the second side of the tent, on the north side,

        he made twenty boards,

036:026 and their forty sockets of silver; two sockets under one board,

        and two sockets under another board.

036:027 For the far part of the tent westward he made six boards.

036:028 He made two boards for the corners of the tent in the far part.

036:029 They were double beneath, and in like manner they were all

        the way to the top of it to one ring.  He did thus to both

        of them in the two corners.

036:030 There were eight boards, and their sockets of silver,

        sixteen sockets; under every board two sockets.

036:031 He made bars of acacia wood; five for the boards of the one

        side of the tent,

036:032 and five bars for the boards of the other side of the tent, and five

        bars for the boards of the tent for the hinder part westward.

036:033 He made the middle bar to pass through in the midst of the boards

        from the one end to the other.

036:034 He overlaid the boards with gold, and made their rings of gold

        for places for the bars, and overlaid the bars with gold.

036:035 He made the veil of blue, purple, scarlet, and fine twined linen:

        with cherubim.  He made it the work of a skillful workman.

036:036 He made four pillars of acacia for it, and overlaid them with gold.

        Their hooks were of gold.  He cast four sockets of silver for them.

036:037 He made a screen for the door of the tent, of blue, purple, scarlet,

        and fine twined linen, the work of an embroiderer;

036:038 and the five pillars of it with their hooks.  He overlaid

        their capitals and their fillets with gold, and their five

        sockets were of brass.

037:001 Bezalel made the ark of acacia wood.  Its length was two

        and a half cubits, and its breadth a cubit and a half,

        and a cubit and a half its height.

037:002 He overlaid it with pure gold inside and outside, and made

        a molding of gold for it round about.

037:003 He cast four rings of gold for it, in its four feet; even two

        rings on its one side, and two rings on its other side.

037:004 He made poles of acacia wood, and overlaid them with gold.

037:005 He put the poles into the rings on the sides of the ark,

        to bear the ark.

037:006 He made a mercy seat of pure gold.  Its length was two and a

        half cubits, and a cubit and a half its breadth.

037:007 He made two cherubim of gold.  He made them of beaten work,

        at the two ends of the mercy seat;

037:008 one cherub at the one end, and one cherub at the other end.

        He made the cherubim of one piece with the mercy seat at

        its two ends.

037:009 The cherubim spread out their wings on high, covering the mercy

        seat with their wings, with their faces toward one another.

        The faces of the cherubim were toward the mercy seat.

037:010 He made the table of acacia wood.  Its length was two cubits,

        and its breadth was a cubit, and its height was a cubit

        and a half.

037:011 He overlaid it with pure gold, and made a gold molding around it.

037:012 He made a border of a handbreadth around it, and made a golden

        molding on its border around it.

037:013 He cast four rings of gold for it, and put the rings in the four

        corners that were on its four feet.

037:014 The rings were close by the border, the places for the poles

        to carry the table.

037:015 He made the poles of acacia wood, and overlaid them with gold,

        to carry the table.

037:016 He made the vessels which were on the table, its dishes,

        its spoons, its bowls, and its pitchers with which to pour out,

        of pure gold.

037:017 He made the lampstand of pure gold.  He made the lampstand

        of beaten work.  Its base, its shaft, its cups, its buds,

        and its flowers were of one piece with it.

037:018 There were six branches going out of its sides:

        three branches of the lampstand out of its one side,

        and three branches of the lampstand out of its other side:

037:019 three cups made like almond blossoms in one branch,

        a bud and a flower, and three cups made like almond

        blossoms in the other branch, a bud and a flower:

        so for the six branches going out of the lampstand.

037:020 In the lampstand were four cups made like almond blossoms,

        its buds and its flowers;

037:021 and a bud under two branches of one piece with it, and a bud

        under two branches of one piece with it, and a bud under two

        branches of one piece with it, for the six branches going

        out of it.

037:022 Their buds and their branches were of one piece with it.

        The whole thing was one beaten work of pure gold.

037:023 He made its seven lamps, and its snuffers, and its snuff dishes,

        of pure gold.

037:024 He made it of a talent of pure gold, with all its vessels.

037:025 He made the altar of incense of acacia wood.  It was square:

        its length was a cubit, and its breadth a cubit.

        Its height was two cubits.  Its horns were of one piece with it.

037:026 He overlaid it with pure gold, its top, its sides around it,

        and its horns.  He made a gold molding around it.

037:027 He made two golden rings for it under its molding crown,

        on its two ribs, on its two sides, for places for poles

        with which to carry it.

037:028 He made the poles of acacia wood, and overlaid them with gold.

037:029 He made the holy anointing oil and the pure incense of sweet spices,

        after the art of the perfumer.

038:001 He made the altar of burnt offering of acacia wood.  It was square.

        Its length was five cubits, its breadth was five cubits,

        and its height was three cubits.

038:002 He made its horns on its four corners.  Its horns were of one

        piece with it, and he overlaid it with brass.

038:003 He made all the vessels of the altar, the pots, the shovels,

        the basins, the forks, and the fire pans.  He made all its

        vessels of brass.

038:004 He made for the altar a grating of a network of brass,

        under the ledge around it beneath, reaching halfway up.

038:005 He cast four rings for the four ends of brass grating,

        to be places for the poles.

038:006 He made the poles of acacia wood, and overlaid them with brass.

038:007 He put the poles into the rings on the sides of the altar,

        with which to carry it.  He made it hollow with planks.

038:008 He made the basin of brass, and its base of brass, out of

        the mirrors of the ministering women who ministered at the door

        of the tent of meeting.

038:009 He made the court:  for the south side southward the hangings

        of the court were of fine twined linen, one hundred cubits;

038:010 their pillars were twenty, and their sockets twenty, of brass;

        the hooks of the pillars and their fillets were of silver.

038:011 For the north side one hundred cubits, their pillars twenty,

        and their sockets twenty, of brass; the hooks of the pillars,

        and their fillets, of silver.

038:012 For the west side were hangings of fifty cubits, their pillars ten,

        and their sockets ten; the hooks of the pillars,

        and their fillets, of silver.

038:013 For the east side eastward fifty cubits.

038:014 The hangings for the one side were fifteen cubits;

        their pillars three, and their sockets three;

038:015 and so for the other side:  on this hand and that hand

        by the gate of the court were hangings of fifteen cubits;

        their pillars three, and their sockets three.

038:016 All the hangings around the court were of fine twined linen.

038:017 The sockets for the pillars were of brass.  The hooks of the

        pillars and their fillets were of silver; and the overlaying

        of their capitals, of silver; and all the pillars of the court

        were filleted with silver.

038:018 The screen for the gate of the court was the work of the embroiderer,

        of blue, purple, scarlet, and fine twined linen.

        Twenty cubits was the length, and the height in the breadth

        was five cubits, like to the hangings of the court.

038:019 Their pillars were four, and their sockets four, of brass;

        their hooks of silver, and the overlaying of their capitals,

        and their fillets, of silver.

038:020 All the pins of the tent, and around the court, were of brass.

038:021 This is the amount of material used for the tent, even the Tent

        of the Testimony, as they were counted, according to

        the commandment of Moses, for the service of the Levites,

        by the hand of Ithamar, the son of Aaron the priest.

038:022 Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah,

        made all that Yahweh commanded Moses.

038:023 With him was Oholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan,

        an engraver, and a skillful workman, and an embroiderer in blue,

        in purple, in scarlet, and in fine linen.

038:024 All the gold that was used for the work in all the work

        of the sanctuary, even the gold of the offering,

        was twenty-nine talents, and seven hundred thirty shekels,

        after the shekel of the sanctuary.

038:025 The silver of those who were numbered of the congregation

        was one hundred talents, and one thousand seven hundred

        seventy-five shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary:

038:026 a beka a head, that is, half a shekel, after the shekel

        of the sanctuary, for everyone who passed over to those who

        were numbered, from twenty years old and upward, for six

        hundred three thousand five hundred fifty men.

038:027 The one hundred talents of silver were for casting the sockets

        of the sanctuary, and the sockets of the veil; one hundred

        sockets for the one hundred talents, a talent for a socket.

038:028 Of the one thousand seven hundred seventy-five shekels

        he made hooks for the pillars, overlaid their capitals,

        and made fillets for them.

038:029 The brass of the offering was seventy talents, and two thousand

        four hundred shekels.

038:030 With this he made the sockets to the door of the tent of meeting,

        the bronze altar, the bronze grating for it, all the vessels

        of the altar,

038:031 the sockets around the court, the sockets of the gate of the court,

        all the pins of the tent, and all the pins around the court.

039:001 Of the blue, purple, and scarlet, they made finely worked garments,

        for ministering in the holy place, and made the holy garments

        for Aaron; as Yahweh commanded Moses.

039:002 He made the ephod of gold, blue, purple, scarlet, and fine

        twined linen.

039:003 They beat the gold into thin plates, and cut it into wires,

        to work it in the blue, in the purple, in the scarlet,

        and in the fine linen, the work of the skillful workman.

039:004 They made shoulder straps for it, joined together.

        At the two ends it was joined together.

039:005 The skillfully woven band that was on it, with which to

        fasten it on, was of the same piece, like its work;

        of gold, of blue, purple, scarlet, and fine twined linen;

        as Yahweh commanded Moses.

039:006 They worked the onyx stones, enclosed in settings of gold,

        engraved with the engravings of a signet, according to the names

        of the children of Israel.

039:007 He put them on the shoulder straps of the ephod, to be stones

        of memorial for the children of Israel, as Yahweh commanded Moses.

039:008 He made the breastplate, the work of a skillful workman,

        like the work of the ephod; of gold, of blue, purple, scarlet,

        and fine twined linen.

039:009 It was square.  They made the breastplate double.

        Its length was a span, and its breadth a span, being double.

039:010 They set in it four rows of stones.  A row of ruby, topaz,

        and beryl was the first row;

039:011 and the second row, a turquoise, a sapphire{or, lapis lazuli},

        and an emerald;

039:012 and the third row, a jacinth, an agate, and an amethyst;

039:013 and the fourth row, a chrysolite, an onyx, and a jasper.

        They were enclosed in gold settings.

039:014 The stones were according to the names of the children of Israel,

        twelve, according to their names; like the engravings of a signet,

        everyone according to his name, for the twelve tribes.

039:015 They made on the breastplate chains like cords, of braided

        work of pure gold.

039:016 They made two settings of gold, and two gold rings, and put

        the two rings on the two ends of the breastplate.

039:017 They put the two braided chains of gold in the two rings

        at the ends of the breastplate.

039:018 The other two ends of the two braided chains they put on the

        two settings, and put them on the shoulder straps of the ephod,

        in the front of it.

039:019 They made two rings of gold, and put them on the two ends

        of the breastplate, on the edge of it, which was toward

        the side of the ephod inward.

039:020 They made two rings of gold, and put them on the two shoulder

        straps of the ephod underneath, in the front of it, close by

        its coupling, above the skillfully woven band of the ephod.

039:021 They bound the breastplate by its rings to the rings of the ephod

        with a lace of blue, that it might be on the skillfully woven

        band of the ephod, and that the breastplate might not come

        loose from the ephod, as Yahweh commanded Moses.

039:022 He made the robe of the ephod of woven work, all of blue.

039:023 The opening of the robe in the midst of it was like the opening

        of a coat of mail, with a binding around its opening,

        that it should not be torn.

039:024 They made on the skirts of the robe pomegranates of blue,

        purple, scarlet, and twined linen.

039:025 They made bells of pure gold, and put the bells between

        the pomegranates around the skirts of the robe,

        between the pomegranates;

039:026 a bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate, around the

        skirts of the robe, to minister in, as Yahweh commanded Moses.

039:027 They made the coats of fine linen of woven work for Aaron,

        and for his sons,

039:028 and the turban of fine linen, and the linen headbands of fine linen,

        and the linen breeches of fine twined linen,

039:029 and the sash of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet,

        the work of the embroiderer, as Yahweh commanded Moses.

039:030 They made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold,

        and wrote on it a writing, like the engravings of a signet:

        "HOLY TO YAHWEH."

039:031 They tied to it a lace of blue, to fasten it on the turban above,

        as Yahweh commanded Moses.

039:032 Thus all the work of the tent of the tent of meeting was finished.

        The children of Israel did according to all that Yahweh

        commanded Moses; so they did.

039:033 They brought the tent to Moses, the tent, with all its furniture,

        its clasps, its boards, its bars, its pillars, its sockets,

039:034 the covering of rams' skins dyed red, the covering of sea

        cow hides, the veil of the screen,

039:035 the ark of the testimony with its poles, the mercy seat,

039:036 the table, all its vessels, the show bread,

039:037 the pure lampstand, its lamps, even the lamps to be set in order,

        all its vessels, the oil for the light,

039:038 the golden altar, the anointing oil, the sweet incense,

        the screen for the door of the Tent,

039:039 the bronze altar, its grating of brass, its poles, all of

        its vessels, the basin and its base,

039:040 the hangings of the court, its pillars, its sockets,

        the screen for the gate of the court, its cords, its pins,

        all the instruments of the service of the tent, for the

        tent of meeting,

039:041 the finely worked garments for ministering in the holy place,

        the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments

        of his sons, to minister in the priest's office.

039:042 According to all that Yahweh commanded Moses, so the children

        of Israel did all the work.

039:043 Moses saw all the work, and behold, they had done it

        as Yahweh had commanded, even so had they done it:

        and Moses blessed them.

040:001 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

040:002 "On the first day of the first month you shall raise up the tent

        of the Tent of Meeting.

040:003 You shall put the ark of the testimony in it, and you shall

        screen the ark with the veil.

040:004 You shall bring in the table, and set in order the things

        that are on it.  You shall bring in the lampstand, and light

        the lamps of it.

040:005 You shall set the golden altar for incense before the ark

        of the testimony, and put the screen of the door to the tent.

040:006 You shall set the altar of burnt offering before the door

        of the tent of the tent of meeting.

040:007 You shall set the basin between the tent of meeting and the altar,

        and shall put water therein.

040:008 You shall set up the court around it, and hang up the screen

        of the gate of the court.

040:009 You shall take the anointing oil, and anoint the tent, and all

        that is in it, and shall make it holy, and all its furniture:

        and it will be holy.

040:010 You shall anoint the altar of burnt offering, with all its vessels,

        and sanctify the altar:  and the altar will be most holy.

040:011 You shall anoint the basin and its base, and sanctify it.

040:012 You shall bring Aaron and his sons to the door of the tent

        of meeting, and shall wash them with water.

040:013 You shall put on Aaron the holy garments; and you shall

        anoint him, and sanctify him, that he may minister to me

        in the priest's office.

040:014 You shall bring his sons, and put coats on them.

040:015 You shall anoint them, as you anointed their father,

        that they may minister to me in the priest's office.

        Their anointing shall be to them for an everlasting priesthood

        throughout their generations."

040:016 Moses did so.  According to all that Yahweh commanded him,

        so he did.

040:017 It happened in the first month in the second year, on the first

        day of the month, that the tent was raised up.

040:018 Moses raised up the tent, and laid its sockets, and set up

        the boards of it, and put in the bars of it, and raised

        up its pillars.

040:019 He spread the covering over the tent, and put the roof

        of the tent above on it, as Yahweh commanded Moses.

040:020 He took and put the testimony into the ark, and set the poles

        on the ark, and put the mercy seat above on the ark.

040:021 He brought the ark into the tent, and set up the veil

        of the screen, and screened the ark of the testimony,

        as Yahweh commanded Moses.

040:022 He put the table in the tent of meeting, on the side of

        the tent northward, outside of the veil.

040:023 He set the bread in order on it before Yahweh,

        as Yahweh commanded Moses.

040:024 He put the lampstand in the tent of meeting, opposite the table,

        on the side of the tent southward.

040:025 He lit the lamps before Yahweh, as Yahweh commanded Moses.

040:026 He put the golden altar in the tent of meeting before the veil;

040:027 and he burnt incense of sweet spices on it, as Yahweh

        commanded Moses.

040:028 He put up the screen of the door to the tent.

040:029 He set the altar of burnt offering at the door of the tent

        of the tent of meeting, and offered on it the burnt offering

        and the meal offering, as Yahweh commanded Moses.

040:030 He set the basin between the tent of meeting and the altar,

        and put water therein, with which to wash.

040:031 Moses, Aaron, and his sons washed their hands and their feet there.

040:032 When they went into the tent of meeting, and when they came

        near to the altar, they washed, as Yahweh commanded Moses.

040:033 He raised up the court around the tent and the altar,

        and set up the screen of the gate of the court.

        So Moses finished the work.

040:034 Then the cloud covered the tent of meeting, and the glory

        of Yahweh filled the tent.

040:035 Moses wasn't able to enter into the tent of meeting, because the

        cloud stayed on it, and Yahweh's glory filled the tent.

040:036 When the cloud was taken up from over the tent, the children

        of Israel went onward, throughout all their journeys;

040:037 but if the cloud wasn't taken up, then they didn't travel

        until the day that it was taken up.

040:038 For the cloud of Yahweh was on the tent by day, and there was fire

        in the cloud by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel,

        throughout all their journeys.

Book 03 Leviticus

001:001 Yahweh called to Moses, and spoke to him out of the Tent

        of Meeting, saying,

001:002 "Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them, 'When anyone

        of you offers an offering to Yahweh, you shall offer your

        offering of the livestock, from the herd and from the flock.

001:003 "'If his offering is a burnt offering from the herd, he shall

        offer a male without blemish.  He shall offer it at the door

        of the Tent of Meeting, that he may be accepted before Yahweh.

001:004 He shall lay his hand on the head of the burnt offering,

        and it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him.

001:005 He shall kill the bull before Yahweh.  Aaron's sons, the priests,

        shall present the blood and sprinkle the blood around on

        the altar that is at the door of the Tent of Meeting.

001:006 He shall flay the burnt offering, and cut it into pieces.

001:007 The sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire on the altar,

        and lay wood in order on the fire;

001:008 and Aaron's sons, the priests, shall lay the pieces, the head,

        and the fat in order on the wood that is on the fire which is

        on the altar;

001:009 but its innards and its legs he shall wash with water.

        The priest shall burn the whole on the altar, for a burnt offering,

        an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor to Yahweh.

001:010 "'If his offering is from the flock, from the sheep,

        or from the goats, for a burnt offering, he shall offer

        a male without blemish.

001:011 He shall kill it on the north side of the altar before Yahweh.

        Aaron's sons, the priests, shall sprinkle its blood around

        on the altar.

001:012 He shall cut it into its pieces, with its head and its fat.

        The priest shall lay them in order on the wood that is on

        the fire which is on the altar,

001:013 but the innards and the legs he shall wash with water.

        The priest shall offer the whole, and burn it on the altar.

        It is a burnt offering, an offering made by fire, of a sweet

        savor to Yahweh.

001:014 "'If his offering to Yahweh is a burnt offering of birds,

        then he shall offer his offering of turtledoves,

        or of young pigeons.

001:015 The priest shall bring it to the altar, and wring off its head,

        and burn it on the altar; and its blood shall be drained

        out on the side of the altar;

001:016 and he shall take away its crop with its filth, and cast it

        beside the altar on the east part, in the place of the ashes.

001:017 He shall tear it by its wings, but shall not divide it apart.

        The priest shall burn it on the altar, on the wood that is on

        the fire.  It is a burnt offering, an offering made by fire,

        of a sweet savor to Yahweh.

002:001 "'When anyone offers an offering of a meal offering to Yahweh,

        his offering shall be of fine flour; and he shall pour oil on it,

        and put frankincense on it.

002:002 He shall bring it to Aaron's sons the priests; and he shall

        take his handful of its fine flour, and of its oil,

        with all its frankincense; and the priest shall burn

        the memorial of it on the altar, an offering made by fire,

        of a sweet savor to Yahweh.

002:003 That which is left of the meal offering shall be Aaron's

        and his sons'.  It is a most holy thing of the offerings

        of Yahweh made by fire.

002:004 "'When you offer an offering of a meal offering baked in the oven,

        it shall be unleavened cakes of fine flour mixed with oil,

        or unleavened wafers anointed with oil.

002:005 If your offering is a meal offering of the baking pan,

        it shall be of unleavened fine flour, mixed with oil.

002:006 You shall cut it in pieces, and pour oil on it.

        It is a meal offering.

002:007 If your offering is a meal offering of the frying pan,

        it shall be made of fine flour with oil.

002:008 You shall bring the meal offering that is made of these things

        to Yahweh:  and it shall be presented to the priest,

        and he shall bring it to the altar.

002:009 The priest shall take from the meal offering its memorial,

        and shall burn it on the altar, an offering made by fire,

        of a sweet savor to Yahweh.

002:010 That which is left of the meal offering shall be Aaron's

        and his sons'.  It is a thing most holy of the offerings

        of Yahweh made by fire.

002:011 "'No meal offering, which you shall offer to Yahweh, shall be

        made with yeast; for you shall burn no yeast, nor any honey,

        as an offering made by fire to Yahweh.

002:012 As an offering of firstfruits you shall offer them to Yahweh:

        but they shall not come up for a sweet savor on the altar.

002:013 Every offering of your meal offering you shall season with salt;

        neither shall you allow the salt of the covenant of your God

        to be lacking from your meal offering.  With all your offerings

        you shall offer salt.

002:014 "'If you offer a meal offering of first fruits to Yahweh,

        you shall offer for the meal offering of your first fruits grain

        in the ear parched with fire, bruised grain of the fresh ear.

002:015 You shall put oil on it, and lay frankincense on it:

        it is a meal offering.

002:016 The priest shall burn as its memorial, part of its bruised grain,

        and part of its oil, along with all its frankincense:

        it is an offering made by fire to Yahweh.

003:001 "'If his offering is a sacrifice of peace offerings;

        if he offers it from the herd, whether male or female,

        he shall offer it without blemish before Yahweh.

003:002 He shall lay his hand on the head of his offering, and kill

        it at the door of the tent of meeting:  and Aaron's sons

        the priests shall sprinkle the blood on the altar round about.

003:003 He shall offer of the sacrifice of peace offerings an offering

        made by fire to Yahweh; the fat that covers the innards,

        and all the fat that is on the innards,

003:004 and the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is

        by the loins, and the cover on the liver, with the kidneys,

        he shall take away.

003:005 Aaron's sons shall burn it on the altar on the burnt offering,

        which is on the wood that is on the fire:  it is an offering

        made by fire, of a sweet savor to Yahweh.

003:006 "'If his offering for a sacrifice of peace offerings to

        Yahweh is from the flock; male or female, he shall offer

        it without blemish.

003:007 If he offers a lamb for his offering, then he shall offer

        it before Yahweh;

003:008 and he shall lay his hand on the head of his offering,

        and kill it before the tent of meeting:  and Aaron's sons

        shall sprinkle its blood on the altar round about.

003:009 He shall offer from the sacrifice of peace offerings an offering

        made by fire to Yahweh; its fat, the entire tail fat, he shall

        take away close to the backbone; and the fat that covers

        the inwards, and all the fat that is on the inwards,

003:010 and the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is

        by the loins, and the cover on the liver, with the kidneys,

        he shall take away.

003:011 The priest shall burn it on the altar:  it is the food

        of the offering made by fire to Yahweh.

003:012 "'If his offering is a goat, then he shall offer it before Yahweh:

003:013 and he shall lay his hand on its head, and kill it before

        the tent of meeting; and the sons of Aaron shall sprinkle

        its blood on the altar round about.

003:014 He shall offer from it as his offering, an offering made by fire

        to Yahweh; the fat that covers the innards, and all the fat

        that is on the innards,

003:015 and the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is

        by the loins, and the cover on the liver, with the kidneys,

        he shall take away.

003:016 The priest shall burn them on the altar:  it is the food

        of the offering made by fire, for a sweet savor;

        all the fat is Yahweh's.

003:017 "'It shall be a perpetual statute throughout your generations

        in all your dwellings, that you shall eat neither fat nor blood.'"

004:001 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

004:002 "Speak to the children of Israel, saying, 'If anyone

        sins unintentionally, in any of the things which Yahweh has

        commanded not to be done, and does any one of them:

004:003 if the anointed priest sins so as to bring guilt on the people,

        then let him offer for his sin, which he has sinned, a young

        bull without blemish to Yahweh for a sin offering.

004:004 He shall bring the bull to the door of the Tent of Meeting

        before Yahweh; and he shall lay his hand on the head of the bull,

        and kill the bull before Yahweh.

004:005 The anointed priest shall take some of the blood of the bull,

        and bring it to the Tent of Meeting.

004:006 The priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle

        some of the blood seven times before Yahweh, before the veil

        of the sanctuary.

004:007 The priest shall put some of the blood on the horns of the altar

        of sweet incense before Yahweh, which is in the tent of meeting;

        and he shall pour out all of rest of the blood of the bull at

        the base of the altar of burnt offering, which is at the door

        of the Tent of Meeting.

004:008 He shall take all the fat of the bull of the sin offering

        off of it; the fat that covers the innards, and all the fat

        that is on the innards,

004:009 and the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is

        by the loins, and the cover on the liver, with the kidneys,

        he shall take away,

004:010 as it is taken off of the ox of the sacrifice of peace offerings.

        The priest shall burn them on the altar of burnt offering.

004:011 The bull's skin, all its flesh, with its head, and with its legs,

        its innards, and its dung,

004:012 even the whole bull shall he carry forth outside the camp

        to a clean place, where the ashes are poured out, and burn

        it on wood with fire.  Where the ashes are poured out it

        shall be burned.

004:013 "'If the whole congregation of Israel sins, and the thing

        is hidden from the eyes of the assembly, and they have done

        any of the things which Yahweh has commanded not to be done,

        and are guilty;

004:014 when the sin in which they have sinned is known, then the assembly

        shall offer a young bull for a sin offering, and bring it

        before the Tent of Meeting.

004:015 The elders of the congregation shall lay their hands on

        the head of the bull before Yahweh; and the bull shall be

        killed before Yahweh.

004:016 The anointed priest shall bring of the blood of the bull

        to the Tent of Meeting:

004:017 and the priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle

        it seven times before Yahweh, before the veil.

004:018 He shall put some of the blood on the horns of the altar

        which is before Yahweh, that is in the Tent of Meeting;

        and the rest of the blood he shall pour out at the base

        of the altar of burnt offering, which is at the door of

        the Tent of Meeting.

004:019 All its fat he shall take from it, and burn it on the altar.

004:020 Thus shall he do with the bull; as he did with the bull

        of the sin offering, so shall he do with this; and the priest

        shall make atonement for them, and they shall be forgiven.

004:021 He shall carry forth the bull outside the camp, and burn

        it as he burned the first bull.  It is the sin offering

        for the assembly.

004:022 "'When a ruler sins, and unwittingly does any one of all

        the things which Yahweh his God has commanded not to be done,

        and is guilty;

004:023 if his sin, in which he has sinned, is made known to him,

        he shall bring as his offering a goat, a male without blemish.

004:024 He shall lay his hand on the head of the goat, and kill it

        in the place where they kill the burnt offering before Yahweh.

        It is a sin offering.

004:025 The priest shall take some of the blood of the sin offering with

        his finger, and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering.

        He shall pour out the rest of its blood at the base of the altar

        of burnt offering.

004:026 All its fat he shall burn on the altar, like the fat of

        the sacrifice of peace offerings; and the priest shall make

        atonement for him concerning his sin, and he will be forgiven.

004:027 "'If anyone of the common people sins unwittingly, in doing

        any of the things which Yahweh has commanded not to be done,

        then he shall bring for his offering a goat, a female

        without blemish, for his sin which he has sinned.

004:029 He shall lay his hand on the head of the sin offering,

        and kill the sin offering in the place of burnt offering.

004:030 The priest shall take some of its blood with his finger,

        and the rest of its blood he shall pour out at the base

        of the altar.

004:031 All its fat he shall take away, like the fat is taken

        away from off of the sacrifice of peace offerings;

        the burnt offering.

004:034 The priest shall take some of the blood of the sin offering with

        his finger, and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering;

        away from the sacrifice of peace offerings; and the priest shall

        burn them on the altar, on the offerings of Yahweh made by fire;

        the one which is for the sin offering, and wring off its head

        from its neck, but shall not sever it completely.

005:009 He shall sprinkle some of the blood of the sin offering on

        the side of the altar; and the rest of the blood shall be

        drained out at the base of the altar.  It is a sin offering.

005:010 He shall offer the second for a burnt offering, according to

        the ordinance; and the priest shall make atonement for him

        concerning his sin which he has sinned, and he shall be forgiven.

005:011 "'But if he can't afford two turtledoves, or two young pigeons,

        then he shall bring his offering for that in which he has sinned,

        the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a sin offering.

        He shall put no oil on it, neither shall he put any frankincense

        on it, for it is a sin offering.

005:012 He shall bring it to the priest, and the priest shall take

        his handful of it as the memorial portion, and burn it

        on the altar, on the offerings of Yahweh made by fire.

        It is a sin offering.

005:013 The priest shall make atonement for him concerning his sin that

        he has sinned in any of these things, and he will be forgiven;

        and the rest shall be the priest's, as the meal offering.'"

005:014 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

005:015 "If anyone commits a trespass, and sins unwittingly,

        in the holy things of Yahweh; then he shall bring his trespass

        offering to Yahweh, a ram without blemish from the flock,

        according to your estimation in silver by shekels,

        after the shekel of the sanctuary, for a trespass offering.

005:016 He shall make restitution for that which he has done wrong

        in the holy thing, and shall add a fifth part to it,

        and give it to the priest; and the priest shall make

        atonement for him with the ram of the trespass offering,

        and he will be forgiven.

005:017 "If anyone sins, and does any of the things which Yahweh

        has commanded not to be done; though he didn't know it,

        yet he is guilty, and shall bear his iniquity.

005:018 He shall bring a ram without blemish from of the flock,

        according to your estimation, for a trespass offering,

        to the priest; and the priest shall make atonement for him

        concerning the thing in which he sinned and didn't know it,

        and he will be forgiven.

005:019 It is a trespass offering.  He is certainly guilty before Yahweh."

006:001 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

006:002 "If anyone sins, and commits a trespass against Yahweh,

        and deals falsely with his neighbor in a matter of deposit,

        or of bargain, or of robbery, or has oppressed his neighbor,

006:003 or has found that which was lost, and dealt falsely therein,

        and swearing to a lie; in any of all these things that a

        man does, sinning therein;

006:004 then it shall be, if he has sinned, and is guilty, he shall

        restore that which he took by robbery, or the thing which he has

        gotten by oppression, or the deposit which was committed to him,

        or the lost thing which he found,

006:005 or any thing about which he has sworn falsely; he shall restore

        it even in full, and shall add a fifth part more to it.

        To him to whom it belongs he shall give it, in the day of his

        being found guilty.

006:006 He shall bring his trespass offering to Yahweh, a ram without

        blemish from the flock, according to your estimation,

        for a trespass offering, to the priest.

006:007 The priest shall make atonement for him before Yahweh, and he will

        be forgiven concerning whatever he does to become guilty."

006:008 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

006:009 "Command Aaron and his sons, saying, 'This is the law

        of the burnt offering:  the burnt offering shall be on

        the hearth on the altar all night until the morning;

        and the fire of the altar shall be kept burning on it.

006:010 The priest shall put on his linen garment, and he shall put

        on his linen breeches upon his body; and he shall remove

        the ashes from where the fire has consumed the burnt offering

        on the altar, and he shall put them beside the altar.

006:011 He shall take off his garments, and put on other garments,

        and carry the ashes outside the camp to a clean place.

006:012 The fire on the altar shall be kept burning on it, it shall not

        go out; and the priest shall burn wood on it every morning:

        and he shall lay the burnt offering in order upon it,

        and shall burn on it the fat of the peace offerings.

006:013 Fire shall be kept burning on the altar continually;

        it shall not go out.

006:014 "'This is the law of the meal offering:  the sons of Aaron

        shall offer it before Yahweh, before the altar.

006:015 He shall take from there his handful of the fine flour of

        the meal offering, and of its oil, and all the frankincense

        which is on the meal offering, and shall burn it on the altar

        for a sweet savor, as its memorial, to Yahweh.

006:016 That which is left of it Aaron and his sons shall eat.

        It shall be eaten without yeast in a holy place.

        They shall eat it in the court of the Tent of Meeting

006:017 It shall not be baked with yeast.  I have given it as their

        portion of my offerings made by fire.  It is most holy,

        as the sin offering, and as the trespass offering.

006:018 Every male among the children of Aaron shall eat of it,

        as their portion forever throughout your generations,

        from the offerings of Yahweh made by fire.  Whoever touches

        them shall be holy.'"

006:019 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

006:020 "This is the offering of Aaron and of his sons, which they

        shall offer to Yahweh in the day when he is anointed:

        the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a meal

        offering perpetually, half of it in the morning, and half

        of it in the evening.

006:021 It shall be made with oil in a baking pan.  When it is soaked,

        you shall bring it in.  You shall offer the meal offering

        in baked pieces for a sweet savor to Yahweh.

006:022 The anointed priest that will be in his place from among his

        sons shall offer it.  By a statute forever, it shall be wholly

        burnt to Yahweh.

006:023 Every meal offering of a priest shall be wholly burned.

        It shall not be eaten."

006:024 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

006:025 "Speak to Aaron and to his sons, saying, 'This is the law

        of the sin offering:  in the place where the burnt offering

        is killed, the sin offering shall be killed before Yahweh.

        It is most holy.

006:026 The priest who offers it for sin shall eat it.  It shall be

        eaten in a holy place, in the court of the Tent of Meeting.

006:027 Whatever shall touch its flesh shall be holy.  When there

        is any of its blood sprinkled on a garment, you shall wash

        that on which it was sprinkled in a holy place.

006:028 But the earthen vessel in which it is boiled shall be broken;

        and if it is boiled in a bronze vessel, it shall be scoured,

        and rinsed in water.

006:029 Every male among the priests shall eat of it:  it is most holy.

006:030 No sin offering, of which any of the blood is brought into the Tent

        of Meeting to make atonement in the Holy Place, shall be eaten:

        it shall be burned with fire.

007:001 "'This is the law of the trespass offering.  It is most holy.

007:002 In the place where they kill the burnt offering, he shall

        kill the trespass offering; and its blood he shall sprinkle

        on the altar round about.

007:003 He shall offer all of its fat:  the fat tail, and the fat

        that covers the innards,

007:004 and the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is

        by the loins, and the cover on the liver, with the kidneys,

        shall he take away;

007:005 and the priest shall burn them on the altar for an offering

        made by fire to Yahweh:  it is a trespass offering.

007:006 Every male among the priests may eat of it.  It shall be eaten

        in a holy place.  It is most holy.

007:007 "'As is the sin offering, so is the trespass offering;

        there is one law for them.  The priest who makes atonement

        with them shall have it.

007:008 The priest who offers any man's burnt offering, even the priest

        shall have for himself the skin of the burnt offering which

        he has offered.

007:009 Every meal offering that is baked in the oven, and all

        that is dressed in the frying pan, and on the baking pan,

        shall be the priest's who offers it.

007:010 Every meal offering, mixed with oil or dry, belongs to all

        the sons of Aaron, one as well as another.

007:011 "'This is the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings,

        which one shall offer to Yahweh.

007:012 If he offers it for a thanksgiving, then he shall offer

        with the sacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened cakes mixed

        with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and cakes

        mixed with oil.

007:013 With cakes of leavened bread he shall offer his offering

        with the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving.

007:014 Of it he shall offer one out of each offering for a heave

        offering to Yahweh.  It shall be the priest's who sprinkles

        the blood of the peace offerings.

007:015 The flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings for

        thanksgiving shall be eaten on the day of his offering.

        He shall not leave any of it until the morning.

007:016 "'But if the sacrifice of his offering is a vow, or a freewill

        offering, it shall be eaten on the day that he offers his sacrifice;

        and on the next day what remains of it shall be eaten:

007:017 but what remains of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third

        day shall be burned with fire.

007:018 If any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings

        is eaten on the third day, it will not be accepted,

        neither shall it be imputed to him who offers it.

        It will be an abomination, and the soul who eats any of it

        will bear his iniquity.

007:019 "'The flesh that touches any unclean thing shall not be eaten.

        It shall be burned with fire.  As for the flesh, everyone who

        is clean may eat it;

007:020 but the soul who eats of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace

        offerings, that belongs to Yahweh, having his uncleanness on him,

        that soul shall be cut off from his people.

007:021 When anyone touches any unclean thing, the uncleanness of man,

        or an unclean animal, or any unclean abomination, and eats some

        of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which belong

        to Yahweh, that soul shall be cut off from his people.'"

007:022 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

007:023 "Speak to the children of Israel, saying, 'You shall eat no fat,

        of ox, or sheep, or goat.

007:024 The fat of that which dies of itself, and the fat of that

        which is torn of animals, may be used for any other service,

        but you shall in no way eat of it.

007:025 For whoever eats the fat of the animal, of which men offer

        an offering made by fire to Yahweh, even the soul who eats

        it shall be cut off from his people.

007:026 You shall not eat any blood, whether it is of bird or of animal,

        in any of your dwellings.

007:027 Whoever it is who eats any blood, that soul shall be cut off

        from his people.'"

007:028 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

007:029 "Speak to the children of Israel, saying, 'He who offers

        the sacrifice of his peace offerings to Yahweh shall bring his

        offering to Yahweh out of the sacrifice of his peace offerings.

007:030 With his own hands he shall bring the offerings of Yahweh

        made by fire.  He shall bring the fat with the breast,

        that the breast may be waved for a wave offering before Yahweh.

007:031 The priest shall burn the fat on the altar, but the breast

        shall be Aaron's and his sons'.

007:032 The right thigh you shall give to the priest for a heave

        offering out of the sacrifices of your peace offerings.

007:033 He among the sons of Aaron who offers the blood of the

        peace offerings, and the fat, shall have the right thigh

        for a portion.

007:034 For the waved breast and the heaved thigh I have taken from the

        children of Israel out of the sacrifices of their peace offerings,

        and have given them to Aaron the priest and to his sons

        as their portion forever from the children of Israel.'"

007:035 This is the anointing portion of Aaron, and the anointing portion

        of his sons, out of the offerings of Yahweh made by fire,

        in the day when he presented them to minister to Yahweh

        in the priest's office;

007:036 which Yahweh commanded to be given them of the children of Israel,

        in the day that he anointed them.  It is their portion forever

        throughout their generations.

007:037 This is the law of the burnt offering, of the meal offering,

        and of the sin offering, and of the trespass offering,

        and of the consecration, and of the sacrifice of peace offerings;

007:038 which Yahweh commanded Moses in Mount Sinai, in the day that

        he commanded the children of Israel to offer their offerings

        to Yahweh, in the wilderness of Sinai.

008:001 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

008:002 "Take Aaron and his sons with him, and the garments,

        and the anointing oil, and the bull of the sin offering,

        and the two rams, and the basket of unleavened bread;

008:003 and assemble all the congregation at the door of the

        Tent of Meeting."

008:004 Moses did as Yahweh commanded him; and the congregation was

        assembled at the door of the Tent of Meeting.

008:005 Moses said to the congregation, "This is the thing which Yahweh

        has commanded to be done."

008:006 Moses brought Aaron and his sons, and washed them with water.

008:007 He put the coat on him, tied the sash on him, clothed him

        with the robe, put the ephod on him, and he tied the skillfully

        woven band of the ephod on him, and fastened it to him with it.

008:008 He placed the breastplate on him; and in the breastplate he put

        the Urim and the Thummim.

008:009 He set the turban on his head; and on the turban, in front,

        he set the golden plate, the holy crown; as Yahweh commanded Moses.

008:010 Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle

        and all that was in it, and sanctified them.

008:011 He sprinkled it on the altar seven times, and anointed

        the altar and all its vessels, and the basin and its base,

        to sanctify them.

008:012 He poured some of the anointing oil on Aaron's head,

        and anointed him, to sanctify him.

008:013 Moses brought Aaron's sons, and clothed them with coats,

        and tied sashes on them, and put headbands on them;

        as Yahweh commanded Moses.

008:014 He brought the bull of the sin offering, and Aaron and his sons

        laid their hands on the head of the bull of the sin offering.

008:015 He killed it; and Moses took the blood, and put it on the horns

        of the altar round about with his finger, and purified

        the altar, and poured out the blood at the base of the altar,

        and sanctified it, to make atonement for it.

008:016 He took all the fat that was on the innards, and the cover

        of the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat; and Moses

        burned it on the altar.

008:017 But the bull, and its skin, and its flesh, and its dung,

        he burned with fire outside the camp; as Yahweh commanded Moses.

008:018 He presented the ram of the burnt offering:  and Aaron and his

        sons laid their hands on the head of the ram.

008:019 He killed it; and Moses sprinkled the blood on the altar round about.

008:020 He cut the ram into its pieces; and Moses burned the head,

        and the pieces, and the fat.

008:021 He washed the innards and the legs with water; and Moses

        burned the whole ram on the altar.  It was a burnt offering

        for a sweet savor.  It was an offering made by fire to Yahweh;

        as Yahweh commanded Moses.

008:022 He presented the other ram, the ram of consecration:

        and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram.

008:023 He killed it; and Moses took some of its blood, and put it on

        the tip of Aaron's right ear, and on the thumb of his right hand,

        and on the great toe of his right foot.

008:024 He brought Aaron's sons; and Moses put some of the blood

        on the tip of their right ear, and on the thumb of their

        right hand, and on the great toe of their right foot;

        and Moses sprinkled the blood on the altar round about.

008:025 He took the fat, and the fat tail, and all the fat that was on

        the innards, and the cover of the liver, and the two kidneys,

        and their fat, and the right thigh;

008:026 and out of the basket of unleavened bread, that was before Yahweh,

        he took one unleavened cake, and one cake of oiled bread,

        and one wafer, and placed them on the fat, and on the right thigh.

008:027 He put all these in Aaron's hands and in his sons' hands, and waved

        them for a wave offering before Yahweh.

008:028 Moses took them from their hands, and burned them on the altar on

        the burnt offering.  They were a consecration for a sweet savor.

        It was an offering made by fire to Yahweh.

008:029 Moses took the breast, and waved it for a wave offering

        before Yahweh.  It was Moses' portion of the ram of consecration,

        as Yahweh commanded Moses.

008:030 Moses took some of the anointing oil, and some of the blood which

        was on the altar, and sprinkled it on Aaron, on his garments,

        and on his sons, and on his sons' garments with him,

        and sanctified Aaron, his garments, and his sons, and his sons'

        garments with him.

008:031 Moses said to Aaron and to his sons, "Boil the flesh at the door

        of the Tent of Meeting, and there eat it and the bread that

        is in the basket of consecration, as I commanded, saying,

        'Aaron and his sons shall eat it.'

008:032 What remains of the flesh and of the bread you shall

        burn with fire.

008:033 You shall not go out from the door of the Tent of Meeting

        seven days, until the days of your consecration are fulfilled:

        for he shall consecrate you seven days.

008:034 What has been done this day, so Yahweh has commanded to do,

        to make atonement for you.

008:035 At the door of the Tent of Meeting you shall stay day and night

        seven days, and keep the charge of Yahweh, that you don't die:

        for so I am commanded."

008:036 Aaron and his sons did all the things which Yahweh

        commanded by Moses.

009:001 It happened on the eighth day, that Moses called Aaron and his sons,

        and the elders of Israel;

009:002 and he said to Aaron, "Take a calf from the herd for a sin offering,

        and a ram for a burnt offering, without blemish, and offer

        them before Yahweh.

009:003 You shall speak to the children of Israel, saying, 'Take a male

        goat for a sin offering; and a calf and a lamb, both a year old,

        without blemish, for a burnt offering;

009:004 and an ox and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice

        before Yahweh; and a meal offering mixed with oil:

        for today Yahweh appears to you.'"

009:005 They brought what Moses commanded before the Tent of Meeting:

        and all the congregation drew near and stood before Yahweh.

009:006 Moses said, "This is the thing which Yahweh commanded that you

        should do:  and the glory of Yahweh shall appear to you."

009:007 Moses said to Aaron, "Draw near to the altar, and offer

        your sin offering, and your burnt offering, and make

        atonement for yourself, and for the people; and offer

        the offering of the people, and make atonement for them;

        as Yahweh commanded."

009:008 So Aaron drew near to the altar, and killed the calf of

        the sin offering, which was for himself.

009:009 The sons of Aaron presented the blood to him; and he dipped

        his finger in the blood, and put it on the horns of the altar,

        and poured out the blood at the base of the altar:

009:010 but the fat, and the kidneys, and the cover from

        the liver of the sin offering, he burned upon the altar;

        as Yahweh commanded Moses.

009:011 The flesh and the skin he burned with fire outside the camp.

009:012 He killed the burnt offering; and Aaron's sons delivered the blood

        to him, and he sprinkled it on the altar round about.

009:013 They delivered the burnt offering to him, piece by piece,

        and the head:  and he burned them upon the altar.

009:014 He washed the innards and the legs, and burned them on the burnt

        offering on the altar.

009:015 He presented the people's offering, and took the goat of

        the sin offering which was for the people, and killed it,

        and offered it for sin, like the first.

009:016 He presented the burnt offering, and offered it according

        to the ordinance.

009:017 He presented the meal offering, and filled his hand from there,

        and burned it upon the altar, besides the burnt offering

        of the morning.

009:018 He also killed the ox and the ram, the sacrifice of peace offerings,

        which was for the people:  and Aaron's sons delivered to him

        the blood, which he sprinkled on the altar round about,

009:019 and the fat of the ox and of the ram, the fat tail, and that

        which covers the innards, and the kidneys, and the cover

        of the liver:

009:020 and they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burned the fat

        on the altar:

009:021 and the breasts and the right thigh Aaron waved for a wave

        offering before Yahweh, as Moses commanded.

009:022 Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people, and blessed them;

        and he came down from offering the sin offering, and the

        burnt offering, and the peace offerings.

009:023 Moses and Aaron went into the Tent of Meeting, and came out,

        and blessed the people:  and the glory of Yahweh appeared

        to all the people.

009:024 There came forth fire from before Yahweh, and consumed the burnt

        offering and the fat upon the altar:  and when all the people

        saw it, they shouted, and fell on their faces.

010:001 Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, each took his censer,

        and put fire in it, and laid incense on it, and offered strange

        fire before Yahweh, which he had not commanded them.

010:002 And fire came forth from before Yahweh, and devoured them,

        and they died before Yahweh.

010:003 Then Moses said to Aaron, "This is what Yahweh spoke of,

        saying, 'I will show myself holy to those who come near me,

        and before all the people I will be glorified.'"

        Aaron held his peace.

010:004 Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the uncle

        of Aaron, and said to them, "Draw near, carry your brothers

        from before the sanctuary out of the camp."

010:005 So they drew near, and carried them in their coats out of the camp,

        as Moses had said.

010:006 Moses said to Aaron, and to Eleazar and to Ithamar, his sons,

        "Don't let the hair of your heads go loose, neither tear

        your clothes; that you don't die, and that he not be angry

        with all the congregation:  but let your brothers, the whole

        house of Israel, bewail the burning which Yahweh has kindled.

010:007 You shall not go out from the door of the Tent of Meeting,

        lest you die; for the anointing oil of Yahweh is on you."

        They did according to the word of Moses.

010:008 Yahweh spoke to Aaron, saying,

010:009 "Drink no wine nor strong drink, you, nor your sons with you,

        when you go into the Tent of Meeting, that you don't die:

        it shall be a statute forever throughout your generations:

010:010 and that you are to make a distinction between the holy

        and the common, and between the unclean and the clean;

010:011 and that you are to teach the children of Israel all the statutes

        which Yahweh has spoken to them by Moses."

010:012 Moses spoke to Aaron, and to Eleazar and to Ithamar,

        his sons who were left, "Take the meal offering that remains

        of the offerings of Yahweh made by fire, and eat it without

        yeast beside the altar; for it is most holy;

010:013 and you shall eat it in a holy place, because it is your portion,

        and your sons' portion, of the offerings of Yahweh made by fire:

        for so I am commanded.

010:014 The waved breast and the heaved thigh you shall eat in a

        clean place, you, and your sons, and your daughters with you:

        for they are given as your portion, and your sons' portion, out of

        the sacrifices of the peace offerings of the children of Israel.

010:015 The heaved thigh and the waved breast they shall bring with

        the offerings made by fire of the fat, to wave it for a wave

        offering before Yahweh:  and it shall be yours, and your sons'

        with you, as a portion forever; as Yahweh has commanded."

010:016 Moses diligently inquired about the goat of the sin offering,

        and, behold, it was burned:  and he was angry with Eleazar

        and with Ithamar, the sons of Aaron who were left, saying,

010:017 "Why haven't you eaten the sin offering in the place of

        the sanctuary, seeing it is most holy, and he has given it you

        to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement

        for them before Yahweh?

010:018 Behold, its blood was not brought into the inner part of

        the sanctuary:  you certainly should have eaten it in the sanctuary,

        as I commanded."

010:019 Aaron spoke to Moses, "Behold, this day they have offered

        their sin offering and their burnt offering before Yahweh;

        and such things as these have happened to me:  and if I had

        eaten the sin offering today, would it have been pleasing

        in the sight of Yahweh?"

010:020 When Moses heard that, it was pleasing in his sight.

011:001 Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying to them,

011:002 "Speak to the children of Israel, saying, 'These are the living

        things which you may eat among all the animals that are

        on the earth.

011:003 Whatever parts the hoof, and is cloven-footed, and chews

        the cud among the animals, that you may eat.

011:004 "'Nevertheless these you shall not eat of those that chew

        the cud, or of those who part the hoof:  the camel,

        because he chews the cud but doesn't have a parted hoof,

        he is unclean to you.

011:005 The coney, because he chews the cud but doesn't have a parted hoof,

        he is unclean to you.

011:006 The hare, because she chews the cud but doesn't part the hoof,

        she is unclean to you.

011:007 The pig, because he has a split hoof, and is cloven-footed,

        but doesn't chew the cud, he is unclean to you.

011:008 Of their flesh you shall not eat, and their carcasses you

        shall not touch; they are unclean to you.

011:009 "'These you may eat of all that are in the waters:

        whatever has fins and scales in the waters, in the seas,

        and in the rivers, that you may eat.

011:010 All that don't have fins and scales in the seas, and in the rivers,

        of all that move in the waters, and of all the living creatures

        that are in the waters, they are an abomination to you,

011:011 and you detest them.  You shall not eat of their flesh,

        and you shall detest their carcasses.

011:012 Whatever has no fins nor scales in the waters, that is an

        abomination to you.

011:013 "'These you shall detest among the birds; they shall not be eaten,

        they are an abomination:  the eagle, and the vulture,

        and the black vulture,

011:014 and the red kite, any kind of black kite,

011:015 any kind of raven,

011:016 the horned owl, the screech owl, and the gull, any kind of hawk,

011:017 the little owl, the cormorant, the great owl,

011:018 the white owl, the desert owl, the osprey,

011:019 the stork, any kind of heron, the hoopoe, and the bat.

011:020 "'All flying insects that walk on all fours are an

        abomination to you.

011:021 Yet you may eat these:  of all winged creeping things

        that go on all fours, which have legs above their feet,

        with which to hop on the earth.

011:022 Even of these you may eat:  any kind of locust, any kind of katydid,

        any kind of cricket, and any kind of grasshopper.

011:023 But all winged creeping things which have four feet,

        are an abomination to you.

011:024 "'By these you will become unclean:  whoever touches the carcass

        of them shall be unclean until the evening.

011:025 Whoever carries any part of their carcass shall wash his clothes,

        and be unclean until the evening.

011:026 "'Every animal which parts the hoof, and is not cloven-footed,

        nor chews the cud, is unclean to you.  Everyone who touches

        them shall be unclean.

011:027 Whatever goes on its paws, among all animals that go on all fours,

        they are unclean to you.  Whoever touches their carcass shall

        be unclean until the evening.

011:028 He who carries their carcass shall wash his clothes, and be

        unclean until the evening.  They are unclean to you.

011:029 "'These are they which are unclean to you among the creeping

        things that creep on the earth:  the weasel, the rat,

        any kind of great lizard,

011:030 the gecko, and the monitor lizard, the wall lizard, the skink,

        and the chameleon.

011:031 These are they which are unclean to you among all that creep.

        Whoever touches them when they are dead, shall be unclean

        until the evening.

011:032 On whatever any of them falls when they are dead, it shall be unclean;

        whether it is any vessel of wood, or clothing, or skin, or sack,

        whatever vessel it is, with which any work is done, it must

        be put into water, and it shall be unclean until the evening;

        then it will be clean.

011:033 Every earthen vessel, into which any of them falls, all that is

        in it shall be unclean, and you shall break it.

011:034 All food which may be eaten, that on which water comes,

        shall be unclean; and all drink that may be drunk in every

        such vessel shall be unclean.

011:035 Everything whereupon part of their carcass falls shall be unclean;

        whether oven, or range for pots, it shall be broken in pieces:

        they are unclean, and shall be unclean to you.

011:036 Nevertheless a spring or a cistern in which water is a gathered

        shall be clean:  but that which touches their carcass

        shall be unclean.

011:037 If part of their carcass falls on any sowing seed which is

        to be sown, it is clean.

011:038 But if water is put on the seed, and part of their carcass

        falls on it, it is unclean to you.

011:039 "'If any animal, of which you may eat, dies; he who touches

        its carcass shall be unclean until the evening.

011:040 He who eats of its carcass shall wash his clothes, and be

        unclean until the evening.  He also who carries its carcass

        shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the evening.

011:041 "'Every creeping thing that creeps on the earth is an abomination.

        It shall not be eaten.

011:042 Whatever goes on its belly, and whatever goes on all fours,

        or whatever has many feet, even all creeping things

        that creep on the earth, them you shall not eat; for they

        are an abomination.

011:043 You shall not make yourselves abominable with any creeping

        thing that creeps, neither shall you make yourselves unclean

        with them, that you should be defiled thereby.

011:044 For I am Yahweh your God.  Sanctify yourselves therefore,

        and be holy; for I am holy:  neither shall you defile yourselves

        with any kind of creeping thing that moves on the earth.

011:045 For I am Yahweh who brought you up out of the land of Egypt,

        to be your God.  You shall therefore be holy, for I am holy.

011:046 "'This is the law of the animal, and of the bird, and of every

        living creature that moves in the waters, and of every creature

        that creeps on the earth,

011:047 to make a distinction between the unclean and the clean,

        and between the living thing that may be eaten and the living

        thing that may not be eaten.'"

012:001 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

012:002 "Speak to the children of Israel, saying, 'If a woman conceives,

        and bears a male child, then she shall be unclean seven days;

        as in the days of her monthly period she shall be unclean.

012:003 In the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be circumcised.

012:004 She shall continue in the blood of purification thirty-three days.

        She shall not touch any holy thing, nor come into the sanctuary,

        until the days of her purifying are completed.

012:005 But if she bears a female child, then she shall be unclean

        two weeks, as in her period; and she shall continue in the blood

        of purification sixty-six days.

012:006 "'When the days of her purification are completed, for a son,

        or for a daughter, she shall bring to the priest at the door

        of the Tent of Meeting, a year old lamb for a burnt offering,

        and a young pigeon, or a turtledove, for a sin offering:

012:007 and he shall offer it before Yahweh, and make atonement for her;

        and she shall be cleansed from the fountain of her blood.

        "'This is the law for her who bears, whether a male or a female.

012:008 If she cannot afford a lamb, then she shall take two turtledoves,

        or two young pigeons; the one for a burnt offering,

        and the other for a sin offering:  and the priest shall make

        atonement for her, and she shall be clean.'"

013:001 Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,

013:002 "When a man shall have a rising in his body's skin, or a scab,

        or a bright spot, and it becomes in the skin of his body

        the plague of leprosy, then he shall be brought to Aaron

        the priest, or to one of his sons the priests:

013:003 and the priest shall examine the plague in the skin of the body:

        and if the hair in the plague has turned white, and the

        appearance of the plague is deeper than the body's skin,

        it is the plague of leprosy; and the priest shall examine him,

        and pronounce him unclean.

013:004 If the bright spot is white in the skin of his body,

        and the appearance of it isn't deeper than the skin,

        and the hair of it hasn't turned white, then the priest shall

        isolate the infected person for seven days.

013:005 The priest shall examine him on the seventh day, and, behold,

        if in his eyes the plague is arrested, and the plague hasn't

        spread in the skin, then the priest shall isolate him for

        seven more days.

013:006 The priest shall examine him again on the seventh day;

        and behold, if the plague has faded, and the plague hasn't

        spread in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him clean.

        It is a scab.  He shall wash his clothes, and be clean.

013:007 But if the scab spreads on the skin, after he has shown himself

        to the priest for his cleansing, he shall show himself

        to the priest again.

013:008 The priest shall examine him; and behold, if the scab has spread

        on the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean.

        It is leprosy.

013:009 "When the plague of leprosy is in a man, then he shall be

        brought to the priest;

013:010 and the priest shall examine him.  Behold, if there is a white

        rising in the skin, and it has turned the hair white,

        and there is raw flesh in the rising,

013:011 it is a chronic leprosy in the skin of his body, and the priest

        shall pronounce him unclean.  He shall not isolate him,

        for he is unclean.

013:012 "If the leprosy breaks out all over the skin, and the leprosy

        covers all the skin of the infected person from his head

        even to his feet, as far as it appears to the priest;

013:013 then the priest shall examine him; and, behold, if the leprosy has

        covered all his flesh, he shall pronounce him clean of the plague.

        It has all turned white:  he is clean.

013:014 But whenever raw flesh appears in him, he shall be unclean.

013:015 The priest shall examine the raw flesh, and pronounce him unclean:

        the raw flesh is unclean.  It is leprosy.

013:016 Or if the raw flesh turns again, and is changed to white,

        then he shall come to the priest;

013:017 and the priest shall examine him; and, behold, if the plague

        has turned white, then the priest shall pronounce him clean

        of the plague.  He is clean.

013:018 "When the body has a boil on its skin, and it has healed,

013:019 and in the place of the boil there is a white rising,

        or a bright spot, reddish-white, then it shall be shown

        to the priest;

013:020 and the priest shall examine it; and behold, if the appearance

        of it is lower than the skin, and the hair of it has

        turned white, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean.

        It is the plague of leprosy.  It has broken out in the boil.

013:021 But if the priest examines it, and behold, there are no white

        hairs in it, and it isn't deeper than the skin, but is dim,

        then the priest shall isolate him seven days.

013:022 If it spreads in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce

        him unclean.  It is a plague.

013:023 But if the bright spot stays in its place, and hasn't spread,

        it is the scar from the boil; and the priest shall

        pronounce him clean.

013:024 "Or when the body has a burn from fire on its skin, and the raw

        flesh of the burn becomes a bright spot, reddish-white, or white,

013:025 then the priest shall examine it; and behold, if the hair

        in the bright spot has turned white, and the appearance of it

        is deeper than the skin; it is leprosy.  It has broken out

        in the burning, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean.

        It is the plague of leprosy.

013:026 But if the priest examines it, and behold, there is no white

        hair in the bright spot, and it isn't lower than the skin,

        but is faded; then the priest shall isolate him seven days.

013:027 The priest shall examine him on the seventh day.  If it has spread

        in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean.

        It is the plague of leprosy.

013:028 If the bright spot stays in its place, and hasn't spread

        in the skin, but is faded, it is the swelling from the burn,

        and the priest shall pronounce him clean; for it is the scar

        from the burn.

013:029 "When a man or woman has a plague on the head or on the beard,

013:030 then the priest shall examine the plague; and behold, if the

        appearance of it is deeper than the skin, and the hair in it

        is yellow and thin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean:

        it is an itch, it is leprosy of the head or of the beard.

013:031 If the priest examines the plague of itching, and behold,

        its appearance isn't deeper than the skin, and there is no

        black hair in it, then the priest shall isolate him the person

        infected with itching seven days.

013:032 On the seventh day the priest shall examine the plague; and behold,

        if the itch hasn't spread, and there is no yellow hair in it,

        and the appearance of the itch isn't deeper than the skin,

013:033 then he shall be shaved, but he shall not shave the itch;

        and the priest shall shut him up who has the itch seven more days.

013:034 On the seventh day, the priest shall examine the itch; and behold,

        if the itch hasn't spread in the skin, and its appearance isn't

        deeper than the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him clean.

        He shall wash his clothes, and be clean.

013:035 But if the itch spreads in the skin after his cleansing,

013:036 then the priest shall examine him; and behold, if the itch has

        spread in the skin, the priest shall not look for the yellow hair;

        he is unclean.

013:037 But if in his eyes the itch is arrested, and black hair

        has grown in it; the itch is healed, he is clean.

        The priest shall pronounce him clean.

013:038 "When a man or a woman has bright spots in the skin of the body,

        even white bright spots;

013:039 then the priest shall examine them; and behold, if the bright

        spots on the skin of their body are a dull white,

        it is a harmless rash, it has broken out in the skin;

        he is clean.

013:040 "If a man's hair has fallen from his head, he is bald.

        He is clean.

013:041 If his hair has fallen off from the front part of his head,

        he is forehead bald.  He is clean.

013:042 But if there is in the bald head, or the bald forehead,

        a reddish-white plague; it is leprosy breaking out in his

        bald head, or his bald forehead.

013:043 Then the priest shall examine him; and, behold, if the rising

        of the plague is reddish-white in his bald head, or in his

        bald forehead, like the appearance of leprosy in the skin

        of the flesh,

013:044 he is a leprous man.  He is unclean.  The priest shall surely

        pronounce him unclean.  His plague is on his head.

013:045 "The leper in whom the plague is shall wear torn clothes,

        and the hair of his head shall hang loose.  He shall cover

        his upper lip, and shall cry, 'Unclean!  Unclean!'

013:046 All the days in which the plague is in him he shall be unclean.

        He is unclean.  He shall dwell alone.  Outside of the camp

        shall be his dwelling.

013:047 "The garment also that the plague of leprosy is in, whether it

        is a woolen garment, or a linen garment;

013:048 whether it is in warp, or woof; of linen, or of wool;

        whether in a skin, or in anything made of skin;

013:049 if the plague is greenish or reddish in the garment, or in the skin,

        or in the warp, or in the woof, or in anything made of skin;

        it is the plague of leprosy, and shall be shown to the priest.

013:050 The priest shall examine the plague, and isolate the

        plague seven days.

013:051 He shall examine the plague on the seventh day.

        If the plague has spread in the garment, either in the warp,

        or in the woof, or in the skin, whatever use the skin

        is used for, the plague is a destructive mildew.

        It is unclean.

013:052 He shall burn the garment, whether the warp or the woof, in wool

        or in linen, or anything of skin, in which the plague is:

        for it is a destructive mildew.  It shall be burned in the fire.

013:053 "If the priest examines it, and behold, the plague hasn't

        spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof,

        or in anything of skin;

013:054 then the priest shall command that they wash the thing in which

        the plague is, and he shall isolate it seven more days.

013:055 Then the priest shall examine it, after the plague is washed;

        and behold, if the plague hasn't changed its color, and the plague

        hasn't spread, it is unclean; you shall burn it in the fire.

        It is a mildewed spot, whether the bareness is inside or outside.

013:056 If the priest looks, and behold, the plague has faded after

        it is washed, then he shall tear it out of the garment,

        or out of the skin, or out of the warp, or out of the woof:

013:057 and if it appears again in the garment, either in the warp,

        or in the woof, or in anything of skin, it is spreading.

        You shall burn with fire that in which the plague is.

013:058 The garment, either the warp, or the woof, or whatever thing

        of skin it is, which you shall wash, if the plague has

        departed from them, then it shall be washed the second time,

        and it will be clean."

013:059 This is the law of the plague of mildew in a garment of wool

        or linen, either in the warp, or the woof, or in anything of skin,

        to pronounce it clean, or to pronounce it unclean.

014:001 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

014:002 "This shall be the law of the leper in the day of his cleansing.

        He shall be brought to the priest,

014:003 and the priest shall go forth out of the camp.  The priest shall

        examine him, and behold, if the plague of leprosy is healed

        in the leper,

014:004 then the priest shall command them to take for him who is

        to be cleansed two living clean birds, and cedar wood,

        and scarlet, and hyssop.

014:005 The priest shall command them to kill one of the birds in an

        earthen vessel over running water.

014:006 As for the living bird, he shall take it, and the cedar wood,

        and the scarlet, and the hyssop, and shall dip them and

        the living bird in the blood of the bird that was killed

        over the running water.

014:007 He shall sprinkle on him who is to be cleansed from the leprosy

        seven times, and shall pronounce him clean, and shall let

        the living bird go into the open field.

014:008 "He who is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes, and shave off

        all his hair, and bathe himself in water; and he shall be clean.

        After that he shall come into the camp, but shall dwell

        outside his tent seven days.

014:009 It shall be on the seventh day, that he shall shave all his

        hair off his head and his beard and his eyebrows, even all

        his hair he shall shave off.  He shall wash his clothes,

        and he shall bathe his body in water, then he shall be clean.

014:010 "On the eighth day he shall take two male lambs without blemish,

        and one ewe lamb a year old without blemish, and three tenths

        of an ephah of fine flour for a meal offering, mingled with oil,

        and one log of oil.

014:011 The priest who cleanses him shall set the man who is to

        be cleansed, and those things, before Yahweh, at the door

        of the Tent of Meeting.

014:012 "The priest shall take one of the male lambs, and offer him

        for a trespass offering, with the log of oil, and wave them

        for a wave offering before Yahweh.

014:013 He shall kill the male lamb in the place where they kill

        the sin offering and the burnt offering, in the place

        of the sanctuary; for as the sin offering is the priest's,

        so is the trespass offering.  It is most holy.

014:014 The priest shall take some of the blood of the trespass offering,

        and the priest shall put it on the tip of the right ear of him

        who is to be cleansed, and on the thumb of his right hand,

        and on the big toe of his right foot.

014:015 The priest shall take some of the log of oil, and pour it

        into the palm of his own left hand.

014:016 The priest shall dip his right finger in the oil that is in his

        left hand, and shall sprinkle some of the oil with his finger

        seven times before Yahweh.

014:017 The priest shall put some of the rest of the oil that is in his

        hand on the tip of the right ear of him who is to be cleansed,

        and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his

        right foot, upon the blood of the trespass offering.

014:018 The rest of the oil that is in the priest's hand he shall put

        on the head of him who is to be cleansed, and the priest

        shall make atonement for him before Yahweh.

014:019 "The priest shall offer the sin offering, and make atonement

        for him who is to be cleansed because of his uncleanness:

        and afterward he shall kill the burnt offering;

014:020 and the priest shall offer the burnt offering and the meal

        offering on the altar.  The priest shall make atonement for him,

        and he shall be clean.

014:021 "If he is poor, and can't afford so much, then he shall

        take one male lamb for a trespass offering to be waved,

        to make atonement for him, and one tenth of an ephah of fine

        flour mingled with oil for a meal offering, and a log of oil;

014:022 and two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, such as he is able

        to afford; and the one shall be a sin offering, and the other

        a burnt offering.

014:023 "On the eighth day he shall bring them for his cleansing to

        the priest, to the door of the Tent of Meeting, before Yahweh.

014:024 The priest shall take the lamb of the trespass offering,

        and the log of oil, and the priest shall wave them for a wave

        offering before Yahweh.

014:025 He shall kill the lamb of the trespass offering.

        The priest shall take some of the blood of the trespass

        offering and put it on the tip of the right ear of him

        who is to be cleansed, and on the thumb of his right hand,

        and on the big toe of his right foot.

014:026 The priest shall pour some of the oil into the palm of his

        own left hand;

014:027 and the priest shall sprinkle with his right finger some of

        the oil that is in his left hand seven times before Yahweh.

014:028 Then the priest shall put some of the oil that is in his hand

        on the tip of the right ear of him who is to be cleansed,

        and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his

        right foot, on the place of the blood of the trespass offering.

014:029 The rest of the oil that is in the priest's hand he shall put

        on the head of him who is to be cleansed, to make atonement

        for him before Yahweh.

014:030 He shall offer one of the turtledoves, or of the young pigeons,

        such as he is able to afford,

014:031 even such as he is able to afford, the one for a sin offering,

        and the other for a burnt offering, with the meal offering.

        The priest shall make atonement for him who is to be

        cleansed before Yahweh."

014:032 This is the law for him in whom is the plague of leprosy,

        who is not able to afford the sacrifice for his cleansing.

014:033 Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,

014:034 "When you have come into the land of Canaan, which I give to you

        for a possession, and I put a spreading mildew in a house

        in the land of your possession,

014:035 then he who owns the house shall come and tell the priest, saying,

        'There seems to me to be some sort of plague in the house.'

014:036 The priest shall command that they empty the house,

        before the priest goes in to examine the plague,

        that all that is in the house not be made unclean:

        and afterward the priest shall go in to inspect the house.

014:037 He shall examine the plague; and behold, if the plague is in

        the walls of the house with hollow streaks, greenish or reddish,

        and it appears to be deeper than the wall;

014:038 then the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the house,

        and shut up the house seven days.

014:039 The priest shall come again on the seventh day, and look.

        If the plague has spread in the walls of the house,

014:040 then the priest shall command that they take out the stones

        in which is the plague, and cast them into an unclean place

        outside of the city:

014:041 and he shall cause the inside of the house to be scraped round about,

        and they shall pour out the mortar, that they scraped off,

        outside of the city into an unclean place.

014:042 They shall take other stones, and put them in the place

        of those stones; and he shall take other mortar, and shall

        plaster the house.

014:043 "If the plague comes again, and breaks out in the house,

        after he has taken out the stones, and after he has scraped

        the house, and after it was plastered;

014:044 then the priest shall come in and look; and behold, if the plague

        has spread in the house, it is a destructive mildew in the house.

        It is unclean.

014:045 He shall break down the house, its stones, and its timber,

        and all the house's mortar.  He shall carry them out of the city

        into an unclean place.

014:046 "Moreover he who goes into the house while it is shut up shall

        be unclean until the evening.

014:047 He who lies down in the house shall wash his clothes;

        and he who eats in the house shall wash his clothes.

014:048 "If the priest shall come in, and examine it, and behold,

        the plague hasn't spread in the house, after the house

        was plastered, then the priest shall pronounce the house clean,

        because the plague is healed.

014:049 To cleanse the house he shall take two birds, and cedar wood,

        and scarlet, and hyssop.

014:050 He shall kill one of the birds in an earthen vessel

        over running water.

014:051 He shall take the cedar wood, and the hyssop, and the scarlet,

        and the living bird, and dip them in the blood of the slain bird,

        and in the running water, and sprinkle the house seven times.

014:052 He shall cleanse the house with the blood of the bird, and with

        the running water, with the living bird, with the cedar wood,

        with the hyssop, and with the scarlet;

014:053 but he shall let the living bird go out of the city into

        the open field.  So shall he make atonement for the house;

        and it shall be clean."

014:054 This is the law for any plague of leprosy, and for an itch,

014:055 and for the destructive mildew of a garment, and for a house,

014:056 and for a rising, and for a scab, and for a bright spot;

014:057 to teach when it is unclean, and when it is clean.

        This is the law of leprosy.

015:001 Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,

015:002 "Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them, 'When any

        man has a discharge from his body, because of his discharge

        he is unclean.

015:003 This shall be his uncleanness in his discharge:

        whether his body runs with his discharge, or his body has

        stopped from his discharge, it is his uncleanness.

015:004 "'Every bed whereon he who has the discharge lies shall be unclean;

        and everything he sits on shall be unclean.

015:005 Whoever touches his bed shall wash his clothes, and bathe

        himself in water, and be unclean until the evening.

015:006 He who sits on anything whereon the man who has the discharge

        sat shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water,

        and be unclean until the evening.

015:007 "'He who touches the body of him who has the discharge shall

        wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean

        until the evening.

015:008 "'If he who has the discharge spits on him who is clean,

        then he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water,

        and be unclean until the evening.

015:009 "'Whatever saddle he who has the discharge rides on

        shall be unclean.

015:010 Whoever touches anything that was under him shall be unclean

        until the evening.  He who carries those things shall wash

        his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean

        until the evening.

015:011 "'Whoever he who has the discharge touches, without having

        rinsed his hands in water, he shall wash his clothes,

        and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the evening.

015:012 "'The earthen vessel, which he who has the discharge touches,

        shall be broken; and every vessel of wood shall be rinsed in water.

015:013 "'When he who has a discharge is cleansed of his discharge,

        then he shall count to himself seven days for his cleansing,

        and wash his clothes; and he shall bathe his flesh in running water,

        and shall be clean.

015:014 "'On the eighth day he shall take two turtledoves, or two

        young pigeons, and come before Yahweh to the door of the Tent

        of Meeting, and give them to the priest:

015:015 and the priest shall offer them, the one for a sin offering,

        and the other for a burnt offering.  The priest shall make

        atonement for him before Yahweh for his discharge.

015:016 "'If any man has an emission of semen, then he shall bathe

        all his flesh in water, and be unclean until the evening.

015:017 Every garment, and every skin, whereon the semen is, shall be

        washed with water, and be unclean until the evening.

015:018 If a man lies with a woman and there is an emission of semen,

        they shall both bathe themselves in water, and be unclean

        until the evening.

015:019 "'If a woman has a discharge, and her discharge in her

        flesh is blood, she shall be in her impurity seven days:

        and whoever touches her shall be unclean until the evening.

015:020 "'Everything that she lies on in her impurity shall be unclean.

        Everything also that she sits on shall be unclean.

015:021 Whoever touches her bed shall wash his clothes, and bathe

        himself in water, and be unclean until the evening.

015:022 Whoever touches anything that she sits on shall wash his clothes,

        and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the evening.

015:023 If it is on the bed, or on anything whereon she sits,

        when he touches it, he shall be unclean until the evening.

015:024 "'If any man lies with her, and her monthly flow is on him,

        he shall be unclean seven days; and every bed whereon he lies

        shall be unclean.

015:025 "'If a woman has a discharge of her blood many days not

        in the time of her period, or if she has a discharge beyond

        the time of her period; all the days of the discharge

        of her uncleanness shall be as in the days of her period:

        she is unclean.

015:026 Every bed whereon she lies all the days of her discharge shall

        be to her as the bed of her period:  and everything whereon

        she sits shall be unclean, as the uncleanness of her period.

015:027 Whoever touches these things shall be unclean, and shall wash

        his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean

        until the evening.

015:028 "'But if she is cleansed of her discharge, then she shall count

        to herself seven days, and after that she shall be clean.

015:029 On the eighth day she shall take two turtledoves, or two

        young pigeons, and bring them to the priest, to the door

        of the Tent of Meeting.

015:030 The priest shall offer the one for a sin offering, and the other

        for a burnt offering; and the priest shall make atonement

        for her before Yahweh for the uncleanness of her discharge.

015:031 "'Thus you shall separate the children of Israel from

        their uncleanness, so they will not die in their uncleanness,

        when they defile my tabernacle that is in their midst.'"

015:032 This is the law of him who has a discharge, and of him who has

        an emission of semen, so that he is unclean thereby;

015:033 and of her who has her period, and of a man or woman who has

        a discharge, and of him who lies with her who is unclean.

016:001 Yahweh spoke to Moses, after the death of the two sons of Aaron,

        when they drew near before Yahweh, and died;

016:002 and Yahweh said to Moses, "Tell Aaron your brother, not to come

        at all times into the Most Holy Place within the veil,

        before the mercy seat which is on the ark; lest he die:

        for I will appear in the cloud on the mercy seat.

016:003 "Herewith shall Aaron come into the sanctuary:  with a young

        bull for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering.

016:004 He shall put on the holy linen coat, and he shall have the linen

        breeches on his body, and shall put on the linen sash, and he shall

        be dressed with the linen turban.  They are the holy garments.

        He shall bathe his body in water, and put them on.

016:005 He shall take from the congregation of the children of Israel two

        male goats for a sin offering, and one ram for a burnt offering.

016:006 "Aaron shall offer the bull of the sin offering, which is

        for himself, and make atonement for himself and for his house.

016:007 He shall take the two goats, and set them before Yahweh at

        the door of the Tent of Meeting.

016:008 Aaron shall cast lots for the two goats; one lot for Yahweh,

        and the other lot for the scapegoat.

016:009 Aaron shall present the goat on which the lot fell for Yahweh,

        and offer him for a sin offering.

016:010 But the goat, on which the lot fell for the scapegoat, shall be

        presented alive before Yahweh, to make atonement for him,

        to send him away for the scapegoat into the wilderness.

016:011 "Aaron shall present the bull of the sin offering,

        which is for himself, and shall make atonement for himself

        and for his house, and shall kill the bull of the sin offering

        which is for himself.

016:012 He shall take a censer full of coals of fire from off the altar

        before Yahweh, and two handfuls of sweet incense beaten small,

        and bring it within the veil:

016:013 and he shall put the incense on the fire before Yahweh,

        that the cloud of the incense may cover the mercy seat that is

        on the testimony, so that he will not die.

016:014 He shall take some of the blood of the bull, and sprinkle it

        with his finger on the mercy seat on the east; and before

        the mercy seat he shall sprinkle some of the blood with his

        finger seven times.

016:015 "Then he shall kill the goat of the sin offering, that is

        for the people, and bring his blood within the veil,

        and do with his blood as he did with the blood of the bull,

        and sprinkle it on the mercy seat, and before the mercy seat:

016:016 and he shall make atonement for the Holy Place,

        because of the uncleanness of the children of Israel,

        and because of their transgressions, even all their sins;

        and so he shall do for the Tent of Meeting, that dwells

        with them in the midst of their uncleanness.

016:017 There shall be no one in the Tent of Meeting when he enters

        to make atonement in the Holy Place, until he comes out,

        and has made atonement for himself and for his household,

        and for all the assembly of Israel.

016:018 "He shall go out to the altar that is before Yahweh and make

        atonement for it, and shall take some of the bull's blood,

        and some of the goat's blood, and put it on the horns

        of the altar round about.

016:019 He shall sprinkle some of the blood on it with his finger

        seven times, and cleanse it, and make it holy from the uncleanness

        of the children of Israel.

016:020 "When he has made an end of atoning for the Holy Place, the Tent

        of Meeting, and the altar, he shall present the live goat.

016:021 Aaron shall lay both his hands on the head of the live goat,

        and confess over him all the iniquities of the children

        of Israel, and all their transgressions, even all their sins;

        and he shall put them on the head of the goat, and shall

        send him away into the wilderness by the hand of a man

        who is in readiness.

016:022 The goat shall carry all their iniquities on himself to a

        solitary land, and he shall let the goat go in the wilderness.

016:023 "Aaron shall come into the Tent of Meeting, and shall take

        off the linen garments, which he put on when he went into

        the Holy Place, and shall leave them there.

016:024 Then he shall bathe himself in water in a holy place, and put

        on his garments, and come out and offer his burnt offering

        and the burnt offering of the people, and make atonement

        for himself and for the people.

016:025 The fat of the sin offering he shall burn on the altar.

016:026 "He who lets the goat go for the scapegoat shall wash his clothes,

        and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come

        into the camp.

016:027 The bull for the sin offering, and the goat for the sin offering,

        whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the Holy Place,

        shall be carried forth outside the camp; and they shall burn

        their skins, their flesh, and their dung with fire.

016:028 He who burns them shall wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh

        in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp.

016:029 "It shall be a statute to you forever:  in the seventh month,

        on the tenth day of the month, you shall afflict your souls,

        and shall do no manner of work, the native-born, or the stranger

        who lives as a foreigner among you:

016:030 for on this day shall atonement be made for you, to cleanse you;

        from all your sins you shall be clean before Yahweh.

016:031 It is a Sabbath of solemn rest to you, and you shall afflict

        your souls; it is a statute forever.

016:032 The priest, who is anointed and who is consecrated to be

        priest in his father's place, shall make the atonement,

        and shall put on the linen garments, even the holy garments.

016:033 Then he shall make atonement for the Holy Sanctuary; and he shall

        make atonement for the Tent of Meeting and for the altar;

        and he shall make atonement for the priests and for all

        the people of the assembly.

016:034 "This shall be an everlasting statute for you, to make atonement for

        the children of Israel once in the year because of all their sins."

        It was done as Yahweh commanded Moses.

017:001 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

017:002 "Speak to Aaron, and to his sons, and to all the children of Israel,

        and say to them:  'This is the thing which Yahweh has commanded,

017:003 Whatever man there is of the house of Israel, who kills an ox,

        or lamb, or goat, in the camp, or who kills it outside the camp,

017:004 and hasn't brought it to the door of the Tent of Meeting, to offer

        it as an offering to Yahweh before the tabernacle of Yahweh:

        blood shall be imputed to that man.  He has shed blood;

        and that man shall be cut off from among his people.

017:005 This is to the end that the children of Israel may bring

        their sacrifices, which they sacrifice in the open field,

        that they may bring them to Yahweh, to the door of the Tent

        of Meeting, to the priest, and sacrifice them for sacrifices

        of peace offerings to Yahweh.

017:006 The priest shall sprinkle the blood on the altar of Yahweh at

        the door of the Tent of Meeting, and burn the fat for a sweet

        savor to Yahweh.

017:007 They shall no more sacrifice their sacrifices to the goat idols,

        after which they play the prostitute.  This shall be a statute

        forever to them throughout their generations.'

017:008 "You shall say to them, 'Any man there is of the house of Israel,

        or of the strangers who live as foreigners among them,

        who offers a burnt offering or sacrifice,

017:009 and doesn't bring it to the door of the Tent of Meeting,

        to sacrifice it to Yahweh; that man shall be cut off

        from his people.

017:010 "'Any man of the house of Israel, or of the strangers who live

        as foreigners among them, who eats any kind of blood,

        I will set my face against that soul who eats blood,

        and will cut him off from among his people.

017:011 For the life of the flesh is in the blood; and I have given

        it to you on the altar to make atonement for your souls:

        for it is the blood that makes atonement by reason of the life.

017:012 Therefore I have said to the children of Israel, "No person

        among you shall eat blood, neither shall any stranger who lives

        as a foreigner among you eat blood."

017:013 "'Whatever man there is of the children of Israel,

        or of the strangers who live as foreigners among them,

        who takes in hunting any animal or bird that may be eaten;

        he shall pour out its blood, and cover it with dust.

017:014 For as to the life of all flesh, its blood is with its life:

        therefore I said to the children of Israel, "You shall not eat

        the blood of any kind of flesh; for the life of all flesh

        is its blood.  Whoever eats it shall be cut off."

017:015 "'Every person that eats what dies of itself, or that which is

        torn by animals, whether he is native-born or a foreigner,

        he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water,

        and be unclean until the evening:  then he shall be clean.

017:016 But if he doesn't wash them, or bathe his flesh, then he shall

        bear his iniquity.'"

018:001 Yahweh said to Moses,

018:002 "Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, 'I am

        Yahweh your God.

018:003 You shall not do as they do in the land of Egypt, where you lived:

        and you shall not do as they do in the land of Canaan, where I

        am bringing you; neither shall you walk in their statutes.

018:004 You shall do my ordinances, and you shall keep my statutes,

        and walk in them:  I am Yahweh your God.

018:005 You shall therefore keep my statutes and my ordinances;

        which if a man does, he shall live in them:  I am Yahweh.

018:006 "'None of you shall approach anyone who are his close relatives,

        to uncover their nakedness:  I am Yahweh.

018:007 "'You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father,

        nor the nakedness of your mother:  she is your mother.

        You shall not uncover her nakedness.

018:008 "'You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father's wife:

        it is your father's nakedness.

018:009 "'You shall not uncover the nakedness of your sister,

        the daughter of your father, or the daughter of your mother,

        whether born at home, or born abroad.

018:010 "'You shall not uncover the nakedness of your son's daughter,

        or of your daughter's daughter, even their nakedness:

        for theirs is your own nakedness.

018:011 "'You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father's

        wife's daughter, conceived by your father, since she

        is your sister.

018:012 "'You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father's sister:

        she is your father's near kinswoman.

018:013 "'You shall not uncover the nakedness of your mother's sister:

        for she is your mother's near kinswoman.

018:014 "'You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father's brother,

        you shall not approach his wife:  she is your aunt.

018:015 "'You shall not uncover the nakedness of your daughter-in-law:

        it is your brother's nakedness.

018:017 "'You shall not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter.

        You shall not take her son's daughter, or her daughter's daughter,

        to uncover her nakedness; they are near kinswomen:

        it is wickedness.

018:018 "'You shall not take a wife to her sister, to be a rival,

        to uncover her nakedness, while her sister is yet alive.

018:019 "'You shall not approach a woman to uncover her nakedness,

        as long as she is impure by her uncleanness.

018:020 "'You shall not lie carnally with your neighbor's wife,

        and defile yourself with her.

018:021 "'You shall not give any of your children to sacrifice to Molech;

        neither shall you profane the name of your God:  I am Yahweh.

018:022 "'You shall not lie with a man, as with a woman.

        That is detestable.

018:023 "'You shall not lie with any animal to defile yourself with it;

        neither shall any woman give herself to an animal, to lie

        down with it:  it is a perversion.

018:024 "'Don't defile yourselves in any of these things:

        for in all these the nations which I am casting out before

        you were defiled.

018:025 The land was defiled:  therefore I punished its iniquity,

        and the land vomited out her inhabitants.

018:026 You therefore shall keep my statutes and my ordinances, and shall

        not do any of these abominations; neither the native-born,

        nor the stranger who lives as a foreigner among you;

018:027 (for all these abominations have the men of the land done,

        that were before you, and the land became defiled);

018:028 that the land not vomit you out also, when you defile it,

        as it vomited out the nation that was before you.

018:029 "'For whoever shall do any of these abominations, even the souls

        that do them shall be cut off from among their people.

018:030 Therefore you shall keep my charge, that you do not practice

        any of these abominable customs, which were practiced

        before you, and that you do not defile yourselves with them:

        I am Yahweh your God.'"

019:001 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

019:002 "Speak to all the congregation of the children of Israel,

        and tell them, 'You shall be holy; for I Yahweh your God am holy.

019:003 "'Each one of you shall respect his mother and his father.

019:005 "'When you offer a sacrifice of peace offerings to Yahweh,

        you shall offer it so that you may be accepted.

        and if anything remains until the third day, it shall be

        burned with fire.

019:007 If it is eaten at all on the third day, it is an abomination.

        It will not be accepted;

019:008 but everyone who eats it shall bear his iniquity, because he has

        profaned the holy thing of Yahweh, and that soul shall be cut

        off from his people.

019:009 "'When you reap the harvest of your land, you shall not wholly

        reap the corners of your field, neither shall you gather

        the gleanings of your harvest.

019:021 He shall bring his trespass offering to Yahweh, to the door

        of the Tent of Meeting, even a ram for a trespass offering.

019:022 The priest shall make atonement for him with the ram of the trespass

        offering before Yahweh for his sin which he has committed:

019:024 But in the fourth year all its fruit shall be holy, for giving

        praise to Yahweh.

        its increase to you.  I am Yahweh your God.

020:001 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

020:002 "Moreover, you shall tell the children of Israel, 'Anyone of

        the children of Israel, or of the strangers who live as

        foreigners in Israel, who gives any of his seed to Molech;

        he shall surely be put to death.  The people of the land

        shall stone him with stones.

020:003 I also will set my face against that person, and will cut him off

        from among his people because he has given of his seed to Molech,

        to defile my sanctuary, and to profane my holy name.

020:004 If the people of the land all hide their eyes from that person,

        when he gives of his seed to Molech, and don't put him to death;

020:005 then I will set my face against that man, and against his family,

        and will cut him off, and all who play the prostitute after him,

020:006 "'The person that turns to those who are mediums,

020:010 "'The man who commits adultery with another man's wife,

        even he who commits adultery with his neighbor's wife,

        the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death.

020:011 The man who lies with his father's wife has uncovered his

        father's nakedness:  both of them shall surely be put to death;

        casting out before you:  for they did all these things,

        and therefore I abhorred them.

020:024 But I have said to you, "You shall inherit their land, and I will

        give it to you to possess it, a land flowing with milk and honey."

        I am Yahweh your God, who has separated you from the peoples.

020:025 "'You shall therefore make a distinction between the clean animal

        and the unclean, and between the unclean fowl and the clean:

        or by bird, or by anything with which the ground teems,

        which I have separated from you as unclean for you.

020:026 You shall be holy to me:  for I, Yahweh, am holy, and have set

020:027 "'A man or a woman that is a medium, or is a wizard,

        shall surely be put to death:  they shall stone them with stones;

        their blood shall be upon them.'"

021:001 Yahweh said to Moses, "Speak to the priests, the sons of Aaron,

        and say to them, 'A priest shall not defile himself for the dead

        among his people;

021:002 except for his relatives that are near to him:  for his mother,

        for his father, for his son, for his daughter, for his brother,

021:003 and for his virgin sister who is near to him, who has had no husband;

        for her he may defile himself.

021:004 He shall not defile himself, being a chief man among his people,

        to profane himself.

021:005 "'They shall not shave their heads, neither shall they shave

        off the corners of their beards, nor make any cuttings

        in their flesh.

021:006 They shall be holy to their God, and not profane the name of

        their God; for they offer the offerings of Yahweh made by fire,

        the bread of their God; therefore they shall be holy.

021:007 "'They shall not marry a woman who is a prostitute, or profane;

        neither shall they marry a woman divorced from her husband:

        for he is holy to his God.

021:008 You shall sanctify him therefore; for he offers the bread

        of your God:  he shall be holy to you:  for I Yahweh,

        who sanctify you, am holy.

021:009 "'The daughter of any priest, if she profanes herself

        by playing the prostitute, she profanes her father:

        she shall be burned with fire.

021:010 "'He who is the high priest among his brothers, upon whose head

        the anointing oil is poured, and that is consecrated to put

        on the garments, shall not let the hair of his head hang loose,

        nor tear his clothes;

021:011 neither shall he go in to any dead body, nor defile himself

        for his father, or for his mother;

021:012 neither shall he go out of the sanctuary, nor profane

        the sanctuary of his God; for the crown of the anointing oil

        of his God is upon him.  I am Yahweh.

021:013 "'He shall take a wife in her virginity.

021:014 A widow, or one divorced, or a woman who has been defiled,

        or a prostitute, these he shall not marry:  but a virgin

        of his own people shall he take as a wife.

021:015 He shall not profane his seed among his people:

        for I am Yahweh who sanctifies him.'"

021:016 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

021:017 "Say to Aaron, 'None of your seed throughout their generations

        who has a blemish, may approach to offer the bread of his God.

021:018 For whatever man he is that has a blemish, he shall not draw near:

        a blind man, or a lame, or he who has a flat nose,

        or any deformity,

021:019 or a man who has an injured foot, or an injured hand,

021:020 or hunchbacked, or a dwarf, or one who has a defect in his eye,

        or an itching disease, or scabs, or who has damaged testicles;

021:021 no man of the seed of Aaron the priest, who has a blemish,

        shall come near to offer the offerings of Yahweh made by fire.

        Since has a blemish, he shall not come near to offer the bread

        of his God.

021:022 He shall eat the bread of his God, both of the most holy,

        and of the holy.

021:023 He shall not come near to the veil, nor come near to the altar,

        because he has a blemish; that he may not profane my sanctuaries,

        for I am Yahweh who sanctifies them.'"

021:024 So Moses spoke to Aaron, and to his sons, and to all the

        children of Israel.

022:001 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

022:002 "Tell Aaron and his sons to separate themselves from the holy

        things of the children of Israel, which they make holy to me,

        and that they not profane my holy name.  I am Yahweh.

022:003 "Tell them, 'If anyone of all your seed throughout your

        generations approaches the holy things, which the children

        of Israel make holy to Yahweh, having his uncleanness

        on him, that soul shall be cut off from before me.

        I am Yahweh.

022:004 "'Whoever of the seed of Aaron is a leper or has an issue;

        he shall not eat of the holy things, until he is clean.

        Whoever touches anything that is unclean by the dead,

        or a man whose seed goes from him;

022:005 or whoever touches any creeping thing, whereby he may be

        made unclean, or a man of whom he may take uncleanness,

        whatever uncleanness he has;

022:006 the person that touches any such shall be unclean until the evening,

        and shall not eat of the holy things, unless he bathe his

        body in water.

022:007 When the sun is down, he shall be clean; and afterward he shall

        eat of the holy things, because it is his bread.

022:008 That which dies of itself, or is torn by animals, he shall

        not eat, defiling himself by it.  I am Yahweh.

022:009 "'They shall therefore keep my charge, lest they bear

        sin for it, and die therein, if they profane it.

        I am Yahweh who sanctifies them.

022:010 "'No stranger shall eat of the holy thing:  a foreigner

        living with the priests, or a hired servant, shall not eat

        of the holy thing.

022:011 But if a priest buys a slave, purchased by his money,

        he shall eat of it; and such as are born in his house,

        they shall eat of his bread.

022:012 If a priest's daughter is married to an outsider, she shall

        not eat of the heave offering of the holy things.

022:013 But if a priest's daughter is a widow, or divorced,

        and has no child, and has returned to her father's house,

        as in her youth, she may eat of her father's bread:

        but no stranger shall eat any of it.

022:014 "'If a man eats something holy unwittingly, then he shall add

        the fifth part of its value to it, and shall give the holy

        thing to the priest.

022:015 The priests shall not profane the holy things of the children

        of Israel, which they offer to Yahweh,

022:016 and so cause them to bear the iniquity that brings guilt,

        when they eat their holy things:  for I am Yahweh

        who sanctifies them.'"

022:017 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

022:018 "Speak to Aaron, and to his sons, and to all the children

        of Israel, and say to them, 'Whoever is of the house of Israel,

        or of the foreigners in Israel, who offers his offering,

        whether it be any of their vows, or any of their freewill offerings,

        which they offer to Yahweh for a burnt offering;

022:019 that you may be accepted, you shall offer a male without blemish,

        of the bulls, of the sheep, or of the goats.

022:020 But whatever has a blemish, that you shall not offer:

        for it shall not be acceptable for you.

022:021 Whoever offers a sacrifice of peace offerings to Yahweh

        to accomplish a vow, or for a freewill offering, of the herd

        or of the flock, it shall be perfect to be accepted;

        there shall be no blemish therein.

022:022 Blind, injured, maimed, having a wart, festering, or having

        a running sore, you shall not offer these to Yahweh, nor make

        an offering by fire of them on the altar to Yahweh.

022:023 Either a bull or a lamb that has any deformity or lacking

        in his parts, that you may offer for a freewill offering;

        but for a vow it shall not be accepted.

022:024 That which has its testicles bruised, crushed, broken, or cut,

        you shall not offer to Yahweh; neither shall you do thus

        in your land.

022:025 Neither from the hand of a foreigner shall you offer the bread

        of your God of any of these; because their corruption is in them.

        There is a blemish in them.  They shall not be accepted for you.'"

022:026 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

022:027 "When a bull, or a sheep, or a goat, is born, then it shall

        remain seven days with its mother; and from the eighth

        day and thenceforth it shall be accepted for the offering

        of an offering made by fire to Yahweh.

022:028 Whether it is a cow or ewe, you shall not kill it and its young

        both in one day.

022:029 "When you sacrifice a sacrifice of thanksgiving to Yahweh,

        you shall sacrifice it so that you may be accepted.

022:030 It shall be eaten on the same day; you shall leave none of it

        until the morning.  I am Yahweh.

022:031 "Therefore you shall keep my commandments, and do them.

        I am Yahweh.

022:032 You shall not profane my holy name, but I will be made holy

        among the children of Israel.  I am Yahweh who makes you holy,

022:033 who brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God.

        I am Yahweh."

023:001 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

023:002 "Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them, 'The set feasts

        of Yahweh, which you shall proclaim to be holy convocations,

        even these are my set feasts.

023:003 "'Six days shall work be done:  but on the seventh day is a Sabbath

        of solemn rest, a holy convocation; you shall do no manner of work.

        It is a Sabbath to Yahweh in all your dwellings.

023:004 "'These are the set feasts of Yahweh, even holy convocations,

        which you shall proclaim in their appointed season.

023:005 In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month

        in the evening, is Yahweh's Passover.

023:006 On the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of unleavened

        bread to Yahweh.  Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread.

023:007 In the first day you shall have a holy convocation.

        You shall do no regular work.

023:008 But you shall offer an offering made by fire to Yahweh

        seven days.  In the seventh day is a holy convocation:

        you shall do no regular work.'"

023:009 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

023:010 "Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them, 'When you

        have come into the land which I give to you, and shall reap

        its the harvest, then you shall bring the sheaf of the first

        fruits of your harvest to the priest:

023:011 and he shall wave the sheaf before Yahweh, to be accepted for you.

        On the next day after the Sabbath the priest shall wave it.

023:012 On the day when you wave the sheaf, you shall offer a male lamb

        without blemish a year old for a burnt offering to Yahweh.

023:013 The meal offering with it shall be two tenth parts of an ephah

        of fine flour mingled with oil, an offering made by fire

        to Yahweh for a sweet savor; and the drink offering with it

        shall be of wine, the fourth part of a hin.

023:014 You shall eat neither bread, nor roasted grain, nor fresh grain,

        until this same day, until you have brought the offering

        of your God.  This is a statute forever throughout your

        generations in all your dwellings.

023:015 "'You shall count from the next day after the Sabbath,

        from the day that you brought the sheaf of the wave offering;

        seven Sabbaths shall be completed:

023:016 even to the next day after the seventh Sabbath you shall number

        fifty days; and you shall offer a new meal offering to Yahweh.

023:017 You shall bring out of your habitations two loaves of bread for a

        wave offering made of two tenth parts of an ephah of fine flour.

        They shall be baked with yeast, for first fruits to Yahweh.

023:018 You shall present with the bread seven lambs without blemish

        a year old, one young bull, and two rams.  They shall

        be a burnt offering to Yahweh, with their meal offering,

        and their drink offerings, even an offering made by fire,

        of a sweet aroma to Yahweh.

023:019 You shall offer one male goat for a sin offering, and two male

        lambs a year old for a sacrifice of peace offerings.

023:020 The priest shall wave them with the bread of the first fruits

        for a wave offering before Yahweh, with the two lambs.

        They shall be holy to Yahweh for the priest.

023:021 You shall make proclamation on the same day:  there shall

        be a holy convocation to you; you shall do no regular work.

        This is a statute forever in all your dwellings

        throughout your generations.

023:022 "'When you reap the harvest of your land, you shall

        not wholly reap into the corners of your field,

        neither shall you gather the gleanings of your harvest:

        you shall leave them for the poor, and for the foreigner.

        I am Yahweh your God.'"

023:023 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

023:024 "Speak to the children of Israel, saying, 'In the seventh month,

        on the first day of the month, shall be a solemn rest to you,

        a memorial of blowing of trumpets, a holy convocation.

023:025 You shall do no regular work; and you shall offer an offering

        made by fire to Yahweh.'"

023:026 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

023:027 "However on the tenth day of this seventh month is the day

        of atonement:  it shall be a holy convocation to you, and you

        shall afflict yourselves; and you shall offer an offering

        made by fire to Yahweh.

023:028 You shall do no manner of work in that same day; for it is a day

        of atonement, to make atonement for you before Yahweh your God.

023:029 For whoever it is who shall not deny himself in that same day;

        shall be cut off from his people.

023:030 Whoever it is who does any manner of work in that same day,

        that person I will destroy from among his people.

023:031 You shall do no manner of work:  it is a statute forever

        throughout your generations in all your dwellings.

023:032 It shall be a Sabbath of solemn rest for you, and you shall

        deny yourselves.  In the ninth day of the month at evening,

        from evening to evening, you shall keep your Sabbath."

023:033 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

023:034 "Speak to the children of Israel, and say, 'On the fifteenth

        day of this seventh month is the feast of tents for seven

        days to Yahweh.

023:035 On the first day shall be a holy convocation:  you shall

        do no regular work.

023:036 Seven days you shall offer an offering made by fire to Yahweh.

        On the eighth day shall be a holy convocation to you;

        and you shall offer an offering made by fire to Yahweh.

        It is a solemn assembly; you shall do no regular work.

023:037 "'These are the appointed feasts of Yahweh, which you shall

        proclaim to be holy convocations, to offer an offering made

        by fire to Yahweh, a burnt offering, and a meal offering,

        a sacrifice, and drink offerings, each on its own day;

023:038 besides the Sabbaths of Yahweh, and besides your gifts,

        and besides all your vows, and besides all your freewill offerings,

        which you give to Yahweh.

023:039 "'So on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when you have

        gathered in the fruits of the land, you shall keep the feast

        of Yahweh seven days:  on the first day shall be a solemn rest,

        and on the eighth day shall be a solemn rest.

023:040 You shall take on the first day the fruit of goodly trees,

        branches of palm trees, and boughs of thick trees,

        and willows of the brook; and you shall rejoice before Yahweh

        your God seven days.

023:041 You shall keep it a feast to Yahweh seven days in the year:

        it is a statute forever throughout your generations;

        you shall keep it in the seventh month.

023:042 You shall dwell in booths seven days.  All who are native-born

        in Israel shall dwell in booths,

023:043 that your generations may know that I made the children of Israel

        to dwell in booths, when I brought them out of the land of Egypt.

        I am Yahweh your God.'"

023:044 Moses declared to the children of Israel the appointed

        feasts of Yahweh.

024:001 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

024:002 "Command the children of Israel, that they bring to you pure olive

        oil beaten for the light, to cause a lamp to burn continually.

024:003 Outside of the veil of the Testimony, in the Tent of Meeting,

        shall Aaron keep it in order from evening to morning

        before Yahweh continually:  it shall be a statute forever

        throughout your generations.

024:004 He shall keep in order the lamps on the pure gold lampstand

        before Yahweh continually.

024:005 "You shall take fine flour, and bake twelve cakes of it:

        two tenth parts of an ephah shall be in one cake.

024:006 You shall set them in two rows, six on a row, on the pure gold

        table before Yahweh.

024:007 You shall put pure frankincense on each row, that it may

        be to the bread for a memorial, even an offering made

        by fire to Yahweh.

024:008 Every Sabbath day he shall set it in order before

        Yahweh continually.  It is on the behalf of the children

        of Israel an everlasting covenant.

024:009 It shall be for Aaron and his sons; and they shall eat it

        in a holy place:  for it is most holy to him of the offerings

        of Yahweh made by fire by a perpetual statute."

024:010 The son of an Israelite woman, whose father was an Egyptian,

        went out among the children of Israel; and the son of the Israelite

        woman and a man of Israel strove together in the camp.

024:011 The son of the Israelite woman blasphemed the Name, and cursed;

        and they brought him to Moses.  His mother's name was Shelomith,

        the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan.

024:012 They put him in custody, until the will of Yahweh should be

        declared to them.

024:013 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

024:014 "Bring out of the camp him who cursed; and let all who heard him lay

        their hands on his head, and let all the congregation stone him.

024:015 You shall speak to the children of Israel, saying, 'Whoever curses

        his God shall bear his sin.

024:016 He who blasphemes the name of Yahweh, he shall surely be put

        to death; all the congregation shall certainly stone him:

        the foreigner as well as the native-born, when he blasphemes

        the Name, shall be put to death.

024:017 "'He who strikes any man mortally shall surely be put to death.

024:018 He who strikes an animal mortally shall make it good,

        life for life.

024:019 If anyone injures his neighbor; as he has done, so shall it

        be done to him:

024:020 fracture for fracture, eye for eye, tooth for tooth;

        as he has injured someone, so shall it be done to him.

024:021 He who kills an animal shall make it good; and he who kills

        a man shall be put to death.

024:022 You shall have one kind of law, for the foreigner as well

        as the native-born: for I am Yahweh your God.'"

024:023 Moses spoke to the children of Israel; and they brought forth him

        who had cursed out of the camp, and stoned him with stones.

        The children of Israel did as Yahweh commanded Moses.

025:001 Yahweh said to Moses in Mount Sinai,

025:002 "Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them, 'When you

        come into the land which I give you, then the land shall keep

        a Sabbath to Yahweh.

025:003 Six years you shall sow your field, and six years you shall

        prune your vineyard, and gather in its fruits;

025:004 but in the seventh year there shall be a Sabbath of solemn

        rest for the land, a Sabbath to Yahweh.  You shall not sow

        your field or prune your vineyard.

025:005 What grows of itself in your harvest you shall not reap,

        and the grapes of your undressed vine you shall not gather.

        It shall be a year of solemn rest for the land.

025:006 The Sabbath of the land shall be for food for you; for yourself,

        for your servant, for your maid, for your hired servant,

        and for your stranger, who lives as a foreigner with you.

025:007 For your livestock also, and for the animals that are in your land,

        shall all the increase of it be for food.

025:008 "'You shall count off seven Sabbaths of years, seven times

        seven years; and there shall be to you the days of seven

        Sabbaths of years, even forty-nine years.

025:009 Then you shall sound the loud trumpet on the tenth day of

        the seventh month.  On the Day of Atonement you shall sound

        the trumpet throughout all your land.

025:010 You shall make the fiftieth year holy, and proclaim liberty

        throughout the land to all its inhabitants.  It shall be a jubilee

        to you; and each of you shall return to his own property,

        and each of you shall return to his family.

025:011 That fiftieth year shall be a jubilee to you.  In it you

        shall not sow, neither reap that which grows of itself,

        nor gather from the undressed vines.

025:012 For it is a jubilee; it shall be holy to you.  You shall eat

        of its increase out of the field.

025:013 "'In this Year of Jubilee each of you shall return to his property.

025:014 "'If you sell anything to your neighbor, or buy from your neighbor,

        you shall not wrong one another.

025:015 According to the number of years after the Jubilee you shall

        buy from your neighbor.  According to the number of years

        of the crops he shall sell to you.

025:016 According to the length of the years you shall increase the price

        of it, and according to the shortness of the years you shall

        diminish the price of it; for he is selling the number

        of the crops to you.

025:017 You shall not wrong one another; but you shall fear your God:

        for I am Yahweh your God.

025:018 "'Therefore you shall do my statutes, and keep my ordinances

        and do them; and you shall dwell in the land in safety.

025:019 The land shall yield its fruit, and you shall eat your fill,

        and dwell therein in safety.

025:020 If you said, "What shall we eat the seventh year?

        Behold, we shall not sow, nor gather in our increase;"

025:021 then I will command my blessing on you in the sixth year,

        and it shall bring forth fruit for the three years.

025:022 You shall sow the eighth year, and eat of the fruits,

        the old store; until the ninth year, until its fruits come in,

        you shall eat the old store.

025:023 "'The land shall not be sold in perpetuity, for the land is mine;

        for you are strangers and live as foreigners with me.

025:024 In all the land of your possession you shall grant a redemption

        for the land.

025:025 "'If your brother becomes poor, and sells some of his possessions,

        then his kinsman who is next to him shall come, and redeem

        that which his brother has sold.

025:026 If a man has no one to redeem it, and he becomes prosperous

        and finds sufficient means to redeem it;

025:027 then let him reckon the years since the sale of it,

        and restore the surplus to the man to whom he sold it;

        and he shall return to his property.

025:028 But if he isn't able to get it back for himself, then what he has

        sold shall remain in the hand of him who has bought it until

        the Year of Jubilee:  and in the Jubilee it shall be released,

        and he shall return to his property.

025:029 "'If a man sells a dwelling house in a walled city, then he may

        redeem it within a whole year after it has been sold.

        For a full year he shall have the right of redemption.

025:030 If it isn't redeemed within the space of a full year,

        then the house that is in the walled city shall be made sure

        in perpetuity to him who bought it, throughout his generations.

        It shall not be released in the Jubilee.

025:031 But the houses of the villages which have no wall round

        about them shall be reckoned with the fields of the country:

        they may be redeemed, and they shall be released in the Jubilee.

025:032 "'Nevertheless the cities of the Levites, the houses in the cities

        of their possession, the Levites may redeem at any time.

025:033 The Levites may redeem the house that was sold, and the city

        of his possession, and it shall be released in the Jubilee;

        for the houses of the cities of the Levites are their possession

        among the children of Israel.

025:034 But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold;

        for it is their perpetual possession.

025:035 "'If your brother has become poor, and his hand can't

        support him among you; then you shall uphold him.

        As a stranger and a sojourner he shall live with you.

025:036 Take no interest from him or profit, but fear your God;

        that your brother may live among you.

025:037 You shall not lend him your money at interest, nor give him

        your food for profit.

025:038 I am Yahweh your God, who brought you forth out of the land

        of Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan, and to be your God.

025:039 "'If your brother has grown poor among you, and sells himself

        to you; you shall not make him to serve as a slave.

025:040 As a hired servant, and as a sojourner, he shall be with you;

        he shall serve with you until the Year of Jubilee:

025:041 then he shall go out from you, he and his children with him,

        and shall return to his own family, and to the possession

        of his fathers.

025:042 For they are my servants, whom I brought forth out of the land

        of Egypt.  They shall not be sold as slaves.

025:043 You shall not rule over him with harshness, but shall

        fear your God.

025:044 "'As for your male and your female slaves, whom you may have;

        of the nations that are around you, from them you may buy

        male and female slaves.

025:045 Moreover of the children of the strangers who sojourn among you,

        of them you may buy, and of their families who are with you,

        which they have conceived in your land; and they will

        be your property.

025:046 You may make them an inheritance for your children after you,

        to hold for a possession; of them may you take your slaves forever:

        but over your brothers the children of Israel you shall not rule,

        one over another, with harshness.

025:047 "'If a stranger or sojourner with you becomes rich,

        and your brother beside him has grown poor, and sells himself

        to the stranger or foreigner living among you, or to a member

        of the stranger's family;

025:048 after he is sold he may be redeemed.  One of his brothers

        may redeem him;

025:049 or his uncle, or his uncle's son, may redeem him, or any

        who is a close relative to him of his family may redeem him;

        or if he has grown rich, he may redeem himself.

025:050 He shall reckon with him who bought him from the year

        that he sold himself to him to the Year of Jubilee:

        and the price of his sale shall be according to the number

        of years; according to the time of a hired servant shall

        he be with him.

025:051 If there are yet many years, according to them he shall

        give back the price of his redemption out of the money

        that he was bought for.

025:052 If there remain but a few years to the year of jubilee,

        then he shall reckon with him; according to his years of service

        he shall give back the price of his redemption.

025:053 As a servant hired year by year shall he be with him:

        he shall not rule with harshness over him in your sight.

025:054 If he isn't redeemed by these means, then he shall be released

        in the Year of Jubilee, he, and his children with him.

025:055 For to me the children of Israel are servants; they are my

        servants whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt.

        I am Yahweh your God.

026:001 "'You shall make for yourselves no idols, neither shall you

        raise up an engraved image or a pillar, neither shall you

        place any figured stone in your land, to bow down to it:

        for I am Yahweh your God.

026:002 "'You shall keep my Sabbaths, and have reverence for my sanctuary.

        I am Yahweh.

026:003 "'If you walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments,

        and do them;

026:004 then I will give you your rains in their season, and the land

        shall yield its increase, and the trees of the field shall

        yield their fruit.

026:005 Your threshing shall reach to the vintage, and the vintage

        shall reach to the sowing time; and you shall eat your bread

        to the full, and dwell in your land safely.

026:006 "'I will give peace in the land, and you shall lie down,

        and no one will make you afraid; and I will remove evil animals

        out of the land, neither shall the sword go through your land.

026:007 You shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before you

        by the sword.

026:008 Five of you shall chase a hundred, and a hundred of you shall

        chase ten thousand; and your enemies shall fall before you

        by the sword.

026:009 "'I will have respect for you, and make you fruitful,

        and multiply you, and will establish my covenant with you.

026:010 You shall eat old store long kept, and you shall move out

        the old because of the new.

026:011 I will set my tent among you:  and my soul won't abhor you.

026:012 I will walk among you, and will be your God, and you will

        be my people.

026:013 I am Yahweh your God, who brought you forth out of the land

        of Egypt, that you should not be their slaves; and I have

        broken the bars of your yoke, and made you go upright.

026:014 "'But if you will not listen to me, and will not do

        all these commandments;

026:015 and if you shall reject my statutes, and if your soul abhors

        my ordinances, so that you will not do all my commandments,

        but break my covenant;

026:016 I also will do this to you:  I will appoint terror over you,

        even consumption and fever, that shall consume the eyes,

        and make the soul to pine away; and you will sow your seed

        in vain, for your enemies will eat it.

026:017 I will set my face against you, and you will be struck

        before your enemies.  Those who hate you will rule over you;

        and you will flee when no one pursues you.

026:018 "'If you in spite of these things will not listen to me,

        then I will chastise you seven times more for your sins.

026:019 I will break the pride of your power, and I will make your sky

        like iron, and your soil like brass;

026:020 and your strength will be spent in vain; for your land won't

        yield its increase, neither will the trees of the land

        yield their fruit.

026:021 "'If you walk contrary to me, and won't listen to me,

        then I will bring seven times more plagues on you according

        to your sins.

026:022 I will send the wild animals among you, which will rob you

        of your children, destroy your livestock, and make you few

        in number; and your roads will become desolate.

026:023 "'If by these things you won't be reformed to me, but will walk

        contrary to me;

026:024 then I will also walk contrary to you; and I will strike you,

        even I, seven times for your sins.

026:025 I will bring a sword upon you, that will execute the vengeance

        of the covenant; and you will be gathered together within

        your cities:  and I will send the pestilence among you;

        and you will be delivered into the hand of the enemy.

026:026 When I break your staff of bread, ten women shall bake your bread

        in one oven, and they shall deliver your bread again by weight:

        and you shall eat, and not be satisfied.

026:027 "'If you in spite of this won't listen to me, but walk

        contrary to me;

026:028 then I will walk contrary to you in wrath; and I also will

        chastise you seven times for your sins.

026:029 You will eat the flesh of your sons, and you will eat the flesh

        of your daughters.

026:030 I will destroy your high places, and cut down your incense altars,

        and cast your dead bodies upon the bodies of your idols;

        and my soul will abhor you.

026:031 I will lay your cities waste, and will bring your sanctuaries

        to desolation, and I will not take delight in the sweet

        fragrance of your offerings.

026:032 I will bring the land into desolation; and your enemies

        that dwell therein will be astonished at it.

026:033 I will scatter you among the nations, and I will draw out

        the sword after you:  and your land will be a desolation,

        and your cities shall be a waste.

026:034 Then the land will enjoy its sabbaths as long as it lies

        desolate and you are in your enemies' land.  Even then the land

        will rest and enjoy its sabbaths.

026:035 As long as it lies desolate it shall have rest, even the rest

        which it didn't have in your sabbaths, when you lived on it.

026:036 "'As for those of you who are left, I will send a faintness

        into their hearts in the lands of their enemies:

        and the sound of a driven leaf will put them to flight;

        and they shall flee, as one flees from the sword; and they

        will fall when no one pursues.

026:037 They will stumble over one another, as it were before the sword,

        when no one pursues:  and you will have no power to stand

        before your enemies.

026:038 You will perish among the nations, and the land of your enemies

        will eat you up.

026:039 Those of you who are left will pine away in their iniquity

        in your enemies' lands; and also in the iniquities of their

        fathers shall they pine away with them.

026:040 "'If they confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers,

        in their trespass which they trespassed against me, and also that,

        because they walked contrary to me,

026:041 I also walked contrary to them, and brought them into the land

        of their enemies:  if then their uncircumcised heart is humbled,

        and they then accept the punishment of their iniquity;

026:042 then I will remember my covenant with Jacob; and also my

        covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham;

        and I will remember the land.

026:043 The land also will be left by them, and will enjoy its sabbaths

        while it lies desolate without them:  and they will accept

        the punishment of their iniquity; because, even because they

        rejected my ordinances, and their soul abhorred my statutes.

026:044 Yet for all that, when they are in the land of their enemies,

        I will not reject them, neither will I abhor them,

        to destroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with them;

        for I am Yahweh their God;

026:045 but I will for their sake remember the covenant of their

        ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt

        in the sight of the nations, that I might be their God.

        I am Yahweh.'"

026:046 These are the statutes, ordinances and laws, which Yahweh made

        between him and the children of Israel in Mount Sinai by Moses.

027:001 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

027:002 "Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, 'When a man

        makes a vow, the persons shall be for Yahweh by your valuation.

027:003 Your valuation shall be of a male from twenty years old even

        to sixty years old, even your valuation shall be fifty shekels

        of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary.

027:004 If it is a female, then your valuation shall be thirty shekels.

027:005 If the person is from five years old even to twenty years old,

        then your valuation shall be for a male twenty shekels,

        and for a female ten shekels.

027:006 If the person is from a month old even to five years old,

        then your valuation shall be for a male five shekels of silver,

        and for a female your valuation shall be three shekels of silver.

027:007 If the person is from sixty years old and upward; if it

        is a male, then your valuation shall be fifteen shekels,

        and for a female ten shekels.

027:008 But if he is poorer than your valuation, then he shall be set

        before the priest, and the priest shall value him; according to

        the ability of him who vowed shall the priest value him.

027:009 "'If it is an animal, of which men offer an offering to Yahweh,

        all that any man gives of such to Yahweh becomes holy.

027:010 He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad

        for a good:  and if he shall at all change animal for animal,

        then both it and that for which it is changed shall be holy.

027:011 If it is any unclean animal, of which they do not offer

        as an offering to Yahweh, then he shall set the animal

        before the priest;

027:012 and the priest shall value it, whether it is good or bad.

        As you the priest values it, so shall it be.

027:013 But if he will indeed redeem it, then he shall add the fifth

        part of it to its valuation.

027:014 "'When a man dedicates his house to be holy to Yahweh,

        then the priest shall evaluate it, whether it is good or bad:

        as the priest shall evaluate it, so shall it stand.

027:015 If he who dedicates it will redeem his house, then he shall

        add the fifth part of the money of your valuation to it,

        and it shall be his.

027:016 "'If a man dedicates to Yahweh part of the field of his possession,

        then your valuation shall be according to the seed for it:

        the sowing of a homer of barley shall be valued at fifty

        shekels of silver.

027:017 If he dedicates his field from the Year of Jubilee,

        according to your valuation it shall stand.

027:018 But if he dedicates his field after the Jubilee, then the priest

        shall reckon to him the money according to the years that

        remain to the Year of Jubilee; and an abatement shall be made

        from your valuation.

027:019 If he who dedicated the field will indeed redeem it, then he shall

        add the fifth part of the money of your valuation to it,

        and it shall remain his.

027:020 If he will not redeem the field, or if he has sold the field

        to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more;

027:021 but the field, when it goes out in the Jubilee, shall be holy

        to Yahweh, as a field devoted; it shall be owned by the priests.

027:022 "'If he dedicates to Yahweh a field which he has bought,

        which is not of the field of his possession,

027:023 then the priest shall reckon to him the worth of your valuation

        up to the Year of Jubilee; and he shall give your valuation

        on that day, as a holy thing to Yahweh.

027:024 In the Year of Jubilee the field shall return to him from

        whom it was bought, even to him to whom the possession

        of the land belongs.

027:025 All your valuations shall be according to the shekel of

        the sanctuary:  twenty gerahs to the shekel.

027:026 "'Only the firstborn among animals, which is made a firstborn

        to Yahweh, no man may dedicate it; whether an ox or sheep,

        it is Yahweh's.

027:027 If it is an unclean animal, then he shall buy it back according

        to your valuation, and shall add to it the fifth part of it:

        or if it isn't redeemed, then it shall be sold according

        to your valuation.

027:028 "'Notwithstanding, no devoted thing, that a man shall devote

        to Yahweh of all that he has, whether of man or animal,

        or of the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed:

        every devoted thing is most holy to Yahweh.

027:029 "'No one devoted, who shall be devoted from among men,

        shall be ransomed; he shall surely be put to death.

027:030 "'All the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land

        or of the fruit of the trees, is Yahweh's. It is holy to Yahweh.

027:031 If a man redeems anything of his tithe, he shall add a fifth

        part to it.

027:032 All the tithe of the herds or the flocks, whatever passes

        under the rod, the tenth shall be holy to Yahweh.

027:033 He shall not search whether it is good or bad,

        neither shall he change it:  and if he changes it at all,

        then both it and that for which it is changed shall be holy.

        It shall not be redeemed.'"

027:034 These are the commandments which Yahweh commanded Moses

        for the children of Israel on Mount Sinai.

Book 04 Numbers

001:001 Yahweh spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the Tent

        of Meeting, on the first day of the second month, in the second

        year after they had come out of the land of Egypt, saying,

001:002 "Take a census of all the congregation of the children of Israel,

        by their families, by their fathers' houses, according to

        the number of the names, every male, one by one;

001:003 from twenty years old and upward, all who are able to go

        out to war in Israel.  You and Aaron shall number them

        by their divisions.

001:004 With you there shall be a man of every tribe; everyone head

        of his fathers' house.

001:005 These are the names of the men who shall stand with you:

        Of Reuben:  Elizur the son of Shedeur.

001:006 Of Simeon:  Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai.

001:007 Of Judah:  Nahshon the son of Amminadab.

001:008 Of Issachar:  Nethanel the son of Zuar.

001:009 Of Zebulun:  Eliab the son of Helon.

001:010 Of the children of Joseph:  Of Ephraim:  Elishama the son of Ammihud.

        Of Manasseh:  Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur.

001:011 Of Benjamin:  Abidan the son of Gideoni.

001:012 Of Dan:  Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai.

001:013 Of Asher:  Pagiel the son of Ochran.

001:014 Of Gad:  Eliasaph the son of Deuel.

001:015 Of Naphtali:  Ahira the son of Enan."

001:016 These are those who were called of the congregation,

        the princes of the tribes of their fathers; they were the heads

        of the thousands of Israel.

001:017 Moses and Aaron took these men who are mentioned by name.

001:018 They assembled all the congregation together on the first

        day of the second month; and they declared their ancestry

        by their families, by their fathers' houses, according to

        the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward,

        one by one.

001:019 As Yahweh commanded Moses, so he numbered them in the

        wilderness of Sinai.

001:020 The children of Reuben, Israel's firstborn, their generations,

        by their families, by their fathers' houses, according to

        the number of the names, one by one, every male from twenty

        years old and upward, all who were able to go out to war;

001:021 those who were numbered of them, of the tribe of Reuben,

        were forty-six thousand five hundred.

001:022 Of the children of Simeon, their generations, by their families,

        by their fathers' houses, those who were numbered of it,

        according to the number of the names, one by one, every male

        from twenty years old and upward, all who were able to go

        out to war;

001:023 those who were numbered of them, of the tribe of Simeon,

        were fifty-nine thousand three hundred.

001:024 Of the children of Gad, their generations, by their families,

        by their fathers' houses, according to the number of the names,

        from twenty years old and upward, all who were able to go

        out to war;

001:025 those who were numbered of them, of the tribe of Gad,

        were forty-five thousand six hundred fifty.

001:026 Of the children of Judah, their generations, by their families,

        by their fathers' houses, according to the number of the names,

        from twenty years old and upward, all who were able to go

        out to war;

001:027 those who were numbered of them, of the tribe of Judah,

        were sixty-four thousand six hundred.

001:028 Of the children of Issachar, their generations, by their families,

        by their fathers' houses, according to the number of the names,

        from twenty years old and upward, all who were able to go

        out to war;

001:029 those who were numbered of them, of the tribe of Issachar,

        were fifty-four thousand four hundred.

001:030 Of the children of Zebulun, their generations, by their families,

        by their fathers' houses, according to the number of the names,

        from twenty years old and upward, all who were able to go

        out to war;

001:031 those who were numbered of them, of the tribe of Zebulun,

        were fifty-seven thousand four hundred.

001:032 Of the children of Joseph, of the children of Ephraim,

        their generations, by their families, by their fathers'

        houses, according to the number of the names, from twenty

        years old and upward, all who were able to go out to war;

001:033 those who were numbered of them, of the tribe of Ephraim,

        were forty thousand five hundred.

001:034 Of the children of Manasseh, their generations, by their families,

        by their fathers' houses, according to the number of the names,

        from twenty years old and upward, all who were able to go

        out to war;

001:035 those who were numbered of them, of the tribe of Manasseh,

        were thirty-two thousand two hundred.

001:036 Of the children of Benjamin, their generations, by their families,

        by their fathers' houses, according to the number of the names,

        from twenty years old and upward, all who were able to go

        out to war;

001:037 those who were numbered of them, of the tribe of Benjamin,

        were thirty-five thousand four hundred.

001:038 Of the children of Dan, their generations, by their families,

        by their fathers' houses, according to the number of the names,

        from twenty years old and upward, all who were able to go

        forth to war;

001:039 those who were numbered of them, of the tribe of Dan,

        were sixty-two thousand seven hundred.

001:040 Of the children of Asher, their generations, by their families,

        by their fathers' houses, according to the number of the names,

        from twenty years old and upward, all who were able to go

        forth to war;

001:041 those who were numbered of them, of the tribe of Asher,

        were forty-one thousand five hundred.

001:042 Of the children of Naphtali, their generations, by their families,

        by their fathers' houses, according to the number of the names,

        from twenty years old and upward, all who were able to go

        forth to war;

001:043 those who were numbered of them, of the tribe of Naphtali,

        were fifty-three thousand four hundred.

001:044 These are those who were numbered, whom Moses and Aaron

        numbered, and the princes of Israel, being twelve men:

        they were each one for his fathers' house.

001:045 So all those who were numbered of the children of Israel

        by their fathers' houses, from twenty years old and upward,

        all who were able to go out to war in Israel;

001:046 even all those who were numbered were six hundred three thousand

        five hundred fifty.

001:047 But the Levites after the tribe of their fathers were not

        numbered among them.

001:048 For Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

001:049 "Only the tribe of Levi you shall not number, neither shall

        you take a census of them among the children of Israel;

001:050 but appoint the Levites over the Tabernacle of the Testimony,

        and over all its furnishings, and over all that belongs to it.

        They shall carry the tabernacle, and all its furnishings;

        and they shall take care of it, and shall encamp around it.

001:051 When the tabernacle is to move, the Levites shall take it down;

        and when the tabernacle is to be set up, the Levites shall set

        it up.  The stranger who comes near shall be put to death.

001:052 The children of Israel shall pitch their tents, every man

        by his own camp, and every man by his own standard,

        according to their divisions.

001:053 But the Levites shall encamp around the Tabernacle of the Testimony,

        that there may be no wrath on the congregation of the children

        of Israel:  and the Levites shall be responsible for the Tabernacle

        of the Testimony."

001:054 Thus the children of Israel did.  According to all that Yahweh

        commanded Moses, so they did.

002:001 Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,

002:002 "The children of Israel shall encamp every man by his own standard,

        with the banners of their fathers' houses:  at a distance

        from the tent of meeting shall they encamp around it."

002:003 Those who encamp on the east side toward the sunrise shall be of

        the standard of the camp of Judah, according to their divisions:

        and the prince of the children of Judah shall be Nahshon

        the son of Amminadab.

002:004 His division, and those who were numbered of them,

        were seventy-four thousand six hundred.

002:005 Those who encamp next to him shall be the tribe of Issachar:

        and the prince of the children of Issachar shall be Nethanel

        the son of Zuar.

002:006 His division, and those who were numbered of it, were fifty-four

        thousand four hundred.

002:007 The tribe of Zebulun:  and the prince of the children of Zebulun

        shall be Eliab the son of Helon.

002:008 His division, and those who were numbered of it, were fifty-seven

        thousand four hundred.

002:009 All who were numbered of the camp of Judah were one hundred

        eighty-six thousand four hundred, according to their divisions.

        They shall set out first.

002:010 "On the south side shall be the standard of the camp of Reuben

        according to their divisions.  The prince of the children

        of Reuben shall be Elizur the son of Shedeur.

002:011 His division, and those who were numbered of it, were forty-six

        thousand five hundred.

002:012 "Those who encamp next to him shall be the tribe of Simeon.

        The prince of the children of Simeon shall be Shelumiel

        the son of Zurishaddai.

002:013 His division, and those who were numbered of them, were fifty-nine

        thousand three hundred.

002:014 "The tribe of Gad:  and the prince of the children of Gad

        shall be Eliasaph the son of Reuel.

002:015 His division, and those who were numbered of them, were forty-five

        thousand six hundred fifty.

002:016 "All who were numbered of the camp of Reuben were one hundred

        fifty-one thousand four hundred fifty, according to their armies.

        They shall set out second.

002:017 "Then the tent of meeting shall set out, with the camp

        of the Levites in the midst of the camps.  As they encamp,

        so shall they set out, every man in his place, by their standards.

002:018 "On the west side shall be the standard of the camp of Ephraim

        according to their divisions:  and the prince of the children

        of Ephraim shall be Elishama the son of Ammihud.

002:019 His division, and those who were numbered of them, were forty

        thousand five hundred.

002:020 "Next to him shall be the tribe of Manasseh:  and the prince

        of the children of Manasseh shall be Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur.

002:021 His division, and those who were numbered of them, were thirty-two

        thousand two hundred.

002:022 "The tribe of Benjamin:  and the prince of the children

        of Benjamin shall be Abidan the son of Gideoni.

002:023 His army, and those who were numbered of them, were thirty-five

        thousand four hundred.

002:024 "All who were numbered of the camp of Ephraim were one hundred

        eight thousand one hundred, according to their divisions.

        They shall set out third.

002:025 "On the north side shall be the standard of the camp of Dan

        according to their divisions:  and the prince of the children

        of Dan shall be Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai.

002:026 His division, and those who were numbered of them, were sixty-two

        thousand seven hundred.

002:027 "Those who encamp next to him shall be the tribe of Asher:

        and the prince of the children of Asher shall be Pagiel

        the son of Ochran.

002:028 His division, and those who were numbered of them, were forty-one

        thousand and five hundred.

002:029 "The tribe of Naphtali:  and the prince of the children

        of Naphtali shall be Ahira the son of Enan.

002:030 His division, and those who were numbered of them, were fifty-three

        thousand four hundred.

002:031 "All who were numbered of the camp of Dan were one hundred

        fifty-seven thousand six hundred.  They shall set out last

        by their standards."

002:032 These are those who were numbered of the children of Israel

        by their fathers' houses.  All who were numbered of the camps

        according to their armies were six hundred three thousand

        five hundred fifty.

002:033 But the Levites were not numbered among the children of Israel;

        as Yahweh commanded Moses.

002:034 Thus the children of Israel did.  According to all that Yahweh

        commanded Moses, so they encamped by their standards,

        and so they set out, everyone by their families, according to

        their fathers' houses.

003:001 Now this is the history of the generations of Aaron and Moses

        in the day that Yahweh spoke with Moses in Mount Sinai.

003:002 These are the names of the sons of Aaron:  Nadab the firstborn,

        and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.

003:003 These are the names of the sons of Aaron, the priests

        who were anointed, whom he consecrated to minister in

        the priest's office.

003:004 Nadab and Abihu died before Yahweh, when they offered strange

        fire before Yahweh, in the wilderness of Sinai, and they had

        no children.  Eleazar and Ithamar ministered in the priest's

        office in the presence of Aaron their father.

003:005 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

003:006 "Bring the tribe of Levi near, and set them before Aaron

        the priest, that they may minister to him.

003:007 They shall keep his charge, and the charge of the whole

        congregation before the Tent of Meeting, to do the service

        of the tabernacle.

003:008 They shall keep all the furnishings of the Tent of Meeting,

        and the obligations of the children of Israel, to do the service

        of the tabernacle.

003:009 You shall give the Levites to Aaron and to his sons.  They are

        wholly given to him on the behalf of the children of Israel.

003:010 You shall appoint Aaron and his sons, and they shall keep

        their priesthood.  The stranger who comes near shall be

        put to death."

003:011 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

003:012 "Behold, I have taken the Levites from among the children

        of Israel instead of all the firstborn who open the womb among

        the children of Israel; and the Levites shall be mine:

003:013 for all the firstborn are mine.  On the day that I struck

        down all the firstborn in the land of Egypt I made holy

        to me all the firstborn in Israel, both man and animal.

        They shall be mine.  I am Yahweh."

003:014 Yahweh spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, saying,

003:015 "Number the children of Levi by their fathers' houses,

        by their families:  every male from a month old and upward

        shall you number."

003:016 Moses numbered them according to the word of Yahweh,

        as he was commanded.

003:017 These were the sons of Levi by their names:  Gershon, and Kohath,

        and Merari.

003:018 These are the names of the sons of Gershon by their families:

        Libni and Shimei.

003:019 The sons of Kohath by their families:  Amram, and Izhar, Hebron,

        and Uzziel.

003:020 The sons of Merari by their families:  Mahli and Mushi.

        These are the families of the Levites according to

        their fathers' houses.

003:021 Of Gershon was the family of the Libnites, and the family

        of the Shimeites:  these are the families of the Gershonites.

003:022 Those who were numbered of them, according to the number of all

        the males, from a month old and upward, even those who were

        numbered of them were seven thousand five hundred.

003:023 The families of the Gershonites shall encamp behind

        the tabernacle westward.

003:024 The prince of the fathers' house of the Gershonites shall

        be Eliasaph the son of Lael.

003:025 The charge of the sons of Gershon in the Tent of Meeting shall

        be the tabernacle, and the tent, its covering, and the screen

        for the door of the Tent of Meeting,

003:026 and the hangings of the court, and the screen for the door

        of the court, which is by the tabernacle, and around the altar,

        and its cords for all of its service.

003:027 Of Kohath was the family of the Amramites, and the family

        of the Izharites, and the family of the Hebronites,

        and the family of the Uzzielites:  these are the families

        of the Kohathites.

003:028 According to the number of all the males, from a month

        old and upward, there were eight thousand six hundred,

        keeping the charge of the sanctuary.

003:029 The families of the sons of Kohath shall encamp on the south

        side of the tabernacle.

003:030 The prince of the fathers' house of the families of the Kohathites

        shall be Elizaphan the son of Uzziel.

003:031 Their charge shall be the ark, the table, the lamp stand,

        the altars, the vessels of the sanctuary with which they minister,

        and the screen, and all its service.

003:032 Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest shall be prince of the princes

        of the Levites, with the oversight of those who keep the charge

        of the sanctuary.

003:033 Of Merari was the family of the Mahlites, and the family

        of the Mushites.  These are the families of Merari.

003:034 Those who were numbered of them, according to the number

        of all the males, from a month old and upward, were six

        thousand two hundred.

003:035 The prince of the fathers' house of the families of Merari

        was Zuriel the son of Abihail.  They shall encamp on the north

        side of the tabernacle.

003:036 The appointed charge of the sons of Merari shall be the

        tabernacle's boards, its bars, its pillars, its sockets,

        all its instruments, all its service,

003:037 the pillars of the court around it, their sockets, their pins,

        and their cords.

003:038 Those who encamp before the tabernacle eastward,

        in front of the Tent of Meeting toward the sunrise,

        shall be Moses, and Aaron and his sons, keeping the charge

        of the sanctuary for the charge of the children of Israel.

        The stranger who comes near shall be put to death.

003:039 All who were numbered of the Levites, whom Moses and Aaron numbered

        at the commandment of Yahweh, by their families, all the males

        from a month old and upward, were twenty-two thousand.

003:040 Yahweh said to Moses, "Number all the firstborn males

        of the children of Israel from a month old and upward,

        and take the number of their names.

003:041 You shall take the Levites for me (I am Yahweh)

        instead of all the firstborn among the children of Israel;

        and the livestock of the Levites instead of all the firstborn

        among the livestock of the children of Israel."

003:042 Moses numbered, as Yahweh commanded him, all the firstborn

        among the children of Israel.

003:043 All the firstborn males according to the number of names,

        from a month old and upward, of those who were numbered of them,

        were twenty-two thousand two hundred seventy-three.

003:044 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

003:045 "Take the Levites instead of all the firstborn among

        the children of Israel, and the livestock of the Levites

        instead of their livestock; and the Levites shall be mine.

        I am Yahweh.

003:046 For the redemption of the two hundred seventy-three of the

        firstborn of the children of Israel, who exceed the number

        of the Levites,

003:047 you shall take five shekels apiece for each one;

        after the shekel of the sanctuary you shall take them

        (the shekel is twenty gerahs):

003:048 and you shall give the money, with which the remainder of them

        is redeemed, to Aaron and to his sons."

003:049 Moses took the redemption money from those who exceeded

        the number of those who were redeemed by the Levites;

003:050 from the firstborn of the children of Israel he took the money,

        one thousand three hundred sixty-five shekels, after the shekel

        of the sanctuary:

003:051 and Moses gave the redemption money to Aaron and to his sons,

        according to the word of Yahweh, as Yahweh commanded Moses.

004:001 Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,

004:002 "Take a census of the sons of Kohath from among the sons of Levi,

        by their families, by their fathers' houses,

004:003 from thirty years old and upward even until fifty years old,

        all who enter into the service, to do the work in the

        Tent of Meeting.

004:004 This is the service of the sons of Kohath in the Tent of Meeting,

        the most holy things.

004:005 When the camp moves forward, Aaron shall go in, and his sons,

        and they shall take down the veil of the screen, and cover

        the ark of the Testimony with it,

004:006 and shall put a covering of sealskin on it, and shall spread

        over it a cloth all of blue, and shall put in its poles.

004:007 On the table of show bread they shall spread a blue cloth,

        and put on it the dishes, the spoons, the bowls, and the cups

        with which to pour out; and the continual bread shall be on it.

004:008 They shall spread on them a scarlet cloth, and cover the same

        with a covering of sealskin, and shall put in its poles.

004:009 They shall take a blue cloth, and cover the lampstand of the light,

        and its lamps, and its snuffers, and its snuff dishes,

        and all its oil vessels, with which they minister to it.

004:010 They shall put it and all its vessels within a covering of sealskin,

        and shall put it on the frame.

004:011 On the golden altar they shall spread a blue cloth, and cover

        it with a covering of sealskin, and shall put in its poles.

004:012 They shall take all the vessels of ministry, with which they

        minister in the sanctuary, and put them in a blue cloth,

        and cover them with a covering of sealskin, and shall put

        them on the frame.

004:013 They shall take away the ashes from the altar, and spread

        a purple cloth on it.

004:014 They shall put on it all its vessels, with which they minister

        about it, the fire pans, the flesh hooks, the shovels,

        and the basins; all the vessels of the altar; and they shall

        spread on it a covering of sealskin, and put in its poles.

004:015 "When Aaron and his sons have finished covering the sanctuary,

        and all the furniture of the sanctuary, as the camp moves forward;

        after that, the sons of Kohath shall come to carry it:

        but they shall not touch the sanctuary, lest they die.

        These things are the burden of the sons of Kohath in the

        Tent of Meeting.

004:016 "The charge of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest shall be the oil

        for the light, the sweet incense, the continual meal offering,

        and the anointing oil, the charge of all the tabernacle,

        and of all that is in it, the sanctuary, and its furnishings."

004:017 Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,

004:018 "Don't cut off the tribe of the families of the Kohathites

        from among the Levites;

004:019 but thus do to them, that they may live, and not die, when they

        approach to the most holy things:  Aaron and his sons shall go in,

        and appoint them everyone to his service and to his burden;

004:020 but they shall not go in to see the sanctuary even for a moment,

        lest they die."

004:021 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

004:022 "Take a census of the sons of Gershon also, by their fathers'

        houses, by their families;

004:023 from thirty years old and upward until fifty years old shall

        you number them; all who enter in to wait on the service,

        to do the work in the Tent of Meeting.

004:024 This is the service of the families of the Gershonites,

        in serving and in bearing burdens:

004:025 they shall carry the curtains of the tabernacle, and the Tent

        of Meeting, its covering, and the covering of sealskin that is

        above on it, and the screen for the door of the Tent of Meeting,

004:026 and the hangings of the court, and the screen for the door

        of the gate of the court, which is by the tabernacle and

        around the altar, and their cords, and all the instruments

        of their service, and whatever shall be done with them.

        Therein shall they serve.

004:027 At the commandment of Aaron and his sons shall be all the

        service of the sons of the Gershonites, in all their burden,

        and in all their service; and you shall appoint to them

        in charge all their burden.

004:028 This is the service of the families of the sons of the Gershonites

        in the Tent of Meeting:  and their charge shall be under

        the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.

004:029 "As for the sons of Merari, you shall number them by their families,

        by their fathers' houses;

004:030 from thirty years old and upward even to fifty years old

        shall you number them, everyone who enters on the service,

        to do the work of the Tent of Meeting.

004:031 This is the charge of their burden, according to all their

        service in the Tent of Meeting:  the tabernacle's boards,

        its bars, its pillars, its sockets,

004:032 and the pillars of the court around it, and their sockets,

        and their pins, and their cords, with all their instruments,

        and with all their service:  and by name you shall appoint

        the instruments of the charge of their burden.

004:033 This is the service of the families of the sons of Merari,

        according to all their service, in the Tent of Meeting,

        under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest."

004:034 Moses and Aaron and the princes of the congregation

        numbered the sons of the Kohathites by their families,

        and by their fathers' houses,

004:035 from thirty years old and upward even to fifty years old,

        everyone who entered into the service, for work in the

        Tent of Meeting.

004:036 Those who were numbered of them by their families were two

        thousand seven hundred fifty.

004:037 These are those who were numbered of the families of the Kohathites,

        all who served in the Tent of Meeting, whom Moses and Aaron

        numbered according to the commandment of Yahweh by Moses.

004:038 Those who were numbered of the sons of Gershon, their families,

        and by their fathers' houses,

004:039 from thirty years old and upward even to fifty years old,

        everyone who entered into the service, for work in the

        Tent of Meeting,

004:040 even those who were numbered of them, by their families,

        by their fathers' houses, were two thousand six hundred thirty.

004:041 These are those who were numbered of the families of the sons

        of Gershon, all who served in the Tent of Meeting, whom Moses

        and Aaron numbered according to the commandment of Yahweh.

004:042 Those who were numbered of the families of the sons of Merari,

        by their families, by their fathers' houses,

004:043 from thirty years old and upward even to fifty years old,

        everyone who entered into the service, for work in the

        Tent of Meeting,

004:044 even those who were numbered of them by their families,

        were three thousand two hundred.

004:045 These are those who were numbered of the families of the sons

        of Merari, whom Moses and Aaron numbered according to the

        commandment of Yahweh by Moses.

004:046 All those who were numbered of the Levites, whom Moses and

        Aaron and the princes of Israel numbered, by their families,

        and by their fathers' houses,

004:047 from thirty years old and upward even to fifty years old,

        everyone who entered in to do the work of service, and the work

        of bearing burdens in the Tent of Meeting,

004:048 even those who were numbered of them, were eight thousand

        five hundred eighty.

004:049 According to the commandment of Yahweh they were numbered by Moses,

        everyone according to his service, and according to his burden.

        Thus were they numbered by him, as Yahweh commanded Moses.

005:001 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

005:002 "Command the children of Israel that they put out of the camp

        every leper, and everyone who has an issue, and whoever

        is unclean by the dead.

005:003 Both male and female shall you put out, outside of the camp

        shall you put them; that they not defile their camp,

        in the midst of which I dwell."

005:004 The children of Israel did so, and put them out outside of the camp;

        as Yahweh spoke to Moses, so did the children of Israel.

005:005 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

005:006 "Speak to the children of Israel:  When a man or woman commits

        any sin that men commit, so as to trespass against Yahweh,

        and that soul is guilty;

005:007 then he shall confess his sin which he has done, and he shall

        make restitution for his guilt in full, and add to it

        the fifth part of it, and give it to him in respect of whom

        he has been guilty.

005:008 But if the man has no kinsman to whom restitution may be made

        for the guilt, the restitution for guilt which is made to Yahweh

        shall be the priest's; besides the ram of the atonement,

        by which atonement shall be made for him.

005:009 Every heave offering of all the holy things of the children

        of Israel, which they present to the priest, shall be his.

005:010 Every man's holy things shall be his:  whatever any man gives

        the priest, it shall be his."

005:011 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

005:012 "Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them:

        If any man's wife goes astray, and is unfaithful to him,

005:013 and a man lies with her carnally, and it is hidden from the eyes

        of her husband, and is kept close, and she is defiled,

        and there is no witness against her, and she isn't taken

        in the act;

005:014 and the spirit of jealousy comes on him, and he is jealous

        of his wife, and she is defiled:  or if the spirit

        of jealousy comes on him, and he is jealous of his wife,

        and she isn't defiled:

005:015 then the man shall bring his wife to the priest, and shall bring

        her offering for her:  the tenth part of an ephah of barley meal.

        He shall pour no oil on it, nor put frankincense on it, for it

        is a meal offering of jealousy, a meal offering of memorial,

        bringing iniquity to memory.

005:016 The priest shall bring her near, and set her before Yahweh;

005:017 and the priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel;

        and of the dust that is on the floor of the tabernacle

        the priest shall take, and put it into the water.

005:018 The priest shall set the woman before Yahweh, and let the hair

        of the woman's head go loose, and put the meal offering of

        memorial in her hands, which is the meal offering of jealousy.

        The priest shall have in his hand the water of bitterness

        that brings a curse.

005:019 The priest shall cause her to swear, and shall tell the woman,

        'If no man has lain with you, and if you haven't gone aside

        to uncleanness, being under your husband, be free from this

        water of bitterness that brings a curse.

005:020 But if you have gone astray, being under your husband,

        and if you are defiled, and some man has lain with you

        besides your husband:'

005:021 then the priest shall cause the woman to swear with the oath

        of cursing, and the priest shall tell the woman, 'Yahweh make

        you a curse and an oath among your people, when Yahweh allows

        your thigh to fall away, and your body to swell;

005:022 and this water that brings a curse will go into your bowels,

        and make your body swell, and your thigh fall away.'

        The woman shall say, 'Amen, Amen.'

005:023 "The priest shall write these curses in a book, and he shall

        blot them out into the water of bitterness.

005:024 He shall make the woman drink the water of bitterness that causes

        the curse; and the water that causes the curse shall enter

        into her and become bitter.

005:025 The priest shall take the meal offering of jealousy out of the

        woman's hand, and shall wave the meal offering before Yahweh,

        and bring it to the altar.

005:026 The priest shall take a handful of the meal offering,

        as the memorial of it, and burn it on the altar, and afterward

        shall make the woman drink the water.

005:027 When he has made her drink the water, then it shall happen,

        if she is defiled, and has committed a trespass against

        her husband, that the water that causes the curse will

        enter into her and become bitter, and her body will swell,

        and her thigh will fall away:  and the woman will be a curse

        among her people.

005:028 If the woman isn't defiled, but is clean; then she shall be free,

        and shall conceive seed.

005:029 "This is the law of jealousy, when a wife, being under her husband,

        goes astray, and is defiled;

005:030 or when the spirit of jealousy comes on a man, and he is jealous

        of his wife; then he shall set the woman before Yahweh,

        and the priest shall execute on her all this law.

005:031 The man shall be free from iniquity, and that woman shall

        bear her iniquity."

006:001 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

006:002 "Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them:  When either

        man or woman shall make a special vow, the vow of a Nazirite,

        to separate himself to Yahweh,

006:003 he shall separate himself from wine and strong drink.

        He shall drink no vinegar of wine, or vinegar of fermented drink,

        neither shall he drink any juice of grapes, nor eat fresh

        grapes or dried.

006:004 All the days of his separation he shall eat nothing that is

        made of the grapevine, from the seeds even to the skins.

006:005 "All the days of his vow of separation there shall no

        razor come on his head, until the days are fulfilled,

        in which he separates himself to Yahweh.  He shall be holy.

        He shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow long.

006:006 "All the days that he separates himself to Yahweh he shall

        not go near a dead body.

006:007 He shall not make himself unclean for his father, or for

        his mother, for his brother, or for his sister, when they die;

        because his separation to God is on his head.

006:008 All the days of his separation he is holy to Yahweh.

006:009 "If any man dies very suddenly beside him, and he defiles the head

        of his separation; then he shall shave his head in the day

        of his cleansing.  On the seventh day he shall shave it.

006:010 On the eighth day he shall bring two turtledoves or two young

        pigeons to the priest, to the door of the Tent of Meeting.

006:011 The priest shall offer one for a sin offering, and the other

        for a burnt offering, and make atonement for him, because he

        sinned by reason of the dead, and shall make his head holy

        that same day.

006:012 He shall separate to Yahweh the days of his separation,

        and shall bring a male lamb a year old for a trespass offering;

        but the former days shall be void, because his separation

        was defiled.

006:013 "This is the law of the Nazirite:  when the days of his

        separation are fulfilled, he shall be brought to the door

        of the Tent of Meeting,

006:014 and he shall offer his offering to Yahweh, one male lamb

        a year old without blemish for a burnt offering, and one

        ewe lamb a year old without blemish for a sin offering,

        and one ram without blemish for peace offerings,

006:015 and a basket of unleavened bread, cakes of fine flour

        mixed with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil,

        and their meal offering, and their drink offerings.

006:016 The priest shall present them before Yahweh, and shall offer

        his sin offering, and his burnt offering.

006:017 He shall offer the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings

        to Yahweh, with the basket of unleavened bread.  The priest

        shall offer also its meal offering, and its drink offering.

006:018 The Nazirite shall shave the head of his separation at the door

        of the Tent of Meeting, and shall take the hair of the head

        of his separation, and put it on the fire which is under

        the sacrifice of peace offerings.

006:019 The priest shall take the boiled shoulder of the ram, and one

        unleavened cake out of the basket, and one unleavened wafer,

        and shall put them on the hands of the Nazirite, after he has

        shaved the head of his separation;

006:020 and the priest shall wave them for a wave offering before Yahweh.

        This is holy for the priest, together with the breast that is

        waved and the thigh that is offered.  After that the Nazirite

        may drink wine.

006:021 "This is the law of the Nazirite who vows, and of his offering

        to Yahweh for his separation, besides that which he is able to get.

        According to his vow which he vows, so he must do after the law

        of his separation."

006:022 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

006:023 "Speak to Aaron and to his sons, saying, 'This is how you

        shall bless the children of Israel.'  You shall tell them,

006:024 'Yahweh bless you, and keep you.

006:025 Yahweh make his face to shine on you, and be gracious to you.

006:026 Yahweh lift up his face toward you, and give you peace.'

006:027 "So they shall put my name on the children of Israel;

        and I will bless them."

007:001 It happened on the day that Moses had finished setting up

        the tabernacle, and had anointed it and sanctified it,

        with all its furniture, and the altar with all its vessels,

        and had anointed and sanctified them;

007:002 that the princes of Israel, the heads of their fathers'

        houses, offered.  These were the princes of the tribes.

        These are they who were over those who were numbered:

007:003 and they brought their offering before Yahweh, six covered wagons,

        and twelve oxen; a wagon for every two of the princes, and for

        each one an ox:  and they presented them before the tabernacle.

007:004 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

007:005 "Accept these from them, that they may be used in doing the service

        of the Tent of Meeting; and you shall give them to the Levites,

        to every man according to his service."

007:006 Moses took the wagons and the oxen, and gave them to the Levites.

007:007 He gave two wagons and four oxen to the sons of Gershon,

        according to their service:

007:008 and he gave four wagons and eight oxen to the sons of Merari,

        according to their service, under the direction of Ithamar

        the son of Aaron the priest.

007:009 But to the sons of Kohath he gave none, because the service

        of the sanctuary belonged to them; they carried it

        on their shoulders.

007:010 The princes gave offerings for the dedication of the altar

        in the day that it was anointed, even the princes gave their

        offerings before the altar.

007:011 Yahweh said to Moses, "They shall offer their offering,

        each prince on his day, for the dedication of the altar."

007:012 He who offered his offering the first day was Nahshon the son

        of Amminadab, of the tribe of Judah,

007:013 and his offering was:  one silver platter, the weight of which was

007:089 When Moses went into the Tent of Meeting to speak with Yahweh,

        he heard his voice speaking to him from above the mercy seat that

        was on the ark of the Testimony, from between the two cherubim:

        and he spoke to him.

008:001 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

008:002 "Speak to Aaron, and tell him, 'When you light the lamps,

        the seven lamps shall give light in front of the lampstand.'"

008:003 Aaron did so.  He lit its lamps to light the area in front

        of the lampstand, as Yahweh commanded Moses.

008:004 This was the workmanship of the lampstand, beaten work of gold.

        From its base to its flowers, it was beaten work:

        according to the pattern which Yahweh had shown Moses,

        so he made the lampstand.

008:005 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

008:006 "Take the Levites from among the children of Israel,

        and cleanse them.

008:007 Thus shall you do to them, to cleanse them:  sprinkle the water

        of cleansing on them, let them shave their whole bodies with a razor,

        and let them wash their clothes, and cleanse themselves.

008:008 Then let them take a young bull, and its meal offering,

        fine flour mixed with oil; and another young bull you shall

        take for a sin offering.

008:009 You shall present the Levites before the Tent of Meeting.

        You shall assemble the whole congregation of the children of Israel.

008:010 You shall present the Levites before Yahweh.  The children

        of Israel shall lay their hands on the Levites,

008:011 and Aaron shall offer the Levites before Yahweh for a wave offering,

        on the behalf of the children of Israel, that it may be theirs

        to do the service of Yahweh.

008:012 The Levites shall lay their hands on the heads of the bulls,

        and you shall offer the one for a sin offering, and the other for

        a burnt offering to Yahweh, to make atonement for the Levites.

008:013 You shall set the Levites before Aaron, and before his sons,

        and offer them as a wave offering to Yahweh.

008:014 Thus you shall separate the Levites from among the children

        of Israel, and the Levites shall be mine.

008:015 "After that, the Levites shall go in to do the service of

        the Tent of Meeting:  and you shall cleanse them, and offer

        them as a wave offering.

008:016 For they are wholly given to me from among the children of Israel;

        instead of all who open the womb, even the firstborn of all

        the children of Israel, I have taken them to me.

008:017 For all the firstborn among the children of Israel are mine,

        both man and animal.  On the day that I struck all the firstborn

        in the land of Egypt, I sanctified them for myself.

008:018 I have taken the Levites instead of all the firstborn among

        the children of Israel.

008:019 I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and to his sons

        from among the children of Israel, to do the service of

        the children of Israel in the Tent of Meeting, and to make

        atonement for the children of Israel; that there be no plague

        among the children of Israel, when the children of Israel

        come near to the sanctuary."

008:020 Thus did Moses, and Aaron, and all the congregation of the children

        of Israel, to the Levites.  According to all that Yahweh

        commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so the children

        of Israel did to them.

008:021 The Levites purified themselves from sin, and they washed

        their clothes; and Aaron offered them for a wave offering

        before Yahweh; and Aaron made atonement for them to cleanse them.

008:022 After that, the Levites went in to do their service in

        the Tent of Meeting before Aaron, and before his sons:

        as Yahweh had commanded Moses concerning the Levites,

        so they did to them.

008:023 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

008:024 "This is that which belongs to the Levites:  from twenty-five

        years old and upward they shall go in to wait on the service

        in the work of the Tent of Meeting;

008:025 and from the age of fifty years they shall cease waiting

        on the work, and shall serve no more,

008:026 but shall minister with their brothers in the Tent

        of Meeting, to keep the charge, and shall do no service.

        Thus shall you do to the Levites concerning their duties."

009:001 Yahweh spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the first

        month of the second year after they had come out of the land

        of Egypt, saying,

009:002 "Moreover let the children of Israel keep the Passover

        in its appointed season.

009:003 On the fourteenth day of this month, at evening, you shall keep

        it in its appointed season--according to all its statutes,

        and according to all its ordinances, you shall keep it."

009:004 Moses spoke to the children of Israel, that they should

        keep the Passover.

009:005 They kept the Passover in the first month, on the fourteenth

        day of the month, at evening, in the wilderness of Sinai.

        According to all that Yahweh commanded Moses, so the children

        of Israel did.

009:006 There were certain men, who were unclean because of the dead body

        of a man, so that they could not keep the Passover on that day,

        and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day.

009:007 Those men said to him, "We are unclean because of the dead

        body of a man.  Why are we kept back, that we may not offer

        the offering of Yahweh in its appointed season among

        the children of Israel?"

009:008 Moses answered them, "Wait, that I may hear what Yahweh will

        command concerning you."

009:009 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

009:010 "Say to the children of Israel, 'If any man of you or of your

        generations is unclean by reason of a dead body, or is on a

        journey far away, he shall still keep the Passover to Yahweh.

009:011 In the second month, on the fourteenth day at evening they

        shall keep it; they shall eat it with unleavened bread

        and bitter herbs.

009:012 They shall leave none of it until the morning, nor break a bone

        of it.  According to all the statute of the Passover they

        shall keep it.

009:013 But the man who is clean, and is not on a journey, and fails

        to keep the Passover, that soul shall be cut off from his people.

        Because he didn't offer the offering of Yahweh in its

        appointed season, that man shall bear his sin.

009:014 If a foreigner lives among you, and desires to keep the Passover

        to Yahweh; according to the statute of the Passover,

        and according to its ordinance, so shall he do.

        You shall have one statute, both for the foreigner, and for him

        who is born in the land.'"

009:015 On the day that the tabernacle was raised up, the cloud

        covered the tabernacle, even the Tent of the Testimony:

        and at evening it was over the tabernacle as it were

        the appearance of fire, until morning.

009:016 So it was continually.  The cloud covered it, and the appearance

        of fire by night.

009:017 Whenever the cloud was taken up from over the Tent, then after

        that the children of Israel traveled; and in the place where

        the cloud remained, there the children of Israel encamped.

009:018 At the commandment of Yahweh, the children of Israel traveled,

        and at the commandment of Yahweh they encamped.  As long

        as the cloud remained on the tabernacle they remained encamped.

009:019 When the cloud stayed on the tabernacle many days,

        then the children of Israel kept the charge of Yahweh,

        and didn't travel.

009:020 Sometimes the cloud was a few days on the tabernacle;

        then according to the commandment of Yahweh they remained encamped,

        and according to the commandment of Yahweh they traveled.

009:021 Sometimes the cloud was from evening until morning;

        and when the cloud was taken up in the morning, they traveled:

        or by day and by night, when the cloud was taken up, they traveled.

009:022 Whether it was two days, or a month, or a year that the cloud

        stayed on the tabernacle, remaining on it, the children

        of Israel remained encamped, and didn't travel; but when it

        was taken up, they traveled.

009:023 At the commandment of Yahweh they encamped, and at the commandment

        of Yahweh they traveled.  They kept the charge of Yahweh,

        at the commandment of Yahweh by Moses.

010:001 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

010:002 Make you two trumpets of silver; of beaten work shall you make them:

        and you shall use them for the calling of the congregation,

        and for the journeying of the camps.

010:003 When they shall blow them, all the congregation shall gather

        themselves to you at the door of the tent of meeting.

010:004 If they blow but one, then the princes, the heads of the thousands

        of Israel, shall gather themselves to you.

010:005 When you blow an alarm, the camps that lie on the east side

        shall take their journey.

010:006 When you blow an alarm the second time, the camps that lie

        on the south side shall take their journey:  they shall blow

        an alarm for their journeys.

010:007 But when the assembly is to be gathered together, you shall blow,

        but you shall not sound an alarm.

010:008 The sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow the trumpets; and they

        shall be to you for a statute forever throughout your generations.

010:009 When you go to war in your land against the adversary who

        oppresses you, then you shall sound an alarm with the trumpets;

        and you shall be remembered before Yahweh your God, and you

        shall be saved from your enemies.

010:010 Also in the day of your gladness, and in your set feasts,

        and in the beginnings of your months, you shall blow the trumpets

        over your burnt offerings, and over the sacrifices of your

        peace offerings; and they shall be to you for a memorial

        before your God:  I am Yahweh your God.

010:011 It happened in the second year, in the second month,

        on the twentieth day of the month, that the cloud was taken

        up from over the tent of the testimony.

010:012 The children of Israel set forward according to their journeys

        out of the wilderness of Sinai; and the cloud abode in

        the wilderness of Paran.

010:013 They first took their journey according to the commandment

        of Yahweh by Moses.

010:014 In the first [place] the standard of the camp of the children

        of Judah set forward according to their armies:

        and over his army was Nahshon the son of Amminadab.

010:015 Over the army of the tribe of the children of Issachar was

        Nethanel the son of Zuar.

010:016 Over the army of the tribe of the children of Zebulun was Eliab

        the son of Helon.

010:017 The tent was taken down; and the sons of Gershon and the sons

        of Merari, who bore the tent, set forward.

010:018 The standard of the camp of Reuben set forward according to

        their armies:  and over his army was Elizur the son of Shedeur.

010:019 Over the army of the tribe of the children of Simeon was

        Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai.

010:020 Over the army of the tribe of the children of Gad was Eliasaph

        the son of Deuel.

010:021 The Kohathites set forward, bearing the sanctuary:

        and [the others] did set up the tent against their coming.

010:022 The standard of the camp of the children of Ephraim set forward

        according to their armies:  and over his army was Elishama

        the son of Ammihud.

010:023 Over the army of the tribe of the children of Manasseh was

        Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur.

010:024 Over the army of the tribe of the children of Benjamin was

        Abidan the son of Gideoni.

010:025 The standard of the camp of the children of Dan, which was the

        rearward of all the camps, set forward according to their armies:

        and over his army was Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai.

010:026 Over the army of the tribe of the children of Asher was Pagiel

        the son of Ochran.

010:027 Over the army of the tribe of the children of Naphtali was Ahira

        the son of Enan.

010:028 Thus were the travels of the children of Israel according

        to their armies; and they set forward.

010:029 Moses said to Hobab, the son of Reuel the Midianite, Moses'

        father-in-law, We are journeying to the place of which Yahweh said,

        I will give it to you:  come you with us, and we will do you good;

        for Yahweh has spoken good concerning Israel.

010:030 He said to him, I will not go; but I will depart to my own land,

        and to my relatives.

010:031 He said, Don't leave us, please; because you know how we

        are to encamp in the wilderness, and you shall be to us

        instead of eyes.

010:032 It shall be, if you go with us, yes, it shall be, that whatever

        good Yahweh shall do to us, the same will we do to you.

010:033 They set forward from the Mount of Yahweh three days' journey;

        and the ark of the covenant of Yahweh went before them

        three days' journey, to seek out a resting place for them.

010:034 The cloud of Yahweh was over them by day, when they set forward

        from the camp.

010:035 It happened, when the ark set forward, that Moses said,

        Rise up, Yahweh, and let your enemies be scattered;

        and let those who hate you flee before you.

010:036 When it rested, he said, Return, Yahweh, to the ten thousands

        of the thousands of Israel.

011:001 The people were as murmurers, [speaking] evil in the ears of Yahweh:

        and when Yahweh heard it, his anger was kindled; and the fire

        of Yahweh burnt among them, and devoured in the uttermost

        part of the camp.

011:002 The people cried to Moses; and Moses prayed to Yahweh,

        and the fire abated.

011:003 The name of that place was called Taberah, because the fire

        of Yahweh burnt among them.

011:004 The mixed multitude that was among them lusted exceedingly:

        and the children of Israel also wept again, and said,

        Who shall give us flesh to eat?

011:005 We remember the fish, which we ate in Egypt for nothing;

        the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions,

        and the garlic:

011:006 but now our soul is dried away; there is nothing at all save

        this manna to look on.

011:007 The manna was like coriander seed, and the appearance of it

        as the appearance of bdellium.

011:008 The people went about, and gathered it, and ground it in mills,

        or beat it in mortars, and boiled it in pots, and made cakes of it:

        and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil.

011:009 When the dew fell on the camp in the night, the manna fell on it.

011:010 Moses heard the people weeping throughout their families,

        every man at the door of his tent:  and the anger of Yahweh

        was kindled greatly; and Moses was displeased.

011:011 Moses said to Yahweh, Why have you dealt ill with your servant?

        and why haven't I found favor in your sight, that you lay

        the burden of all this people on me?

011:012 Have I conceived all this people?  Have I brought them forth,

        that you should tell me, Carry them in your bosom,

        as a nurse carries a nursing infant, to the land which you

        swore to their fathers?

011:013 Where should I get meat to give to all this people? for they

        weep to me, saying, Give us meat, that we may eat.

011:014 I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is

        too heavy for me.

011:015 If you deal thus with me, please kill me out of hand, if I have

        found favor in your sight; and let me not see my wretchedness.

011:016 Yahweh said to Moses, Gather to me seventy men of the elders

        of Israel, whom you know to be the elders of the people,

        and officers over them; and bring them to the tent of meeting,

        that they may stand there with you.

011:017 I will come down and talk with you there:  and I will take

        of the Spirit which is on you, and will put it on them;

        and they shall bear the burden of the people with you,

        that you not bear it yourself alone.

011:018 Say you to the people, Sanctify yourselves against tomorrow,

        and you shall eat flesh; for you have wept in the ears

        of Yahweh, saying, Who shall give us flesh to eat? for it was

        well with us in Egypt:  therefore Yahweh will give you flesh,

        and you shall eat.

011:019 You shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days,

        neither ten days, nor twenty days,

011:020 but a whole month, until it come out at your nostrils, and it

        be loathsome to you; because that you have rejected Yahweh

        who is among you, and have wept before him, saying, Why came

        we forth out of Egypt?

011:021 Moses said, The people, among whom I am, are six hundred

        thousand footmen; and you have said, I will give them flesh,

        that they may eat a whole month.

011:022 Shall flocks and herds be slain for them, to suffice them?

        or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them,

        to suffice them?

011:023 Yahweh said to Moses, Has Yahweh's hand grown short? now shall

        you see whether my word shall happen to you or not.

011:024 Moses went out, and told the people the words of Yahweh:

        and he gathered seventy men of the elders of the people,

        and set them round about the Tent.

011:025 Yahweh came down in the cloud, and spoke to him, and took of

        the Spirit that was on him, and put it on the seventy elders:

        and it happened that when the Spirit rested on them,

        they prophesied, but they did so no more.

011:026 But there remained two men in the camp, the name of the one was Eldad,

        and the name of the other Medad:  and the Spirit rested on them;

        and they were of those who were written, but had not gone

        out to the Tent; and they prophesied in the camp.

011:027 There ran a young man, and told Moses, and said, Eldad and Medad

        do prophesy in the camp.

011:028 Joshua the son of Nun, the minister of Moses, one of his

        chosen men, answered, My lord Moses, forbid them.

011:029 Moses said to him, Are you jealous for my sake?

        I wish that all Yahweh's people were prophets, that Yahweh

        would put his Spirit on them!

011:030 Moses got him into the camp, he and the elders of Israel.

011:031 There went forth a wind from Yahweh, and brought quails

        from the sea, and let them fall by the camp, about a day's

        journey on this side, and a day's journey on the other side,

        round about the camp, and about two cubits above the surface

        of the earth.

011:032 The people rose up all that day, and all the night,

        and all the next day, and gathered the quails:

        he who gathered least gathered ten homers:  and they spread

        them all abroad for themselves round about the camp.

011:033 While the flesh was yet between their teeth, before it was chewed,

        the anger of Yahweh was kindled against the people, and Yahweh

        struck the people with a very great plague.

011:034 The name of that place was called Kibrothhattaavah, because there

        they buried the people who lusted.

011:035 From Kibrothhattaavah the people traveled to Hazeroth;

        and they abode at Hazeroth.

012:001 Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the Cushite

        woman whom he had married; for he had married a Cushite woman.

012:002 They said, Has Yahweh indeed spoken only with Moses?  Hasn't he

        spoken also with us?  Yahweh heard it.

012:003 Now the man Moses was very humble, above all the men who were

        on the surface of the earth.

012:004 Yahweh spoke suddenly to Moses, and to Aaron,

        and to Miriam, Come out you three to the tent of meeting.

        They three came out.

012:005 Yahweh came down in a pillar of cloud, and stood at the door of

        the Tent, and called Aaron and Miriam; and they both came forth.

012:006 He said, Hear now my words:  if there be a prophet among you,

        I Yahweh will make myself known to him in a vision, I will

        speak with him in a dream.

012:007 My servant Moses is not so; he is faithful in all my house:

012:008 with him will I speak mouth to mouth, even manifestly,

        and not in dark speeches; and the form of Yahweh shall he see:

        why then were you not afraid to speak against my servant,

        against Moses?

012:009 The anger of Yahweh was kindled against them; and he departed.

012:010 The cloud removed from over the Tent; and behold, Miriam was leprous,

        as [white as] snow:  and Aaron looked at Miriam, and behold,

        she was leprous.

012:011 Aaron said to Moses, Oh, my lord, please don't lay sin on us,

        for that we have done foolishly, and for that we have sinned.

012:012 Let her not, I pray, be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half

        consumed when he comes out of his mother's womb.

012:013 Moses cried to Yahweh, saying, Heal her, God, I beg you.

012:014 Yahweh said to Moses, If her father had but spit in her face,

        shouldn't she be ashamed seven days? let her be shut up

        outside of the camp seven days, and after that she shall

        be brought in again.

012:015 Miriam was shut up outside of the camp seven days:

        and the people didn't travel until Miriam was brought in again.

012:016 Afterward the people traveled from Hazeroth, and encamped

        in the wilderness of Paran.

013:001 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

013:002 Send you men, that they may spy out the land of Canaan,

        which I give to the children of Israel:  of every tribe of their

        fathers shall you send a man, everyone a prince among them.

013:003 Moses sent them from the wilderness of Paran according to

        the commandment of Yahweh:  all of them men who were heads

        of the children of Israel.

013:004 These were their names:  Of the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the

        son of Zaccur.

013:005 Of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori.

013:006 Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh.

013:007 Of the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph.

013:008 Of the tribe of Ephraim, Hoshea the son of Nun.

013:009 Of the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu.

013:010 Of the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi.

013:011 Of the tribe of Joseph, [namely], of the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi

        the son of Susi.

013:012 Of the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli.

013:013 Of the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael.

013:014 Of the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi.

013:015 Of the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi.

013:016 These are the names of the men who Moses sent to spy out the land.

        Moses called Hoshea the son of Nun Joshua.

013:017 Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said to them,

        Go up this way by the South, and go up into the hill country:

013:018 and see the land, what it is; and the people who dwell therein,

        whether they are strong or weak, whether they are few or many;

013:019 and what the land is that they dwell in, whether it is good or bad;

        and what cities they are that they dwell in, whether in camps,

        or in strongholds;

013:020 and what the land is, whether it is fat or lean,

        whether there is wood therein, or not.  Be of good courage,

        and bring of the fruit of the land.  Now the time was the time

        of the first-ripe grapes.

013:021 So they went up, and spied out the land from the wilderness

        of Zin to Rehob, to the entrance of Hamath.

013:022 They went up by the South, and came to Hebron;

        and Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, were there.

        (Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)

013:023 They came to the valley of Eshcol, and cut down from there

        a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bore it on

        a staff between two; [they brought] also of the pomegranates,

        and of the figs.

013:024 That place was called the valley of Eshcol, because of the cluster

        which the children of Israel cut down from there.

013:025 They returned from spying out the land at the end of forty days.

013:026 They went and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the congregation

        of the children of Israel, to the wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh;

        and brought back word to them, and to all the congregation,

        and shown them the fruit of the land.

013:027 They told him, and said, We came to the land where you sent us;

        and surely it flows with milk and honey; and this is

        the fruit of it.

013:028 However the people who dwell in the land are strong,

        and the cities are fortified, [and] very great:

        and moreover we saw the children of Anak there.

013:029 Amalek dwells in the land of the South:  and the Hittite,

        and the Jebusite, and the Amorite, dwell in the hill country;

        and the Canaanite dwells by the sea, and along by the side

        of the Jordan.

013:030 Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, Let us go up

        at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it.

013:031 But the men who went up with him said, We aren't able to go

        up against the people; for they are stronger than we.

013:032 They brought up an evil report of the land which they had

        spied out to the children of Israel, saying, The land,

        through which we have gone to spy it out, is a land that eats

        up the inhabitants of it; and all the people who we saw in it

        are men of great stature.

013:033 There we saw the Nephilim, the sons of Anak, who come of

        the Nephilim:  and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers,

        and so we were in their sight.

014:001 All the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried;

        and the people wept that night.

014:002 All the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron:

        and the whole congregation said to them, Would that we

        had died in the land of Egypt! or would that we had died

        in this wilderness!

014:003 Why does Yahweh bring us to this land, to fall by the sword?

        Our wives and our little ones will be a prey:  wouldn't it

        be better for us to return into Egypt?

014:004 They said one to another, Let us make a captain, and let us

        return into Egypt.

014:005 Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly

        of the congregation of the children of Israel.

014:006 Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh,

        who were of those who spied out the land, tore their clothes:

014:007 and they spoke to all the congregation of the children of Israel,

        saying, The land, which we passed through to spy it out,

        is an exceeding good land.

014:008 If Yahweh delight in us, then he will bring us into this land,

        and give it to us; a land which flows with milk and honey.

014:009 Only don't rebel against Yahweh, neither fear the people

        of the land; for they are bread for us:  their defense

        is removed from over them, and Yahweh is with us:

        don't fear them.

014:010 But all the congregation bade stone them with stones.

        The glory of Yahweh appeared in the tent of meeting to all

        the children of Israel.

014:011 Yahweh said to Moses, How long will this people despise me?

        and how long will they not believe in me, for all the signs

        which I have worked among them?

014:012 I will strike them with the pestilence, and disinherit them,

        and will make of you a nation greater and mightier than they.

014:013 Moses said to Yahweh, Then the Egyptians will hear it;

        for you brought up this people in your might from among them;

014:014 and they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land.

        They have heard that you Yahweh are in the midst of this people;

        for you Yahweh are seen face to face, and your cloud stands

        over them, and you go before them, in a pillar of cloud by day,

        and in a pillar of fire by night.

014:015 Now if you shall kill this people as one man, then the nations

        which have heard the fame of you will speak, saying,

014:016 Because Yahweh was not able to bring this people into

        the land which he swore to them, therefore he has slain them

        in the wilderness.

014:017 Now please let the power of the Lord be great, according as you

        have spoken, saying,

014:018 Yahweh is slow to anger, and abundant in loving kindness,

        forgiving iniquity and disobedience; and that will by no means

        clear [the guilty], visiting the iniquity of the fathers

        on the children, on the third and on the fourth generation.

014:019 Pardon, Please, the iniquity of this people according to

        the greatness of your loving kindness, and according as you

        have forgiven this people, from Egypt even until now.

014:020 Yahweh said, I have pardoned according to your word:

014:021 but in very deed, as I live, and as all the earth shall be

        filled with the glory of Yahweh;

014:022 because all those men who have seen my glory, and my signs,

        which I worked in Egypt and in the wilderness, yet have tempted

        me these ten times, and have not listened to my voice;

014:023 surely they shall not see the land which I swore to their fathers,

        neither shall any of those who despised me see it:

014:024 but my servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him,

        and has followed me fully, him will I bring into the land

        into which he went; and his seed shall possess it.

014:025 Now the Amalekite and the Canaanite dwell in the valley:

        tomorrow turn you, and get you into the wilderness by the way

        to the Red Sea{or, Sea of Reeds}.

014:026 Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,

014:027 How long [shall I bear] with this evil congregation, that murmur

        against me?  I have heard the murmurings of the children

        of Israel, which they murmur against me.

014:028 Tell them, As I live, says Yahweh, surely as you have spoken

        in my ears, so will I do to you:

014:029 your dead bodies shall fall in this wilderness; and all

        who were numbered of you, according to your whole number,

        from twenty years old and upward, who have murmured against me,

014:030 surely you shall not come into the land, concerning which I

        swore that I would make you dwell therein, save Caleb the son

        of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun.

014:031 But your little ones, that you said should be a prey,

        them will I bring in, and they shall know the land which

        you have rejected.

014:032 But as for you, your dead bodies shall fall in this wilderness.

014:033 Your children shall be wanderers in the wilderness forty years,

        and shall bear your prostitution, until your dead bodies

        be consumed in the wilderness.

014:034 After the number of the days in which you spied out the land,

        even forty days, for every day a year, shall you bear your

        iniquities, even forty years, and you shall know my alienation.

014:035 I, Yahweh, have spoken, surely this will I do to all this

        evil congregation, who are gathered together against me:

        in this wilderness they shall be consumed, and there

        they shall die.

014:036 The men, whom Moses sent to spy out the land, who returned,

        and made all the congregation to murmur against him,

        by bringing up an evil report against the land,

014:037 even those men who did bring up an evil report of the land,

        died by the plague before Yahweh.

014:038 But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh,

        remained alive of those men who went to spy out the land.

014:039 Moses told these words to all the children of Israel:

        and the people mourned greatly.

014:040 They rose up early in the morning, and got them up

        to the top of the mountain, saying, Behold, we are here,

        and will go up to the place which Yahweh has promised:

        for we have sinned.

014:041 Moses said, Why now do you disobey the commandment of Yahweh,

        seeing it shall not prosper?

014:042 Don't go up, for Yahweh isn't among you; that you not be struck

        down before your enemies.

014:043 For there the Amalekite and the Canaanite are before you,

        and you shall fall by the sword:  because you are turned back

        from following Yahweh, therefore Yahweh will not be with you.

014:044 But they presumed to go up to the top of the mountain:

        nevertheless the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, and Moses,

        didn't depart out of the camp.

014:045 Then the Amalekite came down, and the Canaanite who lived

        in that mountain, and struck them and beat them down,

        even to Hormah.

015:001 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

015:002 Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them, When you are

        come into the land of your habitations, which I give to you,

015:003 and will make an offering by fire to Yahweh, a burnt offering,

        or a sacrifice, to accomplish a vow, or as a freewill offering,

        or in your set feasts, to make a sweet savor to Yahweh,

        of the herd, or of the flock;

015:004 then shall he who offers his offering offer to Yahweh a meal

        offering of a tenth part [of an ephah] of fine flour mixed

        with the fourth part of a hin of oil:

015:005 and wine for the drink offering, the fourth part of a hin,

        shall you prepare with the burnt offering, or for the sacrifice,

        for each lamb.

015:006 Or for a ram, you shall prepare for a meal offering two tenth

        parts [of an ephah] of fine flour mixed with the third part

        of a hin of oil:

015:007 and for the drink offering you shall offer the third part

        of a hin of wine, of a sweet savor to Yahweh.

015:008 When you prepare a bull for a burnt offering, or for a sacrifice,

        to accomplish a vow, or for peace offerings to Yahweh;

015:009 then shall he offer with the bull a meal offering of three tenth

        parts [of an ephah] of fine flour mixed with half a hin of oil:

015:010 and you shall offer for the drink offering half a hin of wine,

        for an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor to Yahweh.

015:011 Thus shall it be done for each bull, or for each ram,

        or for each of the male lambs, or of the young goats.

015:012 According to the number that you shall prepare, so shall you

        do to everyone according to their number.

015:013 All who are native-born shall do these things after this manner,

        in offering an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor to Yahweh.

015:014 If a stranger lives as a foreigner with you, or whoever may

        be among you throughout your generations, and will offer

        an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor to Yahweh;

        as you do, so he shall do.

015:015 For the assembly, there shall be one statute for you,

        and for the stranger who lives as a foreigner [with you],

        a statute forever throughout your generations:  as you are,

        so shall the foreigner be before Yahweh.

015:016 One law and one ordinance shall be for you, and for the stranger

        who lives as a foreigner with you.

015:017 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

015:018 Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them, When you come

        into the land where I bring you,

015:019 then it shall be that when you eat of the bread of the land,

        you shall offer up a wave offering to Yahweh.

015:020 Of the first of your dough you shall offer up a cake for a

        wave offering:  as the wave offering of the threshing floor,

        so shall you heave it.

015:021 Of the first of your dough you shall give to Yahweh a wave

        offering throughout your generations.

015:022 When you shall err, and not observe all these commandments,

        which Yahweh has spoken to Moses,

015:023 even all that Yahweh has commanded you by Moses, from the day that

        Yahweh gave commandment, and onward throughout your generations;

015:024 then it shall be, if it be done unwittingly, without the knowledge

        of the congregation, that all the congregation shall offer one

        young bull for a burnt offering, for a sweet savor to Yahweh,

        with the meal offering of it, and the drink offering of it,

        according to the ordinance, and one male goat for a sin offering.

015:025 The priest shall make atonement for all the congregation

        of the children of Israel, and they shall be forgiven;

        for it was an error, and they have brought their offering,

        an offering made by fire to Yahweh, and their sin offering

        before Yahweh, for their error:

015:026 and all the congregation of the children of Israel shall

        be forgiven, and the stranger who lives as a foreigner among them;

        for in respect of all the people it was done unwittingly.

015:027 If one person sins unwittingly, then he shall offer a female

        goat a year old for a sin offering.

015:028 The priest shall make atonement for the soul who errs,

        when he sins unwittingly, before Yahweh, to make atonement for him;

        and he shall be forgiven.

015:029 You shall have one law for him who does anything unwittingly,

        for him who is native-born among the children of Israel,

        and for the stranger who lives as a foreigner among them.

015:030 But the soul who does anything with a high hand, whether he is

        native-born or a foreigner, the same blasphemes Yahweh;

        and that soul shall be cut off from among his people.

015:031 Because he has despised the word of Yahweh, and has broken

        his commandment, that soul shall utterly be cut off;

        his iniquity shall be on him.

015:032 While the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they found

        a man gathering sticks on the Sabbath day.

015:033 Those who found him gathering sticks brought him to Moses

        and Aaron, and to all the congregation.

015:034 They put him in custody, because it had not been declared

        what should be done to him.

015:035 Yahweh said to Moses, The man shall surely be put to death:

        all the congregation shall stone him with stones outside

        of the camp.

015:036 All the congregation brought him outside of the camp, and stoned

        him to death with stones; as Yahweh commanded Moses.

015:037 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

015:038 Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them that they

        should make them fringes{or, tassels (Hebrew tzitzit)} in

        the borders of their garments throughout their generations,

        and that they put on the fringe{or, tassel} of each border

        a cord of blue:

015:039 and it shall be to you for a fringe{or, tassel}, that you may look

        on it, and remember all the commandments of Yahweh, and do them;

        and that you not follow after your own heart and your own eyes,

        after which you use to play the prostitute;

015:040 that you may remember and do all my commandments, and be holy

        to your God.

015:041 I am Yahweh your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt,

        to be your God:  I am Yahweh your God.

016:001 Now Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi,

        with Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On, the son

        of Peleth, sons of Reuben, took [men]:

016:002 and they rose up before Moses, with certain of the children

        of Israel, two hundred fifty princes of the congregation,

        called to the assembly, men of renown;

016:003 and they assembled themselves together against Moses and

        against Aaron, and said to them, You take too much on you,

        seeing all the congregation are holy, everyone of them,

        and Yahweh is among them:  why then lift yourselves up above

        the assembly of Yahweh?

016:004 When Moses heard it, he fell on his face:

016:005 and he spoke to Korah and to all his company, saying, In the

        morning Yahweh will show who are his, and who is holy,

        and will cause him to come near to him:  even him whom he shall

        choose he will cause to come near to him.

016:006 This do:  take you censers, Korah, and all his company;

016:007 and put fire in them, and put incense on them before Yahweh tomorrow:

        and it shall be that the man whom Yahweh does choose, he [shall

        be] holy:  you take too much on you, you sons of Levi.

016:008 Moses said to Korah, Hear now, you sons of Levi:

016:009 [seems it but] a small thing to you, that the God of Israel

        has separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring

        you near to himself, to do the service of the tent of Yahweh,

        and to stand before the congregation to minister to them;

016:010 and that he has brought you near, and all your brothers the sons

        of Levi with you? and seek you the priesthood also?

016:011 Therefore you and all your company are gathered together

        against Yahweh:  and Aaron, what is he who you murmur against him?

016:012 Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab;

        and they said, We won't come up:

016:013 is it a small thing that you have brought us up out of a land

        flowing with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness,

        but you must needs make yourself also a prince over us?

016:014 Moreover you haven't brought us into a land flowing with milk

        and honey, nor given us inheritance of fields and vineyards:

        will you put out the eyes of these men? we won't come up.

016:015 Moses was very angry, and said to Yahweh, "Don't respect

        their offering:  I have not taken one donkey from them,

        neither have I hurt one of them."

016:016 Moses said to Korah, You and all your company go before Yahweh,

        you, and they, and Aaron, tomorrow:

016:017 and take every man his censer, and put incense on them,

        and bring you before Yahweh every man his censer, two hundred

        fifty censers; you also, and Aaron, each his censer.

016:018 They took every man his censer, and put fire in them,

        and laid incense thereon, and stood at the door of the tent

        of meeting with Moses and Aaron.

016:019 Korah assembled all the congregation against them to the door

        of the tent of meeting:  and the glory of Yahweh appeared

        to all the congregation.

016:020 Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,

016:021 Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may

        consume them in a moment.

016:022 They fell on their faces, and said, God, the God of the spirits

        of all flesh, shall one man sin, and will you be angry

        with all the congregation?

016:023 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

016:024 Speak to the congregation, saying, Get away from around the tent

        of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.

016:025 Moses rose up and went to Dathan and Abiram; and the elders

        of Israel followed him.

016:026 He spoke to the congregation, saying, Depart, I pray you,

        from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs,

        lest you be consumed in all their sins.

016:027 So they got them up from the tent of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram,

        on every side:  and Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood

        at the door of their tents, and their wives, and their sons,

        and their little ones.

016:028 Moses said, Hereby you shall know that Yahweh has sent me to do

        all these works; for [I have] not [done them] of my own mind.

016:029 If these men die the common death of all men, or if they

        be visited after the visitation of all men; then Yahweh

        hasn't sent me.

016:030 But if Yahweh make a new thing, and the ground open its mouth,

        and swallow them up, with all that appertain to them,

        and they go down alive into Sheol; then you shall understand

        that these men have despised Yahweh.

016:031 It happened, as he made an end of speaking all these words,

        that the ground split apart that was under them;

016:032 and the earth opened its mouth, and swallowed them up,

        and their households, and all the men who appertained to Korah,

        and all their goods.

016:033 So they, and all that appertained to them, went down alive

        into Sheol:  and the earth closed on them, and they perished

        from among the assembly.

016:034 All Israel that were round about them fled at the cry of them;

        for they said, Lest the earth swallow us up.

016:035 Fire came forth from Yahweh, and devoured the two hundred

        fifty men who offered the incense.

016:036 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

016:037 Speak to Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, that he take up

        the censers out of the burning, and scatter you the fire yonder;

        for they are holy,

016:038 even the censers of these sinners against their own lives;

        and let them be made beaten plates for a covering of the altar:

        for they offered them before Yahweh; therefore they are holy;

        and they shall be a sign to the children of Israel.

016:039 Eleazar the priest took the bronze censers, which those who

        were burnt had offered; and they beat them out for a covering

        of the altar,

016:040 to be a memorial to the children of Israel, to the end that

        no stranger, who isn't of the seed of Aaron, comes near to burn

        incense before Yahweh; that he not be as Korah, and as his company:

        as Yahweh spoke to him by Moses.

016:041 But on the next day all the congregation of the children of Israel

        murmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying, You have

        killed the people of Yahweh.

016:042 It happened, when the congregation was assembled against Moses

        and against Aaron, that they looked toward the tent of meeting:

        and behold, the cloud covered it, and the glory of Yahweh appeared.

016:043 Moses and Aaron came to the front of the tent of meeting.

016:044 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

016:045 Get away from among this congregation, that I may consume them

        in a moment.  They fell on their faces.

016:046 Moses said to Aaron, Take your censer, and put fire therein

        from off the altar, and lay incense thereon, and carry it

        quickly to the congregation, and make atonement for them:

        for there is wrath gone out from Yahweh; the plague is begun.

016:047 Aaron took as Moses spoke, and ran into the midst of the assembly;

        and behold, the plague was begun among the people:

        and he put on the incense, and made atonement for the people.

016:048 He stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was stayed.

016:049 Now those who died by the plague were fourteen thousand and

        seven hundred, besides those who died about the matter of Korah.

016:050 Aaron returned to Moses to the door of the tent of meeting:

        and the plague was stayed.

017:001 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

017:002 Speak to the children of Israel, and take of them rods,

        one for each fathers' house, of all their princes according

        to their fathers' houses, twelve rods:  write you every man's

        name on his rod.

017:003 You shall write Aaron's name on the rod of Levi; for there

        shall be one rod for each head of their fathers' houses.

017:004 You shall lay them up in the tent of meeting before the testimony,

        where I meet with you.

017:005 It shall happen, that the rod of the man whom I shall choose

        shall bud:  and I will make to cease from me the murmurings

        of the children of Israel, which they murmur against you.

017:006 Moses spoke to the children of Israel; and all their princes

        gave him rods, for each prince one, according to their fathers'

        houses, even twelve rods:  and the rod of Aaron was

        among their rods.

017:007 Moses laid up the rods before Yahweh in the tent of the testimony.

017:008 It happened on the next day, that Moses went into the tent

        of the testimony; and behold, the rod of Aaron for the house

        of Levi was budded, and put forth buds, and produced blossoms,

        and bore ripe almonds.

017:009 Moses brought out all the rods from before Yahweh to all

        the children of Israel:  and they looked, and took every

        man his rod.

017:010 Yahweh said to Moses, Put back the rod of Aaron before the testimony,

        to be kept for a token against the children of rebellion;

        that you may make an end of their murmurings against me,

        that they not die.

017:011 Thus did Moses:  as Yahweh commanded him, so did he.

017:012 The children of Israel spoke to Moses, saying, Behold, we perish,

        we are undone, we are all undone.

017:013 Everyone who comes near, who comes near to the tent of Yahweh, dies:

        shall we perish all of us?

018:001 Yahweh said to Aaron, You and your sons and your fathers'

        house with you shall bear the iniquity of the sanctuary;

        and you and your sons with you shall bear the iniquity

        of your priesthood.

018:002 Your brothers also, the tribe of Levi, the tribe of your father,

        bring you near with you, that they may be joined to you,

        and minister to you:  but you and your sons with you shall

        be before the tent of the testimony.

018:003 They shall keep your charge, and the charge of all the Tent:

        only they shall not come near to the vessels of the sanctuary

        and to the altar, that they not die, neither they, nor you.

018:004 They shall be joined to you, and keep the charge of

        the tent of meeting, for all the service of the Tent:

        and a stranger shall not come near to you.

018:005 You shall keep the charge of the sanctuary, and the charge of

        the altar; that there be wrath no more on the children of Israel.

018:006 I, behold, I have taken your brothers the Levites from among

        the children of Israel:  to you they are a gift, given to Yahweh,

        to do the service of the tent of meeting.

018:007 You and your sons with you shall keep your priesthood for

        everything of the altar, and for that within the veil; and you

        shall serve:  I give you the priesthood as a service of gift:

        and the stranger who comes near shall be put to death.

018:008 Yahweh spoke to Aaron, I, behold, I have given you the charge

        of my wave offerings, even all the holy things of the children

        of Israel; to you have I given them by reason of the anointing,

        and to your sons, as a portion forever.

018:009 This shall be your of the most holy things, [reserved] from the fire:

        every offering of theirs, even every meal offering of theirs,

        and every sin offering of theirs, and every trespass offering

        of theirs, which they shall render to me, shall be most holy

        for you and for your sons.

018:010 As the most holy things shall you eat of it; every male shall

        eat of it:  it shall be holy to you.

018:011 This is your:  the wave offering of their gift, even all

        the wave offerings of the children of Israel; I have given

        them to you, and to your sons and to your daughters with you,

        as a portion forever; everyone who is clean in your house

        shall eat of it.

018:012 All the best of the oil, and all the best of the vintage,

        and of the grain, the first fruits of them which they give

        to Yahweh, to you have I given them.

018:013 The first-ripe fruits of all that is in their land, which they

        bring to Yahweh, shall be yours; everyone who is clean in your

        house shall eat of it.

018:014 Everything devoted in Israel shall be yours.

018:015 Everything that opens the womb, of all flesh which they

        offer to Yahweh, both of man and animal shall be yours:

        nevertheless the firstborn of man shall you surely redeem,

        and the firstborn of unclean animals shall you redeem.

018:016 Those who are to be redeemed of them from a month old shall

        you redeem, according to your estimation, for the money

        of five shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary

        (the same is twenty gerahs).

018:017 But the firstborn of a cow, or the firstborn of a sheep,

        or the firstborn of a goat, you shall not redeem; they are holy:

        you shall sprinkle their blood on the altar, and shall

        burn their fat for an offering made by fire, for a sweet

        savor to Yahweh.

018:018 The flesh of them shall be your, as the wave offering breast

        and as the right thigh, it shall be yours.

018:019 All the wave offerings of the holy things, which the children

        of Israel offer to Yahweh, have I given you, and your

        sons and your daughters with you, as a portion forever:

        it is a covenant of salt forever before Yahweh to you and to

        your seed with you.

018:020 Yahweh said to Aaron, You shall have no inheritance in their land,

        neither shall you have any portion among them:  I am your

        portion and your inheritance among the children of Israel.

018:021 To the children of Levi, behold, I have given all the tithe

        in Israel for an inheritance, in return for their service

        which they serve, even the service of the tent of meeting.

018:022 Henceforth the children of Israel shall not come near the tent

        of meeting, lest they bear sin, and die.

018:023 But the Levites shall do the service of the tent of meeting,

        and they shall bear their iniquity:  it shall be a statute

        forever throughout your generations; and among the children

        of Israel they shall have no inheritance.

018:024 For the tithe of the children of Israel, which they offer as a wave

        offering to Yahweh, I have given to the Levites for an inheritance:

        therefore I have said to them, Among the children of Israel

        they shall have no inheritance.

018:025 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

018:026 Moreover you shall speak to the Levites, and tell them,

        When you take of the children of Israel the tithe which I

        have given you from them for your inheritance, then you

        shall offer up a wave offering of it for Yahweh, a tithe

        of the tithe.

018:027 Your wave offering shall be reckoned to you, as though it

        were the grain of the threshing floor, and as the fullness

        of the winepress.

018:028 Thus you also shall offer a wave offering to Yahweh of all

        your tithes, which you receive of the children of Israel;

        and of it you shall give Yahweh's wave offering to Aaron the priest.

018:029 Out of all your gifts you shall offer every wave offering

        of Yahweh, of all the best of it, even the holy part of it

        out of it.

018:030 Therefore you shall tell them, When you heave the best of it

        from it, then it shall be reckoned to the Levites as the increase

        of the threshing floor, and as the increase of the winepress.

018:031 You shall eat it in every place, you and your households:

        for it is your reward in return for your service in the

        tent of meeting.

018:032 You shall bear no sin by reason of it, when you have heaved

        from it the best of it:  and you shall not profane the holy

        things of the children of Israel, that you not die.

019:001 Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,

019:002 This is the statute of the law which Yahweh has commanded,

        saying, Speak to the children of Israel, that they bring

        you a red heifer without spot, in which is no blemish,

        [and] on which never came yoke.

019:003 You shall give her to Eleazar the priest, and he shall bring

        her forth outside of the camp, and one shall kill her

        before his face:

019:004 and Eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his finger,

        and sprinkle her blood toward the front of the tent of

        meeting seven times.

019:005 One shall burn the heifer in his sight; her skin, and her flesh,

        and her blood, with her dung, shall he burn:

019:006 and the priest shall take cedar wood, and hyssop, and scarlet,

        and cast it into the midst of the burning of the heifer.

019:007 Then the priest shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe

        his flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp,

        and the priest shall be unclean until the even.

019:008 He who burns her shall wash his clothes in water, and bathe

        his flesh in water, and shall be unclean until the even.

019:009 A man who is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer,

        and lay them up outside of the camp in a clean place;

        and it shall be kept for the congregation of the children

        of Israel for a water for impurity:  it is a sin offering.

019:010 He who gathers the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes,

        and be unclean until the even:  and it shall be to the children

        of Israel, and to the stranger who lives as a foreigner

        among them, for a statute forever.

019:011 He who touches the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven days:

019:012 the same shall purify himself therewith on the third day,

        and on the seventh day he shall be clean:  but if he doesn't

        purify himself the third day, then the seventh day he shall

        not be clean.

019:013 Whoever touches a dead person, the body of a man who has died,

        and doesn't purify himself, defiles the tent of Yahweh;

        and that soul shall be cut off from Israel:  because the water

        for impurity was not sprinkled on him, he shall be unclean;

        his uncleanness is yet on him.

019:014 This is the law when a man dies in a tent:  everyone who comes

        into the tent, and everyone who is in the tent, shall be

        unclean seven days.

019:015 Every open vessel, which has no covering bound on it, is unclean.

019:016 Whoever in the open field touches one who is slain with a sword,

        or a dead body, or a bone of a man, or a grave, shall be

        unclean seven days.

019:017 For the unclean they shall take of the ashes of the burning

        of the sin offering; and running water shall be put thereto

        in a vessel:

019:018 and a clean person shall take hyssop, and dip it in the water,

        and sprinkle it on the tent, and on all the vessels, and on

        the persons who were there, and on him who touched the bone,

        or the slain, or the dead, or the grave:

019:019 and the clean person shall sprinkle on the unclean on the third day,

        and on the seventh day:  and on the seventh day he shall purify him;

        and he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water,

        and shall be clean at even.

019:020 But the man who shall be unclean, and shall not purify himself,

        that soul shall be cut off from the midst of the assembly,

        because he has defiled the sanctuary of Yahweh:

        the water for impurity has not been sprinkled on him;

        he is unclean.

019:021 It shall be a perpetual statute to them:  and he who sprinkles

        the water for impurity shall wash his clothes, and he who

        touches the water for impurity shall be unclean until even.

019:022 Whatever the unclean person touches shall be unclean;

        and the soul that touches it shall be unclean until even.

020:001 The children of Israel, even the whole congregation,

        came into the wilderness of Zin in the first month:

        and the people abode in Kadesh; and Miriam died there,

        and was buried there.

020:002 There was no water for the congregation:  and they assembled

        themselves together against Moses and against Aaron.

020:003 The people strove with Moses, and spoke, saying, Would that we

        had died when our brothers died before Yahweh!

020:004 Why have you brought the assembly of Yahweh into this wilderness,

        that we should die there, we and our animals?

020:005 Why have you made us to come up out of Egypt, to bring us

        in to this evil place? it is no place of seed, or of figs,

        or of vines, or of pomegranates; neither is there any

        water to drink.

020:006 Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly to

        the door of the tent of meeting, and fell on their faces:

        and the glory of Yahweh appeared to them.

020:007 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

020:008 Take the rod, and assemble the congregation, you, and Aaron

        your brother, and speak you to the rock before their eyes,

        that it give forth its water; and you shall bring forth to them

        water out of the rock; so you shall give the congregation

        and their livestock drink.

020:009 Moses took the rod from before Yahweh, as he commanded him.

020:010 Moses and Aaron gathered the assembly together before the rock,

        and he said to them, Hear now, you rebels; shall we bring

        you forth water out of this rock?

020:011 Moses lifted up his hand, and struck the rock with his rod twice:

        and water came forth abundantly, and the congregation drank,

        and their livestock.

020:012 Yahweh said to Moses and Aaron, Because you didn't believe

        in me, to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel,

        therefore you shall not bring this assembly into the land

        which I have given them.

020:013 These are the waters of Meribah; because the children of Israel

        strove with Yahweh, and he was sanctified in them.

020:014 Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom, Thus says

        your brother Israel, You know all the travail that has

        happened to us:

020:015 how our fathers went down into Egypt, and we lived in

        Egypt a long time; and the Egyptians dealt ill with us,

        and our fathers:

020:016 and when we cried to Yahweh, he heard our voice, and sent

        an angel, and brought us forth out of Egypt:  and behold,

        we are in Kadesh, a city in the uttermost of your border.

020:017 Please let us pass through your land:  we will not pass

        through field or through vineyard, neither will we drink of

        the water of the wells:  we will go along the king's highway;

        we will not turn aside to the right hand nor to the left,

        until we have passed your border.

020:018 Edom said to him, You shall not pass through me, lest I come

        out with the sword against you.

020:019 The children of Israel said to him, We will go up by the highway;

        and if we drink of your water, I and my livestock, then will I give

        the price of it:  let me only, without [doing] anything [else],

        pass through on my feet.

020:020 He said, You shall not pass through.  Edom came out against him

        with much people, and with a strong hand.

020:021 Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border:

        why Israel turned away from him.

020:022 They traveled from Kadesh:  and the children of Israel,

        even the whole congregation, came to Mount Hor.

020:023 Yahweh spoke to Moses and Aaron in Mount Hor, by the border

        of the land of Edom, saying,

020:024 Aaron shall be gathered to his people; for he shall not enter

        into the land which I have given to the children of Israel,

        because you rebelled against my word at the waters of Meribah.

020:025 Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up to Mount Hor;

020:026 and strip Aaron of his garments, and put them on Eleazar his son:

        and Aaron shall be gathered [to his people], and shall die there.

020:027 Moses did as Yahweh commanded:  and they went up into Mount Hor

        in the sight of all the congregation.

020:028 Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and put them on Eleazar

        his son; and Aaron died there on the top of the mountain:

        and Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain.

020:029 When all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, they wept

        for Aaron thirty days, even all the house of Israel.

021:001 The Canaanite, the king of Arad, who lived in the South,

        heard tell that Israel came by the way of Atharim;

        and he fought against Israel, and took some of them captive.

021:002 Israel vowed a vow to Yahweh, and said, If you will indeed

        deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly

        destroy their cities.

021:003 Yahweh listened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up

        the Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities:

        and the name of the place was called Hormah.

021:004 They traveled from Mount Hor by the way to the Red Sea{or, Sea

        of Reeds}, to compass the land of Edom:  and the soul

        of the people was much discouraged because of the way.

021:005 The people spoke against God, and against Moses, Why have you

        brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? for there

        is no bread, and there is no water; and our soul loathes

        this light bread.

021:006 Yahweh sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people;

        and much people of Israel died.

021:007 The people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned,

        because we have spoken against Yahweh, and against you;

        pray to Yahweh, that he take away the serpents from us.

        Moses prayed for the people.

021:008 Yahweh said to Moses, Make you a fiery serpent, and set it on

        a standard:  and it shall happen, that everyone who is bitten,

        when he sees it, shall live.

021:009 Moses made a serpent of brass, and set it on the standard:

        and it happened, that if a serpent had bitten any man,

        when he looked to the serpent of brass, he lived.

021:010 The children of Israel traveled, and encamped in Oboth.

021:011 They traveled from Oboth, and encamped at Iyeabarim,

        in the wilderness which is before Moab, toward the sunrise.

021:012 From there they traveled, and encamped in the valley of Zered.

021:013 From there they traveled, and encamped on the other side

        of the Arnon, which is in the wilderness, that comes out of

        the border of the Amorites:  for the Arnon is the border of Moab,

        between Moab and the Amorites.

021:014 Therefore it is said in the book of the Wars of Yahweh, "Vaheb

        in Suphah, the valleys of the Arnon,

021:015 the slope of the valleys that incline toward the dwelling of Ar,

        leans on the border of Moab."

021:016 From there they traveled to Beer:  that is the well of

        which Yahweh said to Moses, Gather the people together,

        and I will give them water.

021:017 Then sang Israel this song:  "Spring up, well; sing to it:

021:018 the well, which the princes dug, which the nobles of

        the people dug, with the scepter, and with their poles."

        From the wilderness [they traveled] to Mattanah;

021:019 and from Mattanah to Nahaliel; and from Nahaliel to Bamoth;

021:020 and from Bamoth to the valley that is in the field of Moab,

        to the top of Pisgah, which looks down on the desert.

021:021 Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, saying,

021:022 Let me pass through your land:  we will not turn aside into field,

        or into vineyard; we will not drink of the water of the wells:

        we will go by the king's highway, until we have passed your border.

021:023 Sihon would not allow Israel to pass through his border:

        but Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out

        against Israel into the wilderness, and came to Jahaz;

        and he fought against Israel.

021:024 Israel struck him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his

        land from the Arnon to the Jabbok, even to the children of Ammon;

        for the border of the children of Ammon was strong.

021:025 Israel took all these cities:  and Israel lived in all the cities

        of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all the towns of it.

021:026 For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites,

        who had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken

        all his land out of his hand, even to the Arnon.

021:027 Therefore those who speak in proverbs say, "Come to Heshbon.

        Let the city of Sihon be built and established;

021:028 for a fire has gone out of Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon.

        It has devoured Ar of Moab, The lords of the high places

        of the Arnon.

021:029 Woe to you, Moab!  You are undone, people of Chemosh!  He has

        given his sons as fugitives, and his daughters into captivity,

        to Sihon king of the Amorites.

021:030 We have shot at them.  Heshbon has perished even to Dibon.

        We have laid waste even to Nophah, Which reaches to Medeba."

021:031 Thus Israel lived in the land of the Amorites.

021:032 Moses sent to spy out Jazer; and they took the towns of it,

        and drove out the Amorites who were there.

021:033 They turned and went up by the way of Bashan:  and Og the king

        of Bashan went out against them, he and all his people,

        to battle at Edrei.

021:034 Yahweh said to Moses, Don't fear him:  for I have delivered

        him into your hand, and all his people, and his land;

        and you shall do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites,

        who lived at Heshbon.

021:035 So they struck him, and his sons and all his people, until there

        was none left him remaining:  and they possessed his land.

022:001 The children of Israel traveled, and encamped in the plains

        of Moab beyond the Jordan at Jericho.

022:002 Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done

        to the Amorites.

022:003 Moab was sore afraid of the people, because they were many:

        and Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel.

022:004 Moab said to the elders of Midian, Now will this multitude lick

        up all that is round about us, as the ox licks up the grass

        of the field.  Balak the son of Zippor was king of Moab

        at that time.

022:005 He sent messengers to Balaam the son of Beor, to Pethor,

        which is by the River, to the land of the children of his people,

        to call him, saying, Behold, there is a people come out

        from Egypt:  behold, they cover the surface of the earth,

        and they abide over against me.

022:006 Please come now therefore curse me this people; for they are

        too mighty for me:  peradventure I shall prevail, that we

        may strike them, and that I may drive them out of the land;

        for I know that he whom you bless is blessed, and he whom

        you curse is cursed.

022:007 The elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the

        rewards of divination in their hand; and they came to Balaam,

        and spoke to him the words of Balak.

022:008 He said to them, Lodge here this night, and I will bring you

        word again, as Yahweh shall speak to me:  and the princes

        of Moab abode with Balaam.

022:009 God came to Balaam, and said, What men are these with you?

022:010 Balaam said to God, Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab,

        has sent to me, [saying],

022:011 Behold, the people that is come out of Egypt, it covers

        the surface of the earth:  now, come curse me them;

        peradventure I shall be able to fight against them, and shall

        drive them out.

022:012 God said to Balaam, You shall not go with them; you shall

        not curse the people; for they are blessed.

022:013 Balaam rose up in the morning, and said to the princes

        of Balak, Get you into your land; for Yahweh refuses to give

        me leave to go with you.

022:014 The princes of Moab rose up, and they went to Balak, and said,

        Balaam refuses to come with us.

022:015 Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honorable than they.

022:016 They came to Balaam, and said to him, Thus says Balak the son

        of Zippor, Please let nothing hinder you from coming to me:

022:017 for I will promote you to very great honor, and whatever you

        say to me I will do.  Please come therefore, and curse this

        people for me.

022:018 Balaam answered the servants of Balak, If Balak would give me

        his house full of silver and gold, I can't go beyond the word

        of Yahweh my God, to do less or more.

022:019 Now therefore, please wait also here this night, that I may

        know what Yahweh will speak to me more.

022:020 God came to Balaam at night, and said to him, If the men are

        come to call you, rise up, go with them; but only the word

        which I speak to you, that shall you do.

022:021 Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his donkey,

        and went with the princes of Moab.

022:022 God's anger was kindled because he went; and the angel of Yahweh

        placed himself in the way for an adversary against him.

        Now he was riding on his donkey, and his two servants

        were with him.

022:023 The donkey saw the angel of Yahweh standing in the way,

        with his sword drawn in his hand; and the donkey

        turned aside out of the way, and went into the field:

        and Balaam struck the donkey, to turn her into the way.

022:024 Then the angel of Yahweh stood in a narrow path between the vineyards,

        a wall being on this side, and a wall on that side.

022:025 The donkey saw the angel of Yahweh, and she thrust herself

        to the wall, and crushed Balaam's foot against the wall:

        and he struck her again.

022:026 The angel of Yahweh went further, and stood in a narrow place,

        where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left.

022:027 The donkey saw the angel of Yahweh, and she lay down under Balaam:

        and Balaam's anger was kindled, and he struck the donkey

        with his staff.

022:028 Yahweh opened the mouth of the donkey, and she said

        to Balaam, What have I done to you, that you have struck me

        these three times?

022:029 Balaam said to the donkey, Because you have mocked me, I would

        there were a sword in my hand, for now I had killed you.

022:030 The donkey said to Balaam, Am I not your donkey, on which you

        have ridden all your life long to this day? was I ever wont

        to do so to you? and he said, No.

022:031 Then Yahweh opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel

        of Yahweh standing in the way, with his sword drawn in his hand;

        and he bowed his head, and fell on his face.

022:032 The angel of Yahweh said to him, Why have you struck your donkey

        these three times? behold, I am come forth for an adversary,

        because your way is perverse before me:

022:033 and the donkey saw me, and turned aside before me these three times:

        unless she had turned aside from me, surely now I had even

        slain you, and saved her alive.

022:034 Balaam said to the angel of Yahweh, I have sinned;

        for I didn't know that you stood in the way against me:

        now therefore, if it displease you, I will get me back again.

022:035 The angel of Yahweh said to Balaam, Go with the men; but only

        the word that I shall speak to you, that you shall speak.

        So Balaam went with the princes of Balak.

022:036 When Balak heard that Balaam was come, he went out to meet him

        to the City of Moab, which is on the border of the Arnon,

        which is in the utmost part of the border.

022:037 Balak said to Balaam, Didn't I earnestly send to you to call

        you? why didn't you come to me? am I not able indeed to promote

        you to honor?

022:038 Balaam said to Balak, Behold, I have come to you:

        have I now any power at all to speak anything? the word

        that God puts in my mouth, that shall I speak.

022:039 Balaam went with Balak, and they came to Kiriath Huzoth.

022:040 Balak sacrificed oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam,

        and to the princes who were with him.

022:041 It happened in the morning, that Balak took Balaam, and brought

        him up into the high places of Baal; and he saw from there

        the utmost part of the people.

023:001 Balaam said to Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare

        me here seven bulls and seven rams.

023:002 Balak did as Balaam had spoken; and Balak and Balaam offered

        on every altar a bull and a ram.

023:003 Balaam said to Balak, Stand by your burnt offering, and I will go:

        perhaps Yahweh will come to meet me; and whatever he shows

        me I will tell you.  He went to a bare height.

023:004 God met Balaam:  and he said to him, I have prepared the seven altars,

        and I have offered up a bull and a ram on every altar.

023:005 Yahweh put a word in Balaam's mouth, and said, Return to Balak,

        and thus you shall speak.

023:006 He returned to him, and behold, he was standing by his

        burnt offering, he, and all the princes of Moab.

023:007 He took up his parable, and said, From Aram has Balak brought me,

        The king of Moab from the mountains of the East:  Come, curse

        me Jacob, Come, defy Israel.

023:008 How shall I curse, whom God has not cursed?  How shall I defy,

        whom Yahweh has not defied?

023:009 For from the top of the rocks I see him, From the hills I see him:

        behold, it is a people that dwells alone, And shall not be

        reckoned among the nations.

023:010 Who can count the dust of Jacob, Or number the fourth

        part of Israel?  Let me die the death of the righteous,

        Let my last end be like his!

023:011 Balak said to Balaam, What have you done to me?

        I took you to curse my enemies, and behold, you have

        blessed them altogether.

023:012 He answered and said, Must I not take heed to speak that which

        Yahweh puts in my mouth?

023:013 Balak said to him, Please come with me to another place,

        from whence you may see them; you shall see but the utmost

        part of them, and shall not see them all:  and curse me

        them from there.

023:014 He took him into the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah,

        and built seven altars, and offered up a bull and a ram

        on every altar.

023:015 He said to Balak, Stand here by your burnt offering, while I

        meet [Yahweh] yonder.

023:016 Yahweh met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and said,

        Return to Balak, and thus shall you speak.

023:017 He came to him, and behold, he was standing by his burnt offering,

        and the princes of Moab with him.  Balak said to him,

        What has Yahweh spoken?

023:018 He took up his parable, and said, Rise up, Balak, and hear!

        Listen to me, you son of Zippor.

023:019 God is not a man, that he should lie, nor the son of man,

        that he should repent.  Has he said, and will he not do it?

        Or has he spoken, and will he not make it good?

023:020 Behold, I have received a command to bless.  He has blessed,

        and I can't reverse it.

023:021 He has not seen iniquity in Jacob.  Neither has he seen

        perverseness in Israel.  Yahweh his God is with him.

        The shout of a king is among them.

023:022 God brings them out of Egypt.  He has as it were the strength

        of the wild ox.

023:023 Surely there is no enchantment with Jacob; Neither is there

        any divination with Israel.  Now it shall be said of Jacob

        and of Israel, What has God done!

023:024 Behold, the people rises up as a lioness, As a lion he lifts

        himself up.  He shall not lie down until he eat of the prey,

        and drinks the blood of the slain.

023:025 Balak said to Balaam, Neither curse them at all, nor bless

        them at all.

023:026 But Balaam answered Balak, Didn't I tell you, saying, All that

        Yahweh speaks, that I must do?

023:027 Balak said to Balaam, Come now, I will take you to another place;

        peradventure it will please God that you may curse me

        them from there.

023:028 Balak took Balaam to the top of Peor, that looks down

        on the desert.

023:029 Balaam said to Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare

        me here seven bulls and seven rams.

023:030 Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered up a bull and a ram

        on every altar.

024:001 When Balaam saw that it pleased Yahweh to bless Israel,

        he didn't go, as at the other times, to meet with enchantments,

        but he set his face toward the wilderness.

024:002 Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel dwelling according

        to their tribes; and the Spirit of God came on him.

024:003 He took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor says,

        the man whose eye was closed says;

024:004 he says, who hears the words of God, who sees the vision

        of the Almighty, falling down, and having his eyes open:

024:005 How goodly are your tents, Jacob, and your tents, Israel!

024:006 As valleys they are spread forth, as gardens by the riverside,

        as aloes which Yahweh has planted, as cedar trees beside the waters.

024:007 Water shall flow from his buckets.  His seed shall be

        in many waters.  His king shall be higher than Agag.

        His kingdom shall be exalted.

024:008 God brings him out of Egypt.  He has as it were the strength

        of the wild ox.  He shall eat up the nations his adversaries,

        shall break their bones in pieces, and pierce them with his arrows.

024:009 He couched, he lay down as a lion, as a lioness; who shall

        rouse him up?  Everyone who blesses you is blessed.

        Everyone who curses you is cursed.

024:010 Balak's anger was kindled against Balaam, and he struck

        his hands together; and Balak said to Balaam, I called you

        to curse my enemies, and, behold, you have altogether blessed

        them these three times.

024:011 Therefore now flee you to your place:  I thought to promote

        you to great honor; but, behold, Yahweh has kept you

        back from honor.

024:012 Balaam said to Balak, Didn't I also tell your messengers

        who you sent to me, saying,

024:013 If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold,

        I can't go beyond the word of Yahweh, to do either good or bad

        of my own mind; what Yahweh speaks, that will I speak?

024:014 Now, behold, I go to my people:  come, [and] I will advertise you

        what this people shall do to your people in the latter days.

024:015 He took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor says,

        the man whose eye was closed says;

024:016 he says, who hears the words of God, knows the knowledge of the

        Most High, and who sees the vision of the Almighty, Falling down,

        and having his eyes open:

024:017 I see him, but not now.  I see him, but not near.

        A star will come out of Jacob.  A scepter will rise out

        of Israel, and shall strike through the corners of Moab,

        and break down all the sons of Sheth.

024:018 Edom shall be a possession.  Seir, his enemies, also shall

        be a possession, while Israel does valiantly.

024:019 Out of Jacob shall one have dominion, and shall destroy

        the remnant from the city.

024:020 He looked at Amalek, and took up his parable, and said,

        Amalek was the first of the nations, But his latter end shall

        come to destruction.

024:021 He looked at the Kenite, and took up his parable, and said,

        Your dwelling place is strong.  Your nest is set in the rock.

024:022 Nevertheless Kain shall be wasted, until Asshur carries

        you away captive.

024:023 He took up his parable, and said, Alas, who shall live when

        God does this?

024:024 But ships [shall come] from the coast of Kittim.

        They shall afflict Asshur, and shall afflict Eber.

        He also shall come to destruction.

024:025 Balaam rose up, and went and returned to his place; and Balak

        also went his way.

025:001 Israel abode in Shittim; and the people began to play

        the prostitute with the daughters of Moab:

025:002 for they called the people to the sacrifices of their gods;

        and the people ate, and bowed down to their gods.

025:003 Israel joined himself to Baal Peor:  and the anger of Yahweh

        was kindled against Israel.

025:004 Yahweh said to Moses, Take all the chiefs of the people,

        and hang them up to Yahweh before the sun, that the fierce

        anger of Yahweh may turn away from Israel.

025:005 Moses said to the judges of Israel, Kill you everyone his men

        who have joined themselves to Baal Peor.

025:006 Behold, one of the children of Israel came and brought to his

        brothers a Midianite woman in the sight of Moses, and in

        the sight of all the congregation of the children of Israel,

        while they were weeping at the door of the tent of meeting.

025:007 When Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest,

        saw it, he rose up from the midst of the congregation,

        and took a spear in his hand;

025:008 and he went after the man of Israel into the pavilion,

        and thrust both of them through, the man of Israel,

        and the woman through her body.  So the plague was stayed

        from the children of Israel.

025:009 Those who died by the plague were twenty-four thousand.

025:010 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

025:011 Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest,

        has turned my wrath away from the children of Israel,

        in that he was jealous with my jealousy among them, so that I

        didn't consume the children of Israel in my jealousy.

025:012 Therefore say, Behold, I give to him my covenant of peace:

025:013 and it shall be to him, and to his seed after him, the covenant

        of an everlasting priesthood; because he was jealous for his God,

        and made atonement for the children of Israel.

025:014 Now the name of the man of Israel that was slain, who was

        slain with the Midianite woman, was Zimri, the son of Salu,

        a prince of a fathers' house among the Simeonites.

025:015 The name of the Midianite woman who was slain was Cozbi,

        the daughter of Zur; he was head of the people of a fathers'

        house in Midian.

025:016 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

025:017 Vex the Midianites, and strike them;

025:018 for they vex you with their wiles, with which they have deceived

        you in the matter of Peor, and in the matter of Cozbi,

        the daughter of the prince of Midian, their sister, who was

        slain on the day of the plague in the matter of Peor.

026:001 It happened after the plague, that Yahweh spoke to Moses

        and to Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, saying,

026:002 Take the sum of all the congregation of the children of Israel,

        from twenty years old and upward, by their fathers'

        houses, all who are able to go forth to war in Israel.

026:003 Moses and Eleazar the priest spoke with them in the plains

        of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho, saying,

026:004 [Take the sum of the people], from twenty years old and upward;

        as Yahweh commanded Moses and the children of Israel,

        that came forth out of the land of Egypt.

026:005 Reuben, the firstborn of Israel; the sons of Reuben:

        [of] Hanoch, the family of the Hanochites; of Pallu,

        the family of the Palluites;

026:006 of Hezron, the family of the Hezronites; of Carmi, the family

        of the Carmites.

026:007 These are the families of the Reubenites; and those who were

        numbered of them were forty-three thousand seven hundred thirty.

026:008 The sons of Pallu:  Eliab.

026:009 The sons of Eliab:  Nemuel, and Dathan, and Abiram.  These are

        that Dathan and Abiram, who were called of the congregation,

        who strove against Moses and against Aaron in the company

        of Korah, when they strove against Yahweh,

026:010 and the earth opened its mouth, and swallowed them up together

        with Korah, when that company died; what time the fire devoured

        two hundred fifty men, and they became a sign.

026:011 Notwithstanding, the sons of Korah didn't die.

026:051 These are those who were numbered of the children of Israel,

026:052 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

026:053 To these the land shall be divided for an inheritance according

        to the number of names.

026:054 To the more you shall give the more inheritance,

        and to the fewer you shall give the less inheritance:

        to everyone according to those who were numbered of him shall

        his inheritance be given.

026:055 Notwithstanding, the land shall be divided by lot:

        according to the names of the tribes of their fathers

        they shall inherit.

026:056 According to the lot shall their inheritance be divided between

        the more and the fewer.

026:057 These are those who were numbered of the Levites after

        their families:  of Gershon, the family of the Gershonites;

        of Kohath, the family of the Kohathites; of Merari, the family

026:058 These are the families of Levi:  the family of the Libnites,

        the family of the Hebronites, the family of the Mahlites,

        the family of the Mushites, the family of the Korahites.

        Kohath became the father of Amram.

026:059 The name of Amram's wife was Jochebed, the daughter of Levi,

        who was born to Levi in Egypt:  and she bore to Amram Aaron

        and Moses, and Miriam their sister.

026:060 To Aaron were born Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.

026:061 Nadab and Abihu died, when they offered strange fire before Yahweh.

026:062 Those who were numbered of them were twenty-three thousand,

        every male from a month old and upward:  for they were not

        numbered among the children of Israel, because there was no

        inheritance given them among the children of Israel.

026:063 These are those who were numbered by Moses and Eleazar the priest,

        who numbered the children of Israel in the plains of Moab

        by the Jordan at Jericho.

026:064 But among these there was not a man of them who were numbered

        by Moses and Aaron the priest, who numbered the children

        of Israel in the wilderness of Sinai.

026:065 For Yahweh had said of them, They shall surely die in the wilderness.

        There was not left a man of them, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh,

        and Joshua the son of Nun.

027:001 Then drew near the daughters of Zelophehad, the son of Hepher,

        the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh,

        of the families of Manasseh the son of Joseph; and these

        are the names of his daughters:  Mahlah, Noah, and Hoglah,

        and Milcah, and Tirzah.

027:002 They stood before Moses, and before Eleazar the priest,

        and before the princes and all the congregation, at the door

        of the tent of meeting, saying,

027:003 Our father died in the wilderness, and he was not among

        the company of those who gathered themselves together against

        Yahweh in the company of Korah:  but he died in his own sin;

        and he had no sons.

027:004 Why should the name of our father be taken away from among

        his family, because he had no son?  Give to us a possession

        among the brothers of our father.

027:005 Moses brought their cause before Yahweh.

027:006 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

027:007 The daughters of Zelophehad speak right:  you shall surely give

        them a possession of an inheritance among their father's brothers;

        and you shall cause the inheritance of their father to

        pass to them.

027:008 You shall speak to the children of Israel, saying, If a man die,

        and have no son, then you shall cause his inheritance to pass

        to his daughter.

027:009 If he have no daughter, then you shall give his inheritance

        to his brothers.

027:010 If he have no brothers, then you shall give his inheritance

        to his father's brothers.

027:011 If his father have no brothers, then you shall give his

        inheritance to his kinsman who is next to him of his family,

        and he shall possess it:  and it shall be to the children

        of Israel a statute [and] ordinance, as Yahweh commanded Moses.

027:012 Yahweh said to Moses, Go up into this mountain of Abarim,

        and see the land which I have given to the children of Israel.

027:013 When you have seen it, you also shall be gathered to your people,

        as Aaron your brother was gathered;

027:014 because you rebelled against my word in the wilderness of Zin,

        in the strife of the congregation, to sanctify me at the waters

        before their eyes.  (These are the waters of Meribah of Kadesh

        in the wilderness of Zin.)

027:015 Moses spoke to Yahweh, saying,

027:016 Let Yahweh, the God of the spirits of all flesh, appoint a man

        over the congregation,

027:017 who may go out before them, and who may come in before them,

        and who may lead them out, and who may bring them in;

        that the congregation of Yahweh not be as sheep which

        have no shepherd.

027:018 Yahweh said to Moses, Take Joshua the son of Nun, a man in whom

        is the Spirit, and lay your hand on him;

027:019 and set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all

        the congregation; and give him a charge in their sight.

027:020 You shall put of your honor on him, that all the congregation

        of the children of Israel may obey.

027:021 He shall stand before Eleazar the priest, who shall inquire

        for him by the judgment of the Urim before Yahweh:

        at his word shall they go out, and at his word they shall

        come in, both he, and all the children of Israel with him,

        even all the congregation.

027:022 Moses did as Yahweh commanded him; and he took Joshua, and set

        him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the congregation:

027:023 and he laid his hands on him, and gave him a charge, as Yahweh

        spoke by Moses.

028:001 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

028:002 Command the children of Israel, and tell them, My offering,

        my food for my offerings made by fire, of a sweet savor to me,

        shall you observe to offer to me in their due season.

028:003 You shall tell them, This is the offering made by fire which you

        shall offer to Yahweh:  male lambs a year old without blemish,

        two day by day, for a continual burnt offering.

028:004 The one lamb shall you offer in the morning, and the other lamb

        shall you offer at even;

028:005 and the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a meal offering,

        mixed with the fourth part of a hin of beaten oil.

028:006 It is a continual burnt offering, which was ordained in Mount Sinai

        for a sweet savor, an offering made by fire to Yahweh.

028:007 The drink offering of it shall be the fourth part of a hin

        for the one lamb:  in the holy place shall you pour out a drink

        offering of strong drink to Yahweh.

028:008 The other lamb shall you offer at even:  as the meal offering

        of the morning, and as the drink offering of it, you shall

        offer it, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor to Yahweh.

028:009 On the Sabbath day two male lambs a year old without blemish,

        and two tenth parts [of an ephah] of fine flour for a meal offering,

        mixed with oil, and the drink offering of it:

028:010 this is the burnt offering of every Sabbath, besides the continual

        burnt offering, and the drink offering of it.

028:011 In the beginnings of your months you shall offer a burnt

        offering to Yahweh:  two young bulls, and one ram, seven male

        lambs a year old without blemish;

028:012 and three tenth parts [of an ephah] of fine flour for a

        meal offering, mixed with oil, for each bull; and two tenth

        parts of fine flour for a meal offering, mixed with oil,

        for the one ram;

028:013 and a tenth part of fine flour mixed with oil for a meal

        offering to every lamb; for a burnt offering of a sweet savor,

        an offering made by fire to Yahweh.

028:014 Their drink offerings shall be half a hin of wine for a bull,

        and the third part of a hin for the ram, and the fourth part

        of a hin for a lamb:  this is the burnt offering of every

        month throughout the months of the year.

028:015 One male goat for a sin offering to Yahweh; it shall be

        offered besides the continual burnt offering, and the drink

        offering of it.

028:016 In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month,

        is Yahweh's Passover.

028:017 On the fifteenth day of this month shall be a feast:

        seven days shall unleavened bread be eaten.

028:018 In the first day shall be a holy convocation:  you shall

        do no servile work;

028:019 but you shall offer an offering made by fire, a burnt offering

        to Yahweh:  two young bulls, and one ram, and seven male

        lambs a year old; they shall be to you without blemish;

028:020 and their meal offering, fine flour mixed with oil:

        three tenth parts shall you offer for a bull, and two tenth

        parts for the ram;

028:021 a tenth part shall you offer for every lamb of the seven lambs;

028:022 and one male goat for a sin offering, to make atonement for you.

028:023 You shall offer these besides the burnt offering of the morning,

        which is for a continual burnt offering.

028:024 After this manner you shall offer daily, for seven days, the food

        of the offering made by fire, of a sweet savor to Yahweh:

        it shall be offered besides the continual burnt offering,

        and the drink offering of it.

028:025 On the seventh day you shall have a holy convocation:

        you shall do no servile work.

028:026 Also in the day of the first fruits, when you offer a new meal

        offering to Yahweh in your [feast of] weeks, you shall have

        a holy convocation; you shall do no servile work;

028:027 but you shall offer a burnt offering for a sweet savor to Yahweh:

        two young bulls, one ram, seven male lambs a year old;

028:028 and their meal offering, fine flour mixed with oil, three tenth

        parts for each bull, two tenth parts for the one ram,

028:029 a tenth part for every lamb of the seven lambs;

028:030 one male goat, to make atonement for you.

028:031 Besides the continual burnt offering, and the meal offering of it,

        you shall offer them (they shall be to you without blemish),

        and their drink offerings.

029:001 In the seventh month, on the first day of the month, you shall

        have a holy convocation; you shall do no servile work:

        it is a day of blowing of trumpets to you.

029:002 You shall offer a burnt offering for a sweet savor to Yahweh:

        one young bull, one ram, seven male lambs a year old without blemish;

029:003 and their meal offering, fine flour mixed with oil, three tenth

        parts for the bull, two tenth parts for the ram,

029:004 and one tenth part for every lamb of the seven lambs;

029:005 and one male goat for a sin offering, to make atonement for you;

029:006 besides the burnt offering of the new moon, and the meal offering

        of it, and the continual burnt offering and the meal offering

        of it, and their drink offerings, according to their ordinance,

        for a sweet savor, an offering made by fire to Yahweh.

029:007 On the tenth day of this seventh month you shall have

        a holy convocation; and you shall afflict your souls:

        you shall do no manner of work;

029:008 but you shall offer a burnt offering to Yahweh for a sweet savor:

        one young bull, one ram, seven male lambs a year old;

        they shall be to you without blemish;

029:009 and their meal offering, fine flour mixed with oil, three tenth

        parts for the bull, two tenth parts for the one ram,

029:010 a tenth part for every lamb of the seven lambs:

029:011 one male goat for a sin offering; besides the sin offering

        of atonement, and the continual burnt offering, and the meal

        offering of it, and their drink offerings.

029:012 On the fifteenth day of the seventh month you shall have

        a holy convocation; you shall do no servile work, and you

        shall keep a feast to Yahweh seven days:

029:013 and you shall offer a burnt offering, an offering made by fire,

        of a sweet savor to Yahweh; thirteen young bulls, two rams,

        fourteen male lambs a year old; they shall be without blemish;

029:014 and their meal offering, fine flour mixed with oil,

        three tenth parts for every bull of the thirteen bulls,

        two tenth parts for each ram of the two rams,

029:015 and a tenth part for every lamb of the fourteen lambs;

029:016 and one male goat for a sin offering, besides the continual

        burnt offering, the meal offering of it, and the drink

        offering of it.

029:017 On the second day [you shall offer] twelve young bulls,

        two rams, fourteen male lambs a year old without blemish;

029:018 and their meal offering and their drink offerings for the bulls,

        for the rams, and for the lambs, according to their number,

        after the ordinance;

        after the ordinance;

029:022 and one male goat for a sin offering; besides the continual

        after the ordinance;

029:029 On the sixth day eight bulls, two rams, fourteen male lambs

        after the ordinance;

029:031 and one male goat for a sin offering; besides the continual

        offerings of it.

029:032 On the seventh day seven bulls, two rams, fourteen male lambs

        after the ordinance;

029:034 and one male goat for a sin offering; besides the continual

        burnt offering, the meal offering of it, and the drink

        offering of it.

029:035 On the eighth day you shall have a solemn assembly:

        you shall do no servile work;

029:036 but you shall offer a burnt offering, an offering made by fire,

        of a sweet savor to Yahweh:  one bull, one ram, seven male

        lambs a year old without blemish;

029:037 their meal offering and their drink offerings for the bull,

        for the ram, and for the lambs, shall be according to their number,

        after the ordinance:

029:038 and one male goat for a sin offering, besides the continual

        burnt offering, and the meal offering of it, and the drink

        offering of it.

029:039 These you shall offer to Yahweh in your set feasts, besides your vows,

        and your freewill offerings, for your burnt offerings,

        and for your meal offerings, and for your drink offerings,

        and for your peace offerings.

029:040 Moses told the children of Israel according to all that

        Yahweh commanded Moses.

030:001 Moses spoke to the heads of the tribes of the children of Israel,

        saying, This is the thing which Yahweh has commanded.

030:002 When a man vows a vow to Yahweh, or swears an oath to bind

        his soul with a bond, he shall not break his word; he shall

        do according to all that proceeds out of his mouth.

030:003 Also when a woman vows a vow to Yahweh, and binds herself

        by a bond, being in her father's house, in her youth,

030:004 and her father hears her vow, and her bond with which she

        has bound her soul, and her father holds his peace at her;

        then all her vows shall stand, and every bond with which she

        has bound her soul shall stand.

030:005 But if her father disallow her in the day that he hears,

        none of her vows, or of her bonds with which she has bound

        her soul, shall stand:  and Yahweh will forgive her,

        because her father disallowed her.

030:006 If she be [married] to a husband, while her vows are on her,

        or the rash utterance of her lips, with which she has

        bound her soul,

030:007 and her husband hear it, and hold his peace at her in the day

        that he hears it; then her vows shall stand, and her bonds

        with which she has bound her soul shall stand.

030:008 But if her husband disallow her in the day that he hears it,

        then he shall make void her vow which is on her, and the rash

        utterance of her lips, with which she has bound her soul:

        and Yahweh will forgive her.

030:009 But the vow of a widow, or of her who is divorced,

        [even] everything with which she has bound her soul,

        shall stand against her.

030:010 If she vowed in her husband's house, or bound her soul by a bond

        with an oath,

030:011 and her husband heard it, and held his peace at her,

        and didn't disallow her; then all her vows shall stand,

        and every bond with which she bound her soul shall stand.

030:012 But if her husband made them null and void in the day that he

        heard them, then whatever proceeded out of her lips concerning

        her vows, or concerning the bond of her soul, shall not stand:

        her husband has made them void; and Yahweh will forgive her.

030:013 Every vow, and every binding oath to afflict the soul,

        her husband may establish it, or her husband may make it void.

030:014 But if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day

        to day, then he establishes all her vows, or all her bonds,

        which are on her:  he has established them, because he held

        his peace at her in the day that he heard them.

030:015 But if he shall make them null and void after that he has

        heard them, then he shall bear her iniquity.

030:016 These are the statutes, which Yahweh commanded Moses,

        between a man and his wife, between a father and his daughter,

        being in her youth, in her father's house.

031:001 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

031:002 Avenge the children of Israel of the Midianites:

        afterward you shall be gathered to your people.

031:003 Moses spoke to the people, saying, Arm you men from among you

        for the war, that they may go against Midian, to execute

        Yahweh's vengeance on Midian.

031:004 Of every tribe one thousand, throughout all the tribes of Israel,

        shall you send to the war.

031:005 So there were delivered, out of the thousands of Israel,

        a thousand of every tribe, twelve thousand armed for war.

031:006 Moses sent them, one thousand of every tribe, to the war,

        them and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, to the war,

        with the vessels of the sanctuary and the trumpets for the alarm

        in his hand.

031:007 They warred against Midian, as Yahweh commanded Moses;

        and they killed every male.

031:008 They killed the kings of Midian with the rest of their slain:

        Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, the five

        kings of Midian:  Balaam also the son of Beor they killed

        with the sword.

031:009 The children of Israel took captive the women of Midian and their

        little ones; and all their livestock, and all their flocks,

        and all their goods, they took for a prey.

031:010 All their cities in the places in which they lived, and all

        their encampments, they burnt with fire.

031:011 They took all the spoil, and all the prey, both of man

        and of animal.

031:012 They brought the captives, and the prey, and the spoil,

        to Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and to the congregation

        of the children of Israel, to the camp at the plains of Moab,

        which are by the Jordan at Jericho.

031:013 Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and all the princes of

        the congregation, went forth to meet them outside of the camp.

031:014 Moses was angry with the officers of the army, the captains

        of thousands and the captains of hundreds, who came from

        the service of the war.

031:015 Moses said to them, Have you saved all the women alive?

031:016 Behold, these caused the children of Israel, through the counsel

        of Balaam, to commit trespass against Yahweh in the matter of Peor,

        and so the plague was among the congregation of Yahweh.

031:017 Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill

        every woman who has known man by lying with him.

031:018 But all the girls, who have not known man by lying with him,

        keep alive for yourselves.

031:019 Encamp you outside of the camp seven days:  whoever has

        killed any person, and whoever has touched any slain,

        purify yourselves on the third day and on the seventh day,

        you and your captives.

031:020 As to every garment, and all that is made of skin,

        and all work of goats' [hair], and all things made of wood,

        you shall purify yourselves.

031:021 Eleazar the priest said to the men of war who went to the battle,

        This is the statute of the law which Yahweh has commanded Moses:

031:022 however the gold, and the silver, the brass, the iron, the tin,

        and the lead,

031:023 everything that may abide the fire, you shall make to go

        through the fire, and it shall be clean; nevertheless it

        shall be purified with the water for impurity:

        and all that doesn't withstand the fire you shall make to go

        through the water.

031:024 You shall wash your clothes on the seventh day, and you shall

        be clean; and afterward you shall come into the camp.

031:025 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

031:026 Take the sum of the prey that was taken, both of man and of animal,

        you, and Eleazar the priest, and the heads of the fathers'

        [houses] of the congregation;

031:027 and divide the prey into two parts:  between the men skilled

        in war, who went out to battle, and all the congregation.

031:028 Levy a tribute to Yahweh of the men of war who went out to battle:

        one soul of five hundred, [both] of the persons, and of the oxen,

        and of the donkeys, and of the flocks:

031:029 take it of their half, and give it to Eleazar the priest,

        for Yahweh's wave offering.

031:030 Of the children of Israel's half, you shall take one drawn out

        of every fifty, of the persons, of the oxen, of the donkeys,

        and of the flocks, [even] of all the livestock, and give them

        to the Levites, who keep the charge of the tent of Yahweh.

031:031 Moses and Eleazar the priest did as Yahweh commanded Moses.

031:032 Now the prey, over and above the booty which the men of war took,

        was six hundred seventy-five thousand sheep,

031:033 and seventy-two thousand oxen,

031:034 and sixty-one thousand donkeys,

031:035 and thirty-two thousand persons in all, of the women who had

        not known man by lying with him.

031:036 The half, which was the portion of those who went out to war,

        was in number three hundred thirty-seven thousand

        five hundred sheep:

031:037 and Yahweh's tribute of the sheep was six hundred seventy-five.

031:038 The oxen were thirty-six thousand; of which Yahweh's

        tribute was seventy-two.

031:039 The donkeys were thirty thousand five hundred; of which Yahweh's

        tribute was sixty-one.

031:040 The persons were sixteen thousand; of whom Yahweh's tribute

        was thirty-two persons.

031:041 Moses gave the tribute, which was Yahweh's wave offering,

        to Eleazar the priest, as Yahweh commanded Moses.

031:042 Of the children of Israel's half, which Moses divided off

        from the men who warred

031:043 (now the congregation's half was three hundred thirty-seven

        thousand five hundred sheep,

031:044 and thirty-six thousand oxen,

031:045 and thirty thousand five hundred donkeys,

031:046 and sixteen thousand persons),

031:047 even of the children of Israel's half, Moses took one drawn

        out of every fifty, both of man and of animal, and gave them

        to the Levites, who kept the charge of the tent of Yahweh;

        as Yahweh commanded Moses.

031:048 The officers who were over the thousands of the army,

        the captains of thousands, and the captains of hundreds,

        came near to Moses;

031:049 and they said to Moses, Your servants have taken the sum

        of the men of war who are under our charge, and there lacks

        not one man of us.

031:050 We have brought Yahweh's offering, what every man has gotten,

        of jewels of gold, armlets, and bracelets, signet rings, earrings,

        and necklaces, to make atonement for our souls before Yahweh.

031:051 Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of them,

        even all worked jewels.

031:052 All the gold of the wave offering that they offered up to Yahweh,

        of the captains of thousands, and of the captains of hundreds,

        was sixteen thousand seven hundred fifty shekels.

031:053 ([For] the men of war had taken booty, every man for himself.)

031:054 Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains of

        thousands and of hundreds, and brought it into the tent of meeting,

        for a memorial for the children of Israel before Yahweh.

032:001 Now the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had

        a very great multitude of livestock:  and when they saw

        the land of Jazer, and the land of Gilead, that behold,

        the place was a place for livestock;

032:002 the children of Gad and the children of Reuben came and spoke

        to Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and to the princes

        of the congregation, saying,

032:003 Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and Nimrah, and Heshbon,

        and Elealeh, and Sebam, and Nebo, and Beon,

032:004 the land which Yahweh struck before the congregation of Israel,

        is a land for livestock; and your servants have livestock.

032:005 They said, If we have found favor in your sight, let this land

        be given to your servants for a possession; don't bring us

        over the Jordan.

032:006 Moses said to the children of Gad, and to the children

        of Reuben, Shall your brothers go to the war, and shall

        you sit here?

032:007 Why discourage you the heart of the children of Israel from

        going over into the land which Yahweh has given them?

032:008 Thus did your fathers, when I sent them from Kadesh Barnea

        to see the land.

032:009 For when they went up to the valley of Eshcol, and saw the land,

        they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel, that they

        should not go into the land which Yahweh had given them.

032:010 Yahweh's anger was kindled in that day, and he swore, saying,

032:011 Surely none of the men who came up out of Egypt, from twenty years

        old and upward, shall see the land which I swore to Abraham,

        to Isaac, and to Jacob; because they have not wholly followed me:

032:012 save Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite, and Joshua

        the son of Nun; because they have wholly followed Yahweh.

032:013 Yahweh's anger was kindled against Israel, and he made

        them wander back and forth in the wilderness forty years,

        until all the generation, who had done evil in the sight

        of Yahweh, was consumed.

032:014 Behold, you are risen up in your fathers' place, an increase

        of sinful men, to augment yet the fierce anger of

        Yahweh toward Israel.

032:015 For if you turn away from after him, he will yet again leave

        them in the wilderness; and you will destroy all this people.

032:016 They came near to him, and said, We will build sheepfolds

        here for our livestock, and cities for our little ones:

032:017 but we ourselves will be ready armed to go before the children

        of Israel, until we have brought them to their place:

        and our little ones shall dwell in the fortified cities

        because of the inhabitants of the land.

032:018 We will not return to our houses, until the children of Israel

        have inherited every man his inheritance.

032:019 For we will not inherit with them on the other side of the Jordan,

        and forward; because our inheritance is fallen to us on this

        side of the Jordan eastward.

032:020 Moses said to them, If you will do this thing, if you will arm

        yourselves to go before Yahweh to the war,

032:021 and every armed man of you will pass over the Jordan before Yahweh,

        until he has driven out his enemies from before him,

032:022 and the land is subdued before Yahweh; then afterward you

        shall return, and be guiltless towards Yahweh, and towards Israel;

        and this land shall be to you for a possession before Yahweh.

032:023 But if you will not do so, behold, you have sinned against Yahweh;

        and be sure your sin will find you out.

032:024 Build you cities for your little ones, and folds for your sheep;

        and do that which has proceeded out of your mouth.

032:025 The children of Gad and the children of Reuben spoke to Moses,

        saying, Your servants will do as my lord commands.

032:026 Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our livestock,

        shall be there in the cities of Gilead;

032:027 but your servants will pass over, every man who is armed for war,

        before Yahweh to battle, as my lord says.

032:028 So Moses gave charge concerning them to Eleazar the priest,

        and to Joshua the son of Nun, and to the heads of the fathers'

        [houses] of the tribes of the children of Israel.

032:029 Moses said to them, If the children of Gad and the children

        of Reuben will pass with you over the Jordan, every man

        who is armed to battle, before Yahweh, and the land shall

        be subdued before you; then you shall give them the land

        of Gilead for a possession:

032:030 but if they will not pass over with you armed, they shall

        have possessions among you in the land of Canaan.

032:031 The children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered, saying,

        As Yahweh has said to your servants, so will we do.

032:032 We will pass over armed before Yahweh into the land of Canaan,

        and the possession of our inheritance [shall remain] with us

        beyond the Jordan.

032:033 Moses gave to them, even to the children of Gad, and to the children

        of Reuben, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph,

        the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, and the kingdom

        of Og king of Bashan, the land, according to the cities of it

        with [their] borders, even the cities of the land round about.

032:034 The children of Gad built Dibon, and Ataroth, and Aroer,

032:035 and Atrothshophan, and Jazer, and Jogbehah,

032:036 and Beth Nimrah, and Beth Haran:  fortified cities,

        and folds for sheep.

032:037 The children of Reuben built Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Kiriathaim,

032:038 and Nebo, and Baal Meon, (their names being changed), and Sibmah:

        and they gave other names to the cities which they built.

032:039 The children of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead,

        and took it, and dispossessed the Amorites who were therein.

032:040 Moses gave Gilead to Machir the son of Manasseh;

        and he lived therein.

032:041 Jair the son of Manasseh went and took the towns of it,

        and called them Havvoth Jair.

032:042 Nobah went and took Kenath, and the villages of it, and called

        it Nobah, after his own name.

033:001 These are the journeys of the children of Israel, when they

        went forth out of the land of Egypt by their armies under

        the hand of Moses and Aaron.

033:002 Moses wrote their goings out according to their journeys

        by the commandment of Yahweh:  and these are their journeys

        according to their goings out.

033:003 They traveled from Rameses in the first month, on the fifteenth

        day of the first month; on the next day after the Passover

        the children of Israel went out with a high hand in the sight

        of all the Egyptians,

033:004 while the Egyptians were burying all their firstborn,

        whom Yahweh had struck among them:  on their gods also

        Yahweh executed judgments.

033:005 The children of Israel traveled from Rameses, and encamped

        in Succoth.

033:006 They traveled from Succoth, and encamped in Etham, which is

        in the edge of the wilderness.

033:007 They traveled from Etham, and turned back to Pihahiroth,

        which is before Baal Zephon:  and they encamped before Migdol.

033:008 They traveled from before Hahiroth, and passed through the midst

        of the sea into the wilderness:  and they went three days'

        journey in the wilderness of Etham, and encamped in Marah.

033:009 They traveled from Marah, and came to Elim:  and in Elim

        were twelve springs of water, and seventy palm trees;

        and they encamped there.

033:010 They traveled from Elim, and encamped by the Red Sea{or, Sea of

        Reeds}.

033:011 They traveled from the Red Sea{or, Sea of Reeds}, and encamped

        in the wilderness of Sin.

033:012 They traveled from the wilderness of Sin, and encamped in Dophkah.

033:013 They traveled from Dophkah, and encamped in Alush.

033:014 They traveled from Alush, and encamped in Rephidim, where was

        no water for the people to drink.

033:015 They traveled from Rephidim, and encamped in the wilderness of Sinai.

033:016 They traveled from the wilderness of Sinai, and encamped

        in Kibroth Hattaavah.

033:017 They traveled from Kibroth Hattaavah, and encamped in Hazeroth.

033:018 They traveled from Hazeroth, and encamped in Rithmah.

033:019 They traveled from Rithmah, and encamped in Rimmon Perez.

033:020 They traveled from Rimmon Perez, and encamped in Libnah.

033:021 They traveled from Libnah, and encamped in Rissah.

033:022 They traveled from Rissah, and encamped in Kehelathah.

033:023 They traveled from Kehelathah, and encamped in Mount Shepher.

033:024 They traveled from Mount Shepher, and encamped in Haradah.

033:025 They traveled from Haradah, and encamped in Makheloth.

033:026 They traveled from Makheloth, and encamped in Tahath.

033:027 They traveled from Tahath, and encamped in Terah.

033:028 They traveled from Terah, and encamped in Mithkah.

033:029 They traveled from Mithkah, and encamped in Hashmonah.

033:030 They traveled from Hashmonah, and encamped in Moseroth.

033:031 They traveled from Moseroth, and encamped in Bene Jaakan.

033:032 They traveled from Bene Jaakan, and encamped in Hor Haggidgad.

033:033 They traveled from Hor Haggidgad, and encamped in Jotbathah.

033:034 They traveled from Jotbathah, and encamped in Abronah.

033:035 They traveled from Abronah, and encamped in Ezion Geber.

033:036 They traveled from Ezion Geber, and encamped in the wilderness

        of Zin (the same is Kadesh).

033:037 They traveled from Kadesh, and encamped in Mount Hor,

        in the edge of the land of Edom.

033:038 Aaron the priest went up into Mount Hor at the commandment

        of Yahweh, and died there, in the fortieth year after

        the children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt,

        in the fifth month, on the first day of the month.

033:039 Aaron was one hundred twenty-three years old when he died

        in Mount Hor.

033:040 The Canaanite, the king of Arad, who lived in the South in the land

        of Canaan, heard of the coming of the children of Israel.

033:041 They traveled from Mount Hor, and encamped in Zalmonah.

033:042 They traveled from Zalmonah, and encamped in Punon.

033:043 They traveled from Punon, and encamped in Oboth.

033:044 They traveled from Oboth, and encamped in Iye Abarim,

        in the border of Moab.

033:045 They traveled from Iyim, and encamped in Dibon Gad.

033:046 They traveled from Dibon Gad, and encamped in Almon Diblathaim.

033:047 They traveled from Almon Diblathaim, and encamped in the mountains

        of Abarim, before Nebo.

033:048 They traveled from the mountains of Abarim, and encamped

        in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho.

033:049 They encamped by the Jordan, from Beth Jeshimoth even to

        Abel Shittim in the plains of Moab.

033:050 Yahweh spoke to Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan

        at Jericho, saying,

033:051 Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them, When you pass

        over the Jordan into the land of Canaan,

033:052 then you shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land

        from before you, and destroy all their figured [stones],

        and destroy all their molten images, and demolish all

        their high places:

033:053 and you shall take possession of the land, and dwell therein;

        for to you have I given the land to possess it.

033:054 You shall inherit the land by lot according to your families;

        to the more you shall give the more inheritance,

        and to the fewer you shall give the less inheritance:

        wherever the lot falls to any man, that shall be his;

        according to the tribes of your fathers shall you inherit.

033:055 But if you will not drive out the inhabitants of the land

        from before you, then shall those who you let remain of them

        be as pricks in your eyes, and as thorns in your sides,

        and they shall vex you in the land in which you dwell.

033:056 It shall happen that as I thought to do to them, so will I

        do to you.

034:001 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

034:002 Command the children of Israel, and tell them, When you come

        into the land of Canaan (this is the land that shall fall

        to you for an inheritance, even the land of Canaan according

        to the borders of it),

034:003 then your south quarter shall be from the wilderness of Zin

        along by the side of Edom, and your south border shall be

        from the end of the Salt Sea eastward;

034:004 and your border shall turn about southward of the ascent

        of Akrabbim, and pass along to Zin; and the goings out of it

        shall be southward of Kadesh Barnea; and it shall go forth

        to Hazar Addar, and pass along to Azmon;

034:005 and the border shall turn about from Azmon to the brook of Egypt,

        and the goings out of it shall be at the sea.

034:006 For the western border, you shall have the great sea and

        the border [of it]: this shall be your west border.

034:007 This shall be your north border:  from the great sea you shall

        mark out for you Mount Hor;

034:008 from Mount Hor you shall mark out to the entrance of Hamath;

        and the goings out of the border shall be at Zedad;

034:009 and the border shall go forth to Ziphron, and the goings out of it

        shall be at Hazar Enan:  this shall be your north border.

034:010 You shall mark out your east border from Hazar Enan to Shepham;

034:011 and the border shall go down from Shepham to Riblah,

        on the east side of Ain; and the border shall go down,

        and shall reach to the side of the sea of Chinnereth eastward;

034:012 and the border shall go down to the Jordan, and the goings

        out of it shall be at the Salt Sea.  This shall be your land

        according to the borders of it round about.

034:013 Moses commanded the children of Israel, saying, This is the land

        which you shall inherit by lot, which Yahweh has commanded

        to give to the nine tribes, and to the half-tribe;

034:014 for the tribe of the children of Reuben according to their fathers'

        houses, and the tribe of the children of Gad according

        to their fathers' houses, have received, and the half-tribe

        of Manasseh have received, their inheritance:

034:015 the two tribes and the half-tribe have received their inheritance

        beyond the Jordan at Jericho eastward, toward the sunrise.

034:016 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

034:017 These are the names of the men who shall divide the land

        to you for inheritance:  Eleazar the priest, and Joshua

        the son of Nun.

034:018 You shall take one prince of every tribe, to divide

        the land for inheritance.

034:019 These are the names of the men:  Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the

        son of Jephunneh.

034:020 Of the tribe of the children of Simeon, Shemuel the son of Ammihud.

034:021 Of the tribe of Benjamin, Elidad the son of Chislon.

034:022 Of the tribe of the children of Dan a prince, Bukki the

        son of Jogli.

034:023 Of the children of Joseph:  of the tribe of the children

        of Manasseh a prince, Hanniel the son of Ephod.

034:024 Of the tribe of the children of Ephraim a prince, Kemuel the

        son of Shiphtan.

034:025 Of the tribe of the children of Zebulun a prince, Elizaphan the

        son of Parnach.

034:026 Of the tribe of the children of Issachar a prince,

        Paltiel the son of Azzan.

034:027 Of the tribe of the children of Asher a prince, Ahihud the

        son of Shelomi.

034:028 Of the tribe of the children of Naphtali a prince,

        Pedahel the son of Ammihud.

034:029 These are they whom Yahweh commanded to divide the inheritance

        to the children of Israel in the land of Canaan.

035:001 Yahweh spoke to Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan

        at Jericho, saying,

035:002 Command the children of Israel that they give to the Levites

        of the inheritance of their possession cities to dwell in;

        and suburbs for the cities round about them shall you give

        to the Levites.

035:003 The cities shall they have to dwell in; and their suburbs

        shall be for their livestock, and for their substance,

        and for all their animals.

035:004 The suburbs of the cities, which you shall give to the Levites,

        shall be from the wall of the city and outward one thousand

        cubits round about.

035:005 You shall measure outside of the city for the east side two

        thousand cubits, and for the south side two thousand cubits,

        and for the west side two thousand cubits, and for the north

        side two thousand cubits, the city being in the midst.

        This shall be to them the suburbs of the cities.

035:006 The cities which you shall give to the Levites, they shall be the six

        cities of refuge, which you shall give for the manslayer to flee to:

        and besides them you shall give forty-two cities.

035:007 All the cities which you shall give to the Levites shall be

        forty-eight cities; them [shall you give] with their suburbs.

035:008 Concerning the cities which you shall give of the possession

        of the children of Israel, from the many you shall take many;

        and from the few you shall take few:  everyone according

        to his inheritance which he inherits shall give of his cities

        to the Levites.

035:009 Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

035:010 Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them, When you pass

        over the Jordan into the land of Canaan,

035:011 then you shall appoint you cities to be cities of refuge

        for you, that the manslayer who kills any person unwittingly

        may flee there.

035:012 The cities shall be to you for refuge from the avenger,

        that the manslayer not die, until he stands before the

        congregation for judgment.

035:013 The cities which you shall give shall be for you six

        cities of refuge.

035:014 You shall give three cities beyond the Jordan, and three

        cities shall you give in the land of Canaan; they shall

        be cities of refuge.

035:015 For the children of Israel, and for the stranger and for the foreigner

        living among them, shall these six cities be for refuge;

        that everyone who kills any person unwittingly may flee there.

035:016 But if he struck him with an instrument of iron, so that he died,

        he is a murderer:  the murderer shall surely be put to death.

035:017 If he struck him with a stone in the hand, by which a man may die,

        and he died, he is a murderer:  the murderer shall surely

        be put to death.

035:018 Or if he struck him with a weapon of wood in the hand,

        by which a man may die, and he died, he is a murderer:

        the murderer shall surely be put to death.

035:019 The avenger of blood shall himself put the murderer to death:

        when he meets him, he shall put him to death.

035:020 If he thrust him of hatred, or hurled at him, lying in wait,

        so that he died,

035:021 or in enmity struck him with his hand, so that he died;

        he who struck him shall surely be put to death; he is a murderer:

        the avenger of blood shall put the murderer to death,

        when he meets him.

035:022 But if he thrust him suddenly without enmity, or hurled on him

        anything without lying in wait,

035:023 or with any stone, by which a man may die, not seeing him,

        and cast it on him, so that he died, and he was not his enemy,

        neither sought his harm;

035:024 then the congregation shall judge between the striker and

        the avenger of blood according to these ordinances;

035:025 and the congregation shall deliver the manslayer out of

        the hand of the avenger of blood, and the congregation shall

        restore him to his city of refuge, where he was fled:

        and he shall dwell therein until the death of the high priest,

        who was anointed with the holy oil.

035:026 But if the manslayer shall at any time go beyond the border

        of his city of refuge, where he flees,

035:027 and the avenger of blood find him outside of the border of his

        city of refuge, and the avenger of blood kill the manslayer;

        he shall not be guilty of blood,

035:028 because he should have remained in his city of refuge

        until the death of the high priest:  but after the death

        of the high priest the manslayer shall return into the land

        of his possession.

035:029 These things shall be for a statute [and] ordinance to you

        throughout your generations in all your dwellings.

035:030 Whoever kills any person, the murderer shall be slain at

        the mouth of witnesses:  but one witness shall not testify

        against any person that he die.

035:031 Moreover you shall take no ransom for the life of a murderer

        who is guilty of death; but he shall surely be put to death.

035:032 You shall take no ransom for him who is fled to his city

        of refuge, that he may come again to dwell in the land,

        until the death of the priest.

035:033 So you shall not pollute the land in which you are:

        for blood, it pollutes the land; and no expiation can

        be made for the land for the blood that is shed therein,

        but by the blood of him who shed it.

035:034 You shall not defile the land which you inhabit, in the midst

        of which I dwell:  for I, Yahweh, dwell in the midst of

        the children of Israel.

036:001 The heads of the fathers' [houses] of the family of the

        children of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh,

        of the families of the sons of Joseph, came near, and spoke

        before Moses, and before the princes, the heads of the fathers'

        [houses] of the children of Israel:

036:002 and they said, Yahweh commanded my lord to give the land

        for inheritance by lot to the children of Israel:

        and my lord was commanded by Yahweh to give the inheritance

        of Zelophehad our brother to his daughters.

036:003 If they be married to any of the sons of the [other] tribes

        of the children of Israel, then will their inheritance be taken

        away from the inheritance of our fathers, and will be added

        to the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they shall belong:

        so will it be taken away from the lot of our inheritance.

036:004 When the jubilee of the children of Israel shall be, then will

        their inheritance be added to the inheritance of the tribe

        whereunto they shall belong:  so will their inheritance be

        taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers.

036:005 Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word

        of Yahweh, saying, The tribe of the sons of Joseph speaks right.

036:006 This is the thing which Yahweh does command concerning

        the daughters of Zelophehad, saying, Let them be married

        to whom they think best; only into the family of the tribe

        of their father shall they be married.

036:007 So shall no inheritance of the children of Israel remove

        from tribe to tribe; for the children of Israel shall cleave

        everyone to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers.

036:008 Every daughter, who possesses an inheritance in any tribe

        of the children of Israel, shall be wife to one of the family

        of the tribe of her father, that the children of Israel may

        possess every man the inheritance of his fathers.

036:009 So shall no inheritance remove from one tribe to another tribe;

        for the tribes of the children of Israel shall cleave everyone

        to his own inheritance.

036:010 Even as Yahweh commanded Moses, so did the daughters of Zelophehad:

036:011 for Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah, the daughters

        of Zelophehad, were married to their father's brothers' sons.

036:012 They were married into the families of the sons of Manasseh

        the son of Joseph; and their inheritance remained in the tribe

        of the family of their father.

036:013 These are the commandments and the ordinances which Yahweh

        commanded by Moses to the children of Israel in the plains

        of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho.

Book 05 Deuteronomy

001:001 These are the words which Moses spoke to all Israel beyond

        the Jordan in the wilderness, in the Arabah over against Suph,

        between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Dizahab.

001:002 It is eleven days' [journey] from Horeb by the way of Mount Seir

        to Kadesh Barnea.

001:003 It happened in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month,

        on the first day of the month, that Moses spoke to the children

        of Israel, according to all that Yahweh had given him

        in commandment to them;

001:004 after he had struck Sihon the king of the Amorites,

        who lived in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, who lived

        in Ashtaroth, at Edrei.

001:005 Beyond the Jordan, in the land of Moab, began Moses to declare

        this law, saying,

001:006 Yahweh our God spoke to us in Horeb, saying, You have lived

        long enough in this mountain:

001:007 turn, and take your journey, and go to the hill country of

        the Amorites, and to all [the places] near there, in the Arabah,

        in the hill country, and in the lowland, and in the South,

        and by the seashore, the land of the Canaanites, and Lebanon,

        as far as the great river, the river Euphrates.

001:008 Behold, I have set the land before you:  go in and possess the land

        which Yahweh swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac,

        and to Jacob, to give to them and to their seed after them.

001:009 I spoke to you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear

        you myself alone:

001:010 Yahweh your God has multiplied you, and behold, you are this

        day as the stars of the sky for multitude.

001:011 Yahweh, the God of your fathers, make you a thousand times

        as many as you are, and bless you, as he has promised you!

001:012 How can I myself alone bear your encumbrance, and your burden,

        and your strife?

001:013 Take wise men of understanding and well known according

        to your tribes, and I will make them heads over you.

001:014 You answered me, and said, The thing which you have spoken

        is good [for us] to do.

001:015 So I took the heads of your tribes, wise men, and known,

        and made them heads over you, captains of thousands, and captains

        of hundreds, and captains of fifties, and captains of tens,

        and officers, according to your tribes.

001:016 I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear [the causes]

        between your brothers, and judge righteously between a man

        and his brother, and the foreigner who is living with him.

001:017 You shall not show partiality in judgment; you shall hear the small

        and the great alike; you shall not be afraid of the face of man;

        for the judgment is God's: and the cause that is too hard

        for you, you shall bring to me, and I will hear it.

001:018 I commanded you at that time all the things which you should do.

001:019 We traveled from Horeb, and went through all that great and

        terrible wilderness which you saw, by the way to the hill

        country of the Amorites, as Yahweh our God commanded us;

        and we came to Kadesh Barnea.

001:020 I said to you, You are come to the hill country of the Amorites,

        which Yahweh our God gives to us.

001:021 Behold, Yahweh your God has set the land before you:

        go up, take possession, as Yahweh, the God of your fathers,

        has spoken to you; don't be afraid, neither be dismayed.

001:022 You came near to me everyone of you, and said, Let us send

        men before us, that they may search the land for us,

        and bring us word again of the way by which we must go up,

        and the cities to which we shall come.

001:023 The thing pleased me well; and I took twelve men of you,

        one man for every tribe:

001:024 and they turned and went up into the hill country, and came

        to the valley of Eshcol, and spied it out.

001:025 They took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought

        it down to us, and brought us word again, and said,

        It is a good land which Yahweh our God gives to us.

001:026 Yet you wouldn't go up, but rebelled against the commandment

        of Yahweh your God:

001:027 and you murmured in your tents, and said, Because Yahweh

        hated us, he has brought us forth out of the land of Egypt,

        to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.

001:028 Where are we going up? our brothers have made our heart

        to melt, saying, The people are greater and taller than we;

        the cities are great and fortified up to the sky; and moreover

        we have seen the sons of the Anakim there.

001:029 Then I said to you, Don't dread, neither be afraid of them.

001:030 Yahweh your God who goes before you, he will fight for you,

        according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes,

001:031 and in the wilderness, where you have seen how that Yahweh

        your God bore you, as a man does bear his son, in all the way

        that you went, until you came to this place.

001:032 Yet in this thing you didn't believe Yahweh your God,

001:033 who went before you in the way, to seek you out a place to pitch

        your tents in, in fire by night, to show you by what way you

        should go, and in the cloud by day.

001:034 Yahweh heard the voice of your words, and was angry,

        and swore, saying,

001:035 Surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation

        see the good land, which I swore to give to your fathers,

001:036 save Caleb the son of Jephunneh:  he shall see it; and to him

        will I give the land that he has trodden on, and to his children,

        because he has wholly followed Yahweh.

001:037 Also Yahweh was angry with me for your sakes, saying, You also

        shall not go in there:

001:038 Joshua the son of Nun, who stands before you, he shall go in there:

        encourage you him; for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.

001:039 Moreover your little ones, whom you said should be a prey,

        and your children, who this day have no knowledge of good

        or evil, they shall go in there, and to them will I give it,

        and they shall possess it.

001:040 But as for you, turn you, and take your journey into the wilderness

        by the way to the Red Sea{or, Sea of Reeds}.

001:041 Then you answered and said to me, We have sinned against Yahweh,

        we will go up and fight, according to all that Yahweh our God

        commanded us.  You girded on every man his weapons of war,

        and were forward to go up into the hill country.

001:042 Yahweh said to me, Tell them, Don't go up, neither fight;

        for I am not among you; lest you be struck before your enemies.

001:043 So I spoke to you, and you didn't listen; but you rebelled

        against the commandment of Yahweh, and were presumptuous,

        and went up into the hill country.

001:044 The Amorites, who lived in that hill country, came out against you,

        and chased you, as bees do, and beat you down in Seir,

        even to Hormah.

001:045 You returned and wept before Yahweh; but Yahweh didn't listen

        to your voice, nor gave ear to you.

001:046 So you abode in Kadesh many days, according to the days

        that you abode [there].

002:001 Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by

        the way to the Red Sea{or, Sea of Reeds}, as Yahweh spoke to me;

        and we compassed Mount Seir many days.

002:002 Yahweh spoke to me, saying,

002:003 You have compassed this mountain long enough:

        turn you northward.

002:004 Command you the people, saying, You are to pass through

        the border of your brothers the children of Esau,

        who dwell in Seir; and they will be afraid of you:

        take good heed to yourselves therefore;

002:005 don't contend with them; for I will not give you of their land,

        no, not so much as for the sole of the foot to tread on;

        because I have given Mount Seir to Esau for a possession.

002:006 You shall purchase food of them for money, that you may eat;

        and you shall also buy water of them for money, that you may drink.

002:007 For Yahweh your God has blessed you in all the work of your hand;

        he has known your walking through this great wilderness:

        these forty years Yahweh your God has been with you;

        you have lacked nothing.

002:008 So we passed by from our brothers the children of Esau, who dwell

        in Seir, from the way of the Arabah from Elath and from Ezion Geber.

        We turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab.

002:009 Yahweh said to me, Don't bother Moab, neither contend with them

        in battle; for I will not give you of his land for a possession;

        because I have given Ar to the children of Lot for a possession.

002:010 (The Emim lived therein before, a people great, and many,

        and tall, as the Anakim:

002:011 these also are accounted Rephaim, as the Anakim; but the Moabites

        call them Emim.

002:012 The Horites also lived in Seir before, but the children of Esau

        succeeded them; and they destroyed them from before them,

        and lived in their place; as Israel did to the land of

        his possession, which Yahweh gave to them.)

002:013 Now rise up, and get you over the brook Zered.  We went over

        the brook Zered.

002:014 The days in which we came from Kadesh Barnea, until we

        were come over the brook Zered, were thirty-eight years;

        until all the generation of the men of war were consumed

        from the midst of the camp, as Yahweh swore to them.

002:015 Moreover the hand of Yahweh was against them, to destroy them

        from the midst of the camp, until they were consumed.

002:016 So it happened, when all the men of war were consumed and dead

        from among the people,

002:017 that Yahweh spoke to me, saying,

002:018 You are this day to pass over Ar, the border of Moab:

002:019 and when you come near over against the children of Ammon,

        don't bother them, nor contend with them; for I will not give

        you of the land of the children of Ammon for a possession;

        because I have given it to the children of Lot for a possession.

002:020 (That also is accounted a land of Rephaim:  Rephaim lived

        therein before; but the Ammonites call them Zamzummim,

002:021 a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakim;

        but Yahweh destroyed them before them; and they succeeded them,

        and lived in their place;

002:022 as he did for the children of Esau, who dwell in Seir,

        when he destroyed the Horites from before them; and they

        succeeded them, and lived in their place even to this day:

002:023 and the Avvim, who lived in villages as far as Gaza,

        the Caphtorim, who came forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them,

        and lived in their place.)

002:024 Rise up, take your journey, and pass over the valley of the Arnon:

        behold, I have given into your hand Sihon the Amorite,

        king of Heshbon, and his land; begin to possess it, and contend

        with him in battle.

002:025 This day will I begin to put the dread of you and the fear

        of you on the peoples who are under the whole sky, who shall

        hear the report of you, and shall tremble, and be in anguish

        because of you.

002:026 I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth to Sihon

        king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying,

002:027 Let me pass through your land:  I will go along by the highway,

        I will turn neither to the right hand nor to the left.

002:028 You shall sell me food for money, that I may eat; and give me

        water for money, that I may drink:  only let me pass through

        on my feet,

002:029 as the children of Esau who dwell in Seir, and the Moabites

        who dwell in Ar, did to me; until I shall pass over the Jordan

        into the land which Yahweh our God gives us.

002:030 But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him;

        for Yahweh your God hardened his spirit, and made his

        heart obstinate, that he might deliver him into your hand,

        as at this day.

002:031 Yahweh said to me, Behold, I have begun to deliver up Sihon

        and his land before you:  begin to possess, that you may

        inherit his land.

002:032 Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people,

        to battle at Jahaz.

002:033 Yahweh our God delivered him up before us; and we struck him,

        and his sons, and all his people.

002:034 We took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed

        every inhabited city, with the women and the little ones;

        we left none remaining:

002:035 only the livestock we took for a prey to ourselves,

        with the spoil of the cities which we had taken.

002:036 From Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon,

        and [from] the city that is in the valley, even to Gilead,

        there was not a city too high for us; Yahweh our God delivered

        up all before us:

002:037 only to the land of the children of Ammon you didn't come near;

        all the side of the river Jabbok, and the cities of the hill country,

        and wherever Yahweh our God forbade us.

003:001 Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan:  and Og the king

        of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people,

        to battle at Edrei.

003:002 Yahweh said to me, Don't fear him; for I have delivered him,

        and all his people, and his land, into your hand; and you

        shall do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites,

        who lived at Heshbon.

003:003 So Yahweh our God delivered into our hand Og also, the king

        of Bashan, and all his people:  and we struck him until none

        was left to him remaining.

003:004 We took all his cities at that time; there was not a city which we

        didn't take from them; sixty cities, all the region of Argob,

        the kingdom of Og in Bashan.

003:005 All these were cities fortified with high walls, gates, and bars;

        besides the unwalled towns a great many.

003:006 We utterly destroyed them, as we did to Sihon king of Heshbon,

        utterly destroying every inhabited city, with the women

        and the little ones.

003:007 But all the livestock, and the spoil of the cities, we took

        for a prey to ourselves.

003:008 We took the land at that time out of the hand of the two kings

        of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, from the valley

        of the Arnon to Mount Hermon;

003:009 ([which] Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion, and the Amorites

        call it Senir;)

003:010 all the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan,

        to Salecah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.

003:011 (For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of

        the Rephaim; behold, his bedstead was a bedstead of iron;

        isn't it in Rabbah of the children of Ammon? nine cubits

        was the length of it, and four cubits the breadth of it,

        after the cubit of a man.)

003:012 This land we took in possession at that time:  from Aroer,

        which is by the valley of the Arnon, and half the hill country

        of Gilead, and the cities of it, gave I to the Reubenites

        and to the Gadites:

003:013 and the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, the kingdom of Og,

        gave I to the half-tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob,

        even all Bashan.  (The same is called the land of Rephaim.

003:014 Jair the son of Manasseh took all the region of Argob,

        to the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites,

        and called them, even Bashan, after his own name, Havvoth Jair,

        to this day.)

003:015 I gave Gilead to Machir.

003:016 To the Reubenites and to the Gadites I gave from Gilead

        even to the valley of the Arnon, the middle of the valley,

        and the border [of it], even to the river Jabbok, which is

        the border of the children of Ammon;

003:017 the Arabah also, and the Jordan and the border [of it],

        from Chinnereth even to the sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea,

        under the slopes of Pisgah eastward.

003:018 I commanded you at that time, saying, Yahweh your God has given

        you this land to possess it:  you shall pass over armed before

        your brothers the children of Israel, all the men of valor.

003:019 But your wives, and your little ones, and your livestock,

        (I know that you have much livestock), shall abide in your

        cities which I have given you,

003:020 until Yahweh give rest to your brothers, as to you, and they

        also possess the land which Yahweh your God gives them beyond

        the Jordan:  then shall you return every man to his possession,

        which I have given you.

003:021 I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Your eyes have seen

        all that Yahweh your God has done to these two kings:

        so shall Yahweh do to all the kingdoms where you go over.

003:022 You shall not fear them; for Yahweh your God, he it is who

        fights for you.

003:023 I begged Yahweh at that time, saying,

003:024 Lord Yahweh, you have begun to show your servant your greatness,

        and your strong hand:  for what god is there in heaven or

        in earth, that can do according to your works, and according

        to your mighty acts?

003:025 Please let me go over and see the good land that is beyond

        the Jordan, that goodly mountain, and Lebanon.

003:026 But Yahweh was angry with me for your sakes, and didn't

        listen to me; and Yahweh said to me, Let it suffice you;

        speak no more to me of this matter.

003:027 Go up to the top of Pisgah, and lift up your eyes westward,

        and northward, and southward, and eastward, and see with your eyes:

        for you shall not go over this Jordan.

003:028 But charge Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him;

        for he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause

        them to inherit the land which you shall see.

003:029 So we abode in the valley over against Beth Peor.

004:001 Now, Israel, listen to the statutes and to the ordinances, which I

        teach you, to do them; that you may live, and go in and possess

        the land which Yahweh, the God of your fathers, gives you.

004:002 You shall not add to the word which I command you, neither shall

        you diminish from it, that you may keep the commandments

        of Yahweh your God which I command you.

004:003 Your eyes have seen what Yahweh did because of Baal Peor;

        for all the men who followed Baal Peor, Yahweh your God has

        destroyed them from the midst of you.

004:004 But you who did cleave to Yahweh your God are alive everyone

        of you this day.

004:005 Behold, I have taught you statutes and ordinances, even as Yahweh

        my God commanded me, that you should do so in the midst

        of the land where you go in to possess it.

004:006 Keep therefore and do them; for this is your wisdom and your

        understanding in the sight of the peoples, who shall hear all

        these statutes, and say, Surely this great nation is a wise

        and understanding people.

004:007 For what great nation is there, that has a god so near to them,

        as Yahweh our God is whenever we call on him?

004:008 What great nation is there, that has statutes and ordinances

        so righteous as all this law, which I set before you this day?

004:009 Only take heed to yourself, and keep your soul diligently,

        lest you forget the things which your eyes saw, and lest they

        depart from your heart all the days of your life; but make

        them known to your children and your children's children;

004:010 the day that you stood before Yahweh your God in Horeb,

        when Yahweh said to me, Assemble me the people, and I

        will make them hear my words, that they may learn to fear

        me all the days that they live on the earth, and that they

        may teach their children.

004:011 You came near and stood under the mountain; and the mountain

        burned with fire to the heart of the sky, with darkness,

        cloud, and thick darkness.

004:012 Yahweh spoke to you out of the midst of the fire:

        you heard the voice of words, but you saw no form; only [you

        heard] a voice.

004:013 He declared to you his covenant, which he commanded you

        to perform, even the ten commandments; and he wrote them

        on two tables of stone.

004:014 Yahweh commanded me at that time to teach you statutes

        and ordinances, that you might do them in the land where you

        go over to possess it.

004:015 Take therefore good heed to yourselves; for you saw no manner

        of form on the day that Yahweh spoke to you in Horeb out

        of the midst of the fire.

004:016 Lest you corrupt yourselves, and make yourself an engraved image

        in the form of any figure, the likeness of male or female,

004:017 the likeness of any animal that is on the earth, the likeness

        of any winged bird that flies in the sky,

004:018 the likeness of anything that creeps on the ground, the likeness

        of any fish that is in the water under the earth;

004:019 and lest you lift up your eyes to the sky, and when you see

        the sun and the moon and the stars, even all the army of the sky,

        you are drawn away and worship them, and serve them,

        which Yahweh your God has allotted to all the peoples under

        the whole sky.

004:020 But Yahweh has taken you, and brought you forth out of the iron

        furnace, out of Egypt, to be to him a people of inheritance,

        as at this day.

004:021 Furthermore Yahweh was angry with me for your sakes,

        and swore that I should not go over the Jordan, and that I

        should not go in to that good land, which Yahweh your God

        gives you for an inheritance:

004:022 but I must die in this land, I must not go over the Jordan;

        but you shall go over, and possess that good land.

004:023 Take heed to yourselves, lest you forget the covenant of Yahweh

        your God, which he made with you, and make you an engraved image

        in the form of anything which Yahweh your God has forbidden you.

004:024 For Yahweh your God is a devouring fire, a jealous God.

004:025 When you shall father children, and children's children, and you

        shall have been long in the land, and shall corrupt yourselves,

        and make an engraved image in the form of anything, and shall

        do that which is evil in the sight of Yahweh your God,

        to provoke him to anger;

004:026 I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day,

        that you shall soon utterly perish from off the land whereunto

        you go over the Jordan to possess it; you shall not prolong

        your days on it, but shall utterly be destroyed.

004:027 Yahweh will scatter you among the peoples, and you shall

        be left few in number among the nations, where Yahweh shall

        lead you away.

004:028 There you shall serve gods, the work of men's hands, wood and stone,

        which neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell.

004:029 But from there you shall seek Yahweh your God, and you shall

        find him, when you search after him with all your heart

        and with all your soul.

004:030 When you are in oppression, and all these things are come on you,

        in the latter days you shall return to Yahweh your God,

        and listen to his voice:

004:031 for Yahweh your God is a merciful God; he will not fail you,

        neither destroy you, nor forget the covenant of your fathers

        which he swore to them.

004:032 For ask now of the days that are past, which were before you,

        since the day that God created man on the earth, and from

        the one end of the sky to the other, whether there has

        been [any such thing] as this great thing is, or has been

        heard like it?

004:033 Did ever a people hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst

        of the fire, as you have heard, and live?

004:034 Or has God tried to go and take him a nation from the midst

        of [another] nation, by trials, by signs, and by wonders,

        and by war, and by a mighty hand, and by an outstretched arm,

        and by great terrors, according to all that Yahweh your God

        did for you in Egypt before your eyes?

004:035 To you it was shown, that you might know that Yahweh he is God;

        there is none else besides him.

004:036 Out of heaven he made you to hear his voice, that he might

        instruct you:  and on earth he made you to see his great fire;

        and you heard his words out of the midst of the fire.

004:037 Because he loved your fathers, therefore he chose their

        seed after them, and brought you out with his presence,

        with his great power, out of Egypt;

004:038 to drive out nations from before you greater and mightier than you,

        to bring you in, to give you their land for an inheritance,

        as at this day.

004:039 Know therefore this day, and lay it to your heart, that Yahweh

        he is God in heaven above and on the earth beneath;

        there is none else.

004:040 You shall keep his statutes, and his commandments, which I

        command you this day, that it may go well with you, and with

        your children after you, and that you may prolong your days

        in the land, which Yahweh your God gives you, forever.

004:041 Then Moses set apart three cities beyond the Jordan

        toward the sunrise;

004:042 that the manslayer might flee there, who kills his neighbor unawares,

        and didn't hate him in time past; and that fleeing to one

        of these cities he might live:

004:043 [namely], Bezer in the wilderness, in the plain country,

        for the Reubenites; and Ramoth in Gilead, for the Gadites;

        and Golan in Bashan, for the Manassites.

004:044 This is the law which Moses set before the children of Israel:

004:045 these are the testimonies, and the statutes, and the ordinances,

        which Moses spoke to the children of Israel, when they came

        forth out of Egypt,

004:046 beyond the Jordan, in the valley over against Beth Peor,

        in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived at Heshbon,

        whom Moses and the children of Israel struck, when they came

        forth out of Egypt.

004:047 They took his land in possession, and the land of Og king

        of Bashan, the two kings of the Amorites, who were beyond

        the Jordan toward the sunrise;

004:048 from Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon,

        even to Mount Sion (the same is Hermon),

004:049 and all the Arabah beyond the Jordan eastward, even to the sea

        of the Arabah, under the slopes of Pisgah.

005:001 Moses called to all Israel, and said to them, Hear, Israel,

        the statutes and the ordinances which I speak in your ears

        this day, that you may learn them, and observe to do them.

005:002 Yahweh our God made a covenant with us in Horeb.

005:003 Yahweh didn't make this covenant with our fathers, but with us,

        even us, who are all of us here alive this day.

005:004 Yahweh spoke with you face to face on the mountain out of

        the midst of the fire,

005:005 (I stood between Yahweh and you at that time, to show you

        the word of Yahweh:  for you were afraid because of the fire,

        and didn't go up onto the mountain;) saying,

005:006 "I am Yahweh your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt,

        out of the house of bondage.

005:007 You shall have no other gods before me.

005:008 "You shall not make an engraved image for yourself,

        [nor] any likeness [of anything] that is in heaven above,

        or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water

        under the earth:

005:009 you shall not bow down yourself to them, nor serve them;

        for I, Yahweh, your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity

        of the fathers on the children, and on the third and on

        the fourth generation of those who hate me;

005:010 and showing loving kindness to thousands of those who love me

        and keep my commandments.

005:011 "You shall not take the name of Yahweh your God in vain:

        for Yahweh will not hold him guiltless who takes his name in vain.

005:012 "Observe the Sabbath day, to keep it holy, as Yahweh your

        God commanded you.

005:013 Six days shall you labor, and do all your work;

005:014 but the seventh day is a Sabbath to Yahweh your God:

        [in it] you shall not do any work, you, nor your son,

        nor your daughter, nor your male servant, nor your female servant,

        nor your ox, nor your donkey, nor any of your livestock,

        nor your stranger who is within your gates; that your male

        servant and your female servant may rest as well as you.

005:015 You shall remember that you were a servant in the land of Egypt,

        and Yahweh your God brought you out of there by a mighty

        hand and by an outstretched arm:  therefore Yahweh your God

        commanded you to keep the Sabbath day.

005:016 "Honor your father and your mother, as Yahweh your God commanded you;

        that your days may be long, and that it may go well with you,

        in the land which Yahweh your God gives you.

005:017 "You shall not murder.

005:018 "Neither shall you commit adultery.

005:019 "Neither shall you steal.

005:020 "Neither shall you give false testimony against your neighbor.

005:021 "Neither shall you covet your neighbor's wife; neither shall you

        desire your neighbor's house, his field, or his male servant,

        or his female servant, his ox, or his donkey, or anything

        that is your neighbor's."

005:022 These words Yahweh spoke to all your assembly on the mountain

        out of the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the

        thick darkness, with a great voice:  and he added no more.

        He wrote them on two tables of stone, and gave them to me.

005:023 It happened, when you heard the voice out of the midst

        of the darkness, while the mountain was burning with fire,

        that you came near to me, even all the heads of your tribes,

        and your elders;

005:024 and you said, Behold, Yahweh our God has shown us his glory

        and his greatness, and we have heard his voice out of the midst

        of the fire:  we have seen this day that God does speak with man,

        and he lives.

005:025 Now therefore why should we die? for this great fire will

        consume us:  if we hear the voice of Yahweh our God any more,

        then we shall die.

005:026 For who is there of all flesh, that has heard the voice

        of the living God speaking out of the midst of the fire,

        as we have, and lived?

005:027 Go you near, and hear all that Yahweh our God shall say:

        and speak you to us all that Yahweh our God shall speak to you;

        and we will hear it, and do it.

005:028 Yahweh heard the voice of your words, when you spoke to me;

        and Yahweh said to me, I have heard the voice of the words

        of this people, which they have spoken to you:

        they have well said all that they have spoken.

005:029 Oh that there were such a heart in them, that they would fear me,

        and keep all my commandments always, that it might be well

        with them, and with their children forever!

005:030 Go tell them, Return you to your tents.

005:031 But as for you, stand you here by me, and I will speak to you

        all the commandment, and the statutes, and the ordinances,

        which you shall teach them, that they may do them in the land

        which I give them to possess it.

005:032 You shall observe to do therefore as Yahweh your God has

        commanded you:  you shall not turn aside to the right hand

        or to the left.

005:033 You shall walk in all the way which Yahweh your God has

        commanded you, that you may live, and that it may be well

        with you, and that you may prolong your days in the land

        which you shall possess.

006:001 Now this is the commandment, the statutes, and the ordinances,

        which Yahweh your God commanded to teach you, that you might

        do them in the land where you go over to possess it;

006:002 that you might fear Yahweh your God, to keep all his statutes

        and his commandments, which I command you, you, and your son,

        and your son's son, all the days of your life; and that your

        days may be prolonged.

006:003 Hear therefore, Israel, and observe to do it; that it

        may be well with you, and that you may increase mightily,

        as Yahweh, the God of your fathers, has promised to you,

        in a land flowing with milk and honey.

006:004 Hear, Israel:  Yahweh is our God; Yahweh is one:

006:005 and you shall love Yahweh your God with all your heart,

        and with all your soul, and with all your might.

006:006 These words, which I command you this day, shall be on your heart;

006:007 and you shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall

        talk of them when you sit in your house, and when you walk

        by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise up.

006:008 You shall bind them for a sign on your hand, and they shall

        be for symbols between your eyes.

006:009 You shall write them on the door posts of your house,

        and on your gates.

006:010 It shall be, when Yahweh your God shall bring you into

        the land which he swore to your fathers, to Abraham,

        to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give you, great and goodly cities,

        which you didn't build,

006:011 and houses full of all good things, which you didn't fill,

        and cisterns dug out, which you didn't dig, vineyards and

        olive trees, which you didn't plant, and you shall eat

        and be full;

006:012 then beware lest you forget Yahweh, who brought you forth

        out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.

006:013 You shall fear Yahweh your God; and him shall you serve,

        and shall swear by his name.

006:014 You shall not go after other gods, of the gods of the peoples

        who are round about you;

006:015 for Yahweh your God in the midst of you is a jealous God;

        lest the anger of Yahweh your God be kindled against you,

        and he destroy you from off the face of the earth.

006:016 You shall not tempt Yahweh your God, as you tempted him in Massah.

006:017 You shall diligently keep the commandments of Yahweh your God,

        and his testimonies, and his statutes, which he has commanded you.

006:018 You shall do that which is right and good in the sight of Yahweh;

        that it may be well with you, and that you may go in and possess

        the good land which Yahweh swore to your fathers,

006:019 to thrust out all your enemies from before you, as Yahweh has spoken.

006:020 When your son asks you in time to come, saying, What mean

        the testimonies, and the statutes, and the ordinances,

        which Yahweh our God has commanded you?

006:021 then you shall tell your son, We were Pharaoh's bondservants

        in Egypt:  and Yahweh brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand;

006:022 and Yahweh showed great and awesome signs and wonders on Egypt,

        on Pharaoh, and on all his house, before our eyes;

006:023 and he brought us out from there, that he might bring us in,

        to give us the land which he swore to our fathers.

006:024 Yahweh commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear Yahweh

        our God, for our good always, that he might preserve us alive,

        as at this day.

006:025 It shall be righteousness to us, if we observe to do all this

        commandment before Yahweh our God, as he has commanded us.

007:001 When Yahweh your God shall bring you into the land where you

        go to possess it, and shall cast out many nations before you,

        the Hittite, and the Girgashite, and the Amorite, and the Canaanite,

        and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite,

        seven nations greater and mightier than you;

007:002 and when Yahweh your God shall deliver them up before you,

        and you shall strike them; then you shall utterly destroy them:

        you shall make no covenant with them, nor show mercy to them;

007:003 neither shall you make marriages with them; your daughter you

        shall not give to his son, nor his daughter shall you take

        to your son.

007:004 For he will turn away your son from following me, that they

        may serve other gods:  so will the anger of Yahweh be kindled

        against you, and he will destroy you quickly.

007:005 But thus shall you deal with them:  you shall break down their altars,

        and dash in pieces their pillars, and hew down their Asherim,

        and burn their engraved images with fire.

007:006 For you are a holy people to Yahweh your God:  Yahweh your

        God has chosen you to be a people for his own possession,

        above all peoples who are on the face of the earth.

007:007 Yahweh didn't set his love on you, nor choose you, because you

        were more in number than any people; for you were the fewest

        of all peoples:

007:008 but because Yahweh loves you, and because he would keep the oath

        which he swore to your fathers, has Yahweh brought you out with

        a mighty hand, and redeemed you out of the house of bondage,

        from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt.

007:009 Know therefore that Yahweh your God, he is God, the faithful God,

        who keeps covenant and loving kindness with them who love

        him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations,

007:010 and repays those who hate him to their face, to destroy them:

        he will not be slack to him who hates him, he will repay him

        to his face.

007:011 You shall therefore keep the commandment, and the statutes,

        and the ordinances, which I command you this day, to do them.

007:012 It shall happen, because you listen to these ordinances,

        and keep and do them, that Yahweh your God will keep with

        you the covenant and the loving kindness which he swore

        to your fathers:

007:013 and he will love you, and bless you, and multiply you;

        he will also bless the fruit of your body and the fruit

        of your ground, your grain and your new wine and your oil,

        the increase of your livestock and the young of your flock,

        in the land which he swore to your fathers to give you.

007:014 You shall be blessed above all peoples:  there shall not be

        male or female barren among you, or among your livestock.

007:015 Yahweh will take away from you all sickness; and none of the evil

        diseases of Egypt, which you know, he will put on you,

        but will lay them on all those who hate you.

007:016 You shall consume all the peoples whom Yahweh your God

        shall deliver to you; your eye shall not pity them:

        neither shall you serve their gods; for that will be a

        snare to you.

007:017 If you shall say in your heart, These nations are more than I;

        how can I dispossess them?

007:018 you shall not be afraid of them:  you shall well remember

        what Yahweh your God did to Pharaoh, and to all Egypt;

007:019 the great trials which your eyes saw, and the signs,

        and the wonders, and the mighty hand, and the outstretched arm,

        by which Yahweh your God brought you out:  so shall Yahweh

        your God do to all the peoples of whom you are afraid.

007:020 Moreover Yahweh your God will send the hornet among them,

        until those who are left, and hide themselves,

        perish from before you.

007:021 You shall not be scared of them; for Yahweh your God is in

        the midst of you, a great and awesome God.

007:022 Yahweh your God will cast out those nations before you

        by little and little:  you may not consume them at once,

        lest the animals of the field increase on you.

007:023 But Yahweh your God will deliver them up before you, and will

        confuse them with a great confusion, until they be destroyed.

007:024 He will deliver their kings into your hand, and you

        shall make their name to perish from under the sky:

        there shall no man be able to stand before you, until you

        have destroyed them.

007:025 The engraved images of their gods shall you burn with fire:

        you shall not covet the silver or the gold that is on them,

        nor take it to you, lest you be snared therein; for it is

        an abomination to Yahweh your God.

007:026 You shall not bring an abomination into your house, and become

        a devoted thing like it:  you shall utterly detest it,

        and you shall utterly abhor it; for it is a devoted thing.

008:001 All the commandment which I command you this day shall you

        observe to do, that you may live, and multiply, and go

        in and possess the land which Yahweh swore to your fathers.

008:002 You shall remember all the way which Yahweh your God has led you

        these forty years in the wilderness, that he might humble you,

        to prove you, to know what was in your heart, whether you

        would keep his commandments, or not.

008:003 He humbled you, and allowed you to hunger, and fed you with manna,

        which you didn't know, neither did your fathers know;

        that he might make you know that man does not live by bread only,

        but by everything that proceeds out of the mouth of Yahweh

        does man live.

008:004 Your clothing didn't grow old on you, neither did your foot swell,

        these forty years.

008:005 You shall consider in your heart that as a man chastens his son,

        so Yahweh your God chastens you.

008:006 You shall keep the commandments of Yahweh your God, to walk

        in his ways, and to fear him.

008:007 For Yahweh your God brings you into a good land, a land

        of brooks of water, of springs, and underground water flowing

        into valleys and hills;

008:008 a land of wheat and barley, and vines and fig trees and pomegranates;

        a land of olive trees and honey;

008:009 a land in which you shall eat bread without scarceness,

        you shall not lack anything in it; a land whose stones are iron,

        and out of whose hills you may dig copper.

008:010 You shall eat and be full, and you shall bless Yahweh your God

        for the good land which he has given you.

008:011 Beware lest you forget Yahweh your God, in not keeping

        his commandments, and his ordinances, and his statutes,

        which I command you this day:

008:012 lest, when you have eaten and are full, and have built

        goodly houses, and lived therein;

008:013 and when your herds and your flocks multiply, and your silver

        and your gold is multiplied, and all that you have is multiplied;

008:014 then your heart be lifted up, and you forget Yahweh your God,

        who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, out of

        the house of bondage;

008:015 who led you through the great and terrible wilderness,

        [in which were] fiery serpents and scorpions, and thirsty

        ground where was no water; who brought you forth water out

        of the rock of flint;

008:016 who fed you in the wilderness with manna, which your fathers

        didn't know; that he might humble you, and that he might prove you,

        to do you good at your latter end:

008:017 and [lest] you say in your heart, My power and the might of my

        hand has gotten me this wealth.

008:018 But you shall remember Yahweh your God, for it is he who gives

        you power to get wealth; that he may establish his covenant

        which he swore to your fathers, as at this day.

008:019 It shall be, if you shall forget Yahweh your God, and walk

        after other gods, and serve them, and worship them, I testify

        against you this day that you shall surely perish.

008:020 As the nations that Yahweh makes to perish before you,

        so shall you perish; because you wouldn't listen to the voice

        of Yahweh your God.

009:001 Hear, Israel:  you are to pass over the Jordan this day, to go

        in to dispossess nations greater and mightier than yourself,

        cities great and fortified up to the sky,

009:002 a people great and tall, the sons of the Anakim, whom you know,

        and of whom you have heard say, Who can stand before

        the sons of Anak?

009:003 Know therefore this day, that Yahweh your God is he who goes

        over before you as a devouring fire; he will destroy them,

        and he will bring them down before you:  so shall you drive

        them out, and make them to perish quickly, as Yahweh has

        spoken to you.

009:004 Don't speak in your heart, after that Yahweh your God

        has thrust them out from before you, saying, For my

        righteousness Yahweh has brought me in to possess this land;

        whereas for the wickedness of these nations Yahweh does drive

        them out from before you.

009:005 Not for your righteousness, or for the uprightness of your heart,

        do you go in to possess their land; but for the wickedness

        of these nations Yahweh your God does drive them out from

        before you, and that he may establish the word which Yahweh

        swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.

009:006 Know therefore, that Yahweh your God doesn't give you this

        good land to possess it for your righteousness; for you are

        a stiff-necked people.

009:007 Remember, don't forget, how you provoked Yahweh your God

        to wrath in the wilderness:  from the day that you went forth

        out of the land of Egypt, until you came to this place,

        you have been rebellious against Yahweh.

009:008 Also in Horeb you provoked Yahweh to wrath, and Yahweh was angry

        with you to destroy you.

009:009 When I was gone up onto the mountain to receive the tables of stone,

        even the tables of the covenant which Yahweh made with you,

        then I stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights;

        I did neither eat bread nor drink water.

009:010 Yahweh delivered to me the two tables of stone written

        with the finger of God; and on them [was written] according

        to all the words, which Yahweh spoke with you on the mountain

        out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly.

009:011 It came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights,

        that Yahweh gave me the two tables of stone, even the tables

        of the covenant.

009:012 Yahweh said to me, Arise, get you down quickly from hence;

        for your people whom you have brought forth out of Egypt

        have corrupted themselves; they have quickly turned aside

        out of the way which I commanded them; they have made them

        a molten image.

009:013 Furthermore Yahweh spoke to me, saying, I have seen this people,

        and behold, it is a stiff-necked people:

009:014 let me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name

        from under the sky; and I will make of you a nation mightier

        and greater than they.

009:015 So I turned and came down from the mountain, and the mountain

        was burning with fire:  and the two tables of the covenant

        were in my two hands.

009:016 I looked, and behold, you had sinned against Yahweh your God;

        you had made you a molten calf:  you had turned aside quickly

        out of the way which Yahweh had commanded you.

009:017 I took hold of the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands,

        and broke them before your eyes.

009:018 I fell down before Yahweh, as at the first, forty days

        and forty nights; I did neither eat bread nor drink water;

        because of all your sin which you sinned, in doing that which

        was evil in the sight of Yahweh, to provoke him to anger.

009:019 For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure,

        with which Yahweh was angry against you to destroy you.

        But Yahweh listened to me that time also.

009:020 Yahweh was very angry with Aaron to destroy him:

        and I prayed for Aaron also at the same time.

009:021 I took your sin, the calf which you had made, and burnt it

        with fire, and stamped it, grinding it very small, until it

        was as fine as dust:  and I cast the dust of it into the brook

        that descended out of the mountain.

009:022 At Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibroth Hattaavah,

        you provoked Yahweh to wrath.

009:023 When Yahweh sent you from Kadesh Barnea, saying, Go up and possess

        the land which I have given you; then you rebelled against

        the commandment of Yahweh your God, and you didn't believe him,

        nor listen to his voice.

009:024 You have been rebellious against Yahweh from the day that

        I knew you.

009:025 So I fell down before Yahweh the forty days and forty nights

        that I fell down, because Yahweh had said he would destroy you.

009:026 I prayed to Yahweh, and said, Lord Yahweh, don't destroy your

        people and your inheritance, that you have redeemed through

        your greatness, that you have brought forth out of Egypt

        with a mighty hand.

009:027 Remember your servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; don't look

        to the stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness,

        nor to their sin,

009:028 lest the land whence you brought us out say, Because Yahweh was

        not able to bring them into the land which he promised to them,

        and because he hated them, he has brought them out to kill

        them in the wilderness.

009:029 Yet they are your people and your inheritance, which you brought

        out by your great power and by your outstretched arm.

010:001 At that time Yahweh said to me, Hew you two tables of stone

        like the first, and come up to me onto the mountain,

        and make an ark of wood.

010:002 I will write on the tables the words that were on the first

        tables which you broke, and you shall put them in the ark.

010:003 So I made an ark of acacia wood, and hewed two tables

        of stone like the first, and went up onto the mountain,

        having the two tables in my hand.

010:004 He wrote on the tables, according to the first writing,

        the ten commandments, which Yahweh spoke to you on the mountain

        out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly:

        and Yahweh gave them to me.

010:005 I turned and came down from the mountain, and put the tables

        in the ark which I had made; and there they are as

        Yahweh commanded me.

010:006 (The children of Israel traveled from Beeroth Bene Jaakan to Moserah.

        There Aaron died, and there he was buried; and Eleazar his son

        ministered in the priest's office in his place.

010:007 From there they traveled to Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah

        to Jotbathah, a land of brooks of water.

010:008 At that time Yahweh set apart the tribe of Levi, to bear

        the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, to stand before Yahweh

        to minister to him, and to bless in his name, to this day.

010:009 Therefore Levi has no portion nor inheritance with his brothers;

        Yahweh is his inheritance, according as Yahweh your God

        spoke to him.)

010:010 I stayed on the mountain, as at the first time, forty days

        and forty nights:  and Yahweh listened to me that time also;

        Yahweh would not destroy you.

010:011 Yahweh said to me, Arise, take your journey before the people;

        and they shall go in and possess the land, which I swore

        to their fathers to give to them.

010:012 Now, Israel, what does Yahweh your God require of you,

        but to fear Yahweh your God, to walk in all his ways,

        and to love him, and to serve Yahweh your God with all your

        heart and with all your soul,

010:013 to keep the commandments of Yahweh, and his statutes, which I

        command you this day for your good?

010:014 Behold, to Yahweh your God belongs heaven and the heaven

        of heavens, the earth, with all that is therein.

010:015 Only Yahweh had a delight in your fathers to love them,

        and he chose their seed after them, even you above all peoples,

        as at this day.

010:016 Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be

        no more stiff-necked.

010:017 For Yahweh your God, he is God of gods, and Lord of lords,

        the great God, the mighty, and the awesome, who doesn't

        regard persons, nor takes reward.

010:018 He does execute justice for the fatherless and widow,

        and loves the foreigner, in giving him food and clothing.

010:019 Therefore love the foreigner; for you were foreigners in

        the land of Egypt.

010:020 You shall fear Yahweh your God; him shall you serve;

        and to him shall you cleave, and by his name shall you swear.

010:021 He is your praise, and he is your God, who has done for you

        these great and awesome things, which your eyes have seen.

010:022 Your fathers went down into Egypt with seventy persons;

        and now Yahweh your God has made you as the stars of the

        sky for multitude.

011:001 Therefore you shall love Yahweh your God, and keep his charge,

        and his statutes, and his ordinances, and his commandments, always.

011:002 Know you this day:  for I don't speak with your children

        who have not known, and who have not seen the chastisement

        of Yahweh your God, his greatness, his mighty hand,

        and his outstretched arm,

011:003 and his signs, and his works, which he did in the midst of Egypt

        to Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and to all his land;

011:004 and what he did to the army of Egypt, to their horses, and to

        their chariots; how he made the water of the Red Sea{or, Sea of

        Reeds} to overflow them as they pursued after you, and how

        Yahweh has destroyed them to this day;

011:005 and what he did to you in the wilderness, until you came

        to this place;

011:006 and what he did to Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab,

        the son of Reuben; how the earth opened its mouth,

        and swallowed them up, and their households, and their tents,

        and every living thing that followed them, in the midst

        of all Israel:

011:007 but your eyes have seen all the great work of Yahweh which he did.

011:008 Therefore shall you keep all the commandment which I command

        you this day, that you may be strong, and go in and possess

        the land, where you go over to possess it;

011:009 and that you may prolong your days in the land, which Yahweh

        swore to your fathers to give to them and to their seed,

        a land flowing with milk and honey.

011:010 For the land, where you go in to possess it, isn't as the land

        of Egypt, from whence you came out, where you sowed your seed,

        and watered it with your foot, as a garden of herbs;

011:011 but the land, where you go over to possess it, is a land of hills

        and valleys, [and] drinks water of the rain of the sky,

011:012 a land which Yahweh your God cares for:  the eyes of Yahweh

        your God are always on it, from the beginning of the year

        even to the end of the year.

011:013 It shall happen, if you shall listen diligently to my commandments

        which I command you this day, to love Yahweh your God,

        and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul,

011:014 that I will give the rain of your land in its season, the former

        rain and the latter rain, that you may gather in your grain,

        and your new wine, and your oil.

011:015 I will give grass in your fields for your livestock, and you

        shall eat and be full.

011:016 Take heed to yourselves, lest your heart be deceived, and you

        turn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them;

011:017 and the anger of Yahweh be kindled against you, and he shut

        up the sky, so that there shall be no rain, and the land

        shall not yield its fruit; and you perish quickly from off

        the good land which Yahweh gives you.

011:018 Therefore shall you lay up these my words in your heart and in

        your soul; and you shall bind them for a sign on your hand,

        and they shall be for symbols between your eyes.

011:019 You shall teach them your children, talking of them,

        when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way,

        and when you lie down, and when you rise up.

011:020 You shall write them on the door posts of your house,

        and on your gates;

011:021 that your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children,

        in the land which Yahweh swore to your fathers to give them,

        as the days of the heavens above the earth.

011:022 For if you shall diligently keep all this commandment which I

        command you, to do it, to love Yahweh your God, to walk

        in all his ways, and to cleave to him;

011:023 then will Yahweh drive out all these nations from before you, and you

        shall dispossess nations greater and mightier than yourselves.

011:024 Every place whereon the sole of your foot shall tread shall

        be yours:  from the wilderness, and Lebanon, from the river,

        the river Euphrates, even to the hinder sea shall be your border.

011:025 There shall no man be able to stand before you:

        Yahweh your God shall lay the fear of you and the dread

        of you on all the land that you shall tread on, as he has

        spoken to you.

011:026 Behold, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse:

011:027 the blessing, if you shall listen to the commandments of Yahweh

        your God, which I command you this day;

011:028 and the curse, if you shall not listen to the commandments

        of Yahweh your God, but turn aside out of the way which I

        command you this day, to go after other gods, which you

        have not known.

011:029 It shall happen, when Yahweh your God shall bring you into

        the land where you go to possess it, that you shall set

        the blessing on Mount Gerizim, and the curse on Mount Ebal.

011:030 Aren't they beyond the Jordan, behind the way of the going

        down of the sun, in the land of the Canaanites who dwell

        in the Arabah, over against Gilgal, beside the oaks of Moreh?

011:031 For you are to pass over the Jordan to go in to possess the land

        which Yahweh your God gives you, and you shall possess it,

        and dwell therein.

011:032 You shall observe to do all the statutes and the ordinances

        which I set before you this day.

012:001 These are the statutes and the ordinances which you shall observe

        to do in the land which Yahweh, the God of your fathers,

        has given you to possess it, all the days that you live

        on the earth.

012:002 You shall surely destroy all the places in which the nations that

        you shall dispossess served their gods, on the high mountains,

        and on the hills, and under every green tree:

012:003 and you shall break down their altars, and dash in pieces

        their pillars, and burn their Asherim with fire;

        and you shall cut down the engraved images of their gods;

        and you shall destroy their name out of that place.

012:004 You shall not do so to Yahweh your God.

012:005 But to the place which Yahweh your God shall choose out of all

        your tribes, to put his name there, even to his habitation

        shall you seek, and there you shall come;

012:006 and there you shall bring your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices,

        and your tithes, and the wave offering of your hand,

        and your vows, and your freewill offerings, and the firstborn

        of your herd and of your flock:

012:007 and there you shall eat before Yahweh your God, and you shall

        rejoice in all that you put your hand to, you and your households,

        in which Yahweh your God has blessed you.

012:008 You shall not do after all the things that we do here this day,

        every man whatever is right in his own eyes;

012:009 for you haven't yet come to the rest and to the inheritance,

        which Yahweh your God gives you.

012:010 But when you go over the Jordan, and dwell in the land which

        Yahweh your God causes you to inherit, and he gives you rest

        from all your enemies round about, so that you dwell in safety;

012:011 then it shall happen that to the place which Yahweh your God

        shall choose, to cause his name to dwell there, there shall

        you bring all that I command you:  your burnt offerings,

        and your sacrifices, your tithes, and the wave offering of

        your hand, and all your choice vows which you vow to Yahweh.

012:012 You shall rejoice before Yahweh your God, you, and your sons,

        and your daughters, and your male servants, and your

        female servants, and the Levite who is within your gates,

        because he has no portion nor inheritance with you.

012:013 Take heed to yourself that you don't offer your burnt offerings

        in every place that you see;

012:014 but in the place which Yahweh shall choose in one of your tribes,

        there you shall offer your burnt offerings, and there you

        shall do all that I command you.

012:015 Notwithstanding, you may kill and eat flesh within all

        your gates, after all the desire of your soul, according to

        the blessing of Yahweh your God which he has given you:

        the unclean and the clean may eat of it, as of the gazelle,

        and as of the hart.

012:016 Only you shall not eat the blood; you shall pour it out on

        the earth as water.

012:017 You may not eat within your gates the tithe of your grain,

        or of your new wine, or of your oil, or the firstborn of your

        herd or of your flock, nor any of your vows which you vow,

        nor your freewill offerings, nor the wave offering of your hand;

012:018 but you shall eat them before Yahweh your God in the place

        which Yahweh your God shall choose, you, and your son,

        and your daughter, and your male servant, and your

        female servant, and the Levite who is within your gates:

        and you shall rejoice before Yahweh your God in all that you

        put your hand to.

012:019 Take heed to yourself that you don't forsake the Levite as long

        as you live in your land.

012:020 When Yahweh your God shall enlarge your border, as he has

        promised you, and you shall say, I will eat flesh,

        because your soul desires to eat flesh; you may eat flesh,

        after all the desire of your soul.

012:021 If the place which Yahweh your God shall choose, to put

        his name there, be too far from you, then you shall kill

        of your herd and of your flock, which Yahweh has given you,

        as I have commanded you; and you may eat within your gates,

        after all the desire of your soul.

012:022 Even as the gazelle and as the hart is eaten, so you shall eat of it:

        the unclean and the clean may eat of it alike.

012:023 Only be sure that you don't eat the blood:  for the blood

        is the life; and you shall not eat the life with the flesh.

012:024 You shall not eat it; you shall pour it out on the earth as water.

012:025 You shall not eat it; that it may go well with you, and with

        your children after you, when you shall do that which is

        right in the eyes of Yahweh.

012:026 Only your holy things which you have, and your vows, you shall take,

        and go to the place which Yahweh shall choose:

012:027 and you shall offer your burnt offerings, the flesh and the blood,

        on the altar of Yahweh your God; and the blood of your

        sacrifices shall be poured out on the altar of Yahweh your God;

        and you shall eat the flesh.

012:028 Observe and hear all these words which I command you, that it

        may go well with you, and with your children after you forever,

        when you do that which is good and right in the eyes of

        Yahweh your God.

012:029 When Yahweh your God shall cut off the nations from before you,

        where you go in to dispossess them, and you dispossess them,

        and dwell in their land;

012:030 take heed to yourself that you not be ensnared to follow them,

        after that they are destroyed from before you; and that you

        not inquire after their gods, saying, How do these nations

        serve their gods? even so will I do likewise.

012:031 You shall not do so to Yahweh your God:  for every abomination

        to Yahweh, which he hates, have they done to their gods;

        for even their sons and their daughters do they burn in the fire

        to their gods.

012:032 Whatever thing I command you, that shall you observe to do:

        you shall not add thereto, nor diminish from it.

013:001 If there arise in the midst of you a prophet, or a dreamer

        of dreams, and he give you a sign or a wonder,

013:002 and the sign or the wonder come to pass, of which he spoke

        to you, saying, Let us go after other gods, which you have

        not known, and let us serve them;

013:003 you shall not listen to the words of that prophet, or to

        that dreamer of dreams:  for Yahweh your God proves you,

        to know whether you love Yahweh your God with all your heart

        and with all your soul.

013:004 You shall walk after Yahweh your God, and fear him, and keep

        his commandments, and obey his voice, and you shall serve him,

        and cleave to him.

013:005 That prophet, or that dreamer of dreams, shall be put to death,

        because he has spoken rebellion against Yahweh your God,

        who brought you out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed

        you out of the house of bondage, to draw you aside out

        of the way which Yahweh your God commanded you to walk in.

        So shall you put away the evil from the midst of you.

013:006 If your brother, the son of your mother, or your son,

        or your daughter, or the wife of your bosom, or your friend,

        who is as your own soul, entice you secretly, saying, Let us

        go and serve other gods, which you have not known, you,

        nor your fathers;

013:007 of the gods of the peoples who are round about you, near to you,

        or far off from you, from the one end of the earth even

        to the other end of the earth;

013:008 you shall not consent to him, nor listen to him; neither shall

        your eye pity him, neither shall you spare, neither shall

        you conceal him:

013:009 but you shall surely kill him; your hand shall be first on him

        to put him to death, and afterwards the hand of all the people.

013:010 You shall stone him to death with stones, because he has

        sought to draw you away from Yahweh your God, who brought

        you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.

013:011 All Israel shall hear, and fear, and shall not do any more

        such wickedness as this is in the midst of you.

013:012 If you shall hear tell concerning one of your cities,

        which Yahweh your God gives you to dwell there, saying,

013:013 Certain base fellows are gone out from the midst of you,

        and have drawn away the inhabitants of their city, saying, Let us

        go and serve other gods, which you have not known;

013:014 then shall you inquire, and make search, and ask diligently;

        and, behold, if it be truth, and the thing certain,

        that such abomination is done in the midst of you,

013:015 you shall surely strike the inhabitants of that city with the edge

        of the sword, destroying it utterly, and all that is therein

        and the livestock of it, with the edge of the sword.

013:016 You shall gather all the spoil of it into the midst

        of the street of it, and shall burn with fire the city,

        and all the spoil of it every whit, to Yahweh your God:

        and it shall be a heap forever; it shall not be built again.

013:017 There shall cleave nothing of the devoted thing to your hand;

        that Yahweh may turn from the fierceness of his anger,

        and show you mercy, and have compassion on you, and multiply you,

        as he has sworn to your fathers;

013:018 when you shall listen to the voice of Yahweh your God,

        to keep all his commandments which I command you this day,

        to do that which is right in the eyes of Yahweh your God.

014:001 You are the children of Yahweh your God:  you shall not

        cut yourselves, nor make any baldness between your eyes

        for the dead.

014:002 For you are a holy people to Yahweh your God, and Yahweh

        has chosen you to be a people for his own possession,

        above all peoples who are on the face of the earth.

014:003 You shall not eat any abominable thing.

014:004 These are the animals which you may eat:  the ox, the sheep,

        and the goat,

014:005 the hart, and the gazelle, and the roebuck, and the wild goat,

        and the ibex, and the antelope, and the chamois.

014:006 Every animal that parts the hoof, and has the hoof cloven in two,

        [and] chews the cud, among the animals, that may you eat.

014:007 Nevertheless these you shall not eat of them that chew the cud,

        or of those who have the hoof cloven:  the camel, and the hare,

        and the rabbit; because they chew the cud but don't part the hoof,

        they are unclean to you.

014:008 The pig, because it has a split hoof but doesn't chew the cud,

        is unclean to you:  of their flesh you shall not eat,

        and their carcasses you shall not touch.

014:009 These you may eat of all that are in the waters:

        whatever has fins and scales may you eat;

014:010 and whatever doesn't have fins and scales you shall not eat;

        it is unclean to you.

014:011 Of all clean birds you may eat.

014:012 But these are they of which you shall not eat:  the eagle,

        and the vulture, and the osprey,

014:013 and the red kite, and the falcon, and the kite after its kind,

014:014 and every raven after its kind,

014:015 and the ostrich, and the owl, and the seagull, and the hawk

        after its kind,

014:016 the little owl, and the great owl, and the horned owl,

014:017 and the pelican, and the vulture, and the cormorant,

014:018 and the stork, and the heron after its kind, and the hoopoe,

        and the bat.

014:019 All winged creeping things are unclean to you:  they shall

        not be eaten.

014:020 Of all clean birds you may eat.

014:021 You shall not eat of anything that dies of itself:

        you may give it to the foreigner living among you who is

        within your gates, that he may eat it; or you may sell it

        to a foreigner:  for you are a holy people to Yahweh your God.

        You shall not boil a kid in its mother's milk.

014:022 You shall surely tithe all the increase of your seed,

        that which comes forth from the field year by year.

014:023 You shall eat before Yahweh your God, in the place

        which he shall choose, to cause his name to dwell there,

        the tithe of your grain, of your new wine, and of your oil,

        and the firstborn of your herd and of your flock; that you

        may learn to fear Yahweh your God always.

014:024 If the way be too long for you, so that you are not able

        to carry it, because the place is too far from you,

        which Yahweh your God shall choose, to set his name there,

        when Yahweh your God shall bless you;

014:025 then shall you turn it into money, and bind up the money

        in your hand, and shall go to the place which Yahweh your

        God shall choose:

014:026 and you shall bestow the money for whatever your soul desires,

        for oxen, or for sheep, or for wine, or for strong drink,

        or for whatever your soul asks of you; and you shall eat

        there before Yahweh your God, and you shall rejoice,

        you and your household.

014:027 The Levite who is within your gates, you shall not forsake him;

        for he has no portion nor inheritance with you.

014:028 At the end of every three years you shall bring forth all

        the tithe of your increase in the same year, and shall lay

        it up within your gates:

014:029 and the Levite, because he has no portion nor inheritance with you,

        and the foreigner living among you, and the fatherless,

        and the widow, who are within your gates, shall come,

        and shall eat and be satisfied; that Yahweh your God may bless

        you in all the work of your hand which you do.

015:001 At the end of every seven years you shall make a release.

015:002 This is the manner of the release:  every creditor

        shall release that which he has lent to his neighbor;

        he shall not exact it of his neighbor and his brother;

        because Yahweh's release has been proclaimed.

015:003 Of a foreigner you may exact it:  but whatever of your is

        with your brother your hand shall release.

015:004 However there shall be no poor with you; (for Yahweh will

        surely bless you in the land which Yahweh your God gives you

        for an inheritance to possess it;)

015:005 if only you diligently listen to the voice of Yahweh your God,

        to observe to do all this commandment which I command

        you this day.

015:006 For Yahweh your God will bless you, as he promised you:

        and you shall lend to many nations, but you shall not borrow;

        and you shall rule over many nations, but they shall not

        rule over you.

015:007 If there be with you a poor man, one of your brothers,

        within any of your gates in your land which Yahweh your God

        gives you, you shall not harden your heart, nor shut your hand

        from your poor brother;

015:008 but you shall surely open your hand to him, and shall surely

        lend him sufficient for his need [in that] which he wants.

015:009 Beware that there not be a base thought in your heart, saying,

        The seventh year, the year of release, is at hand; and your eye

        be evil against your poor brother, and you give him nothing;

        and he cry to Yahweh against you, and it be sin to you.

015:010 You shall surely give him, and your heart shall not be grieved

        when you give to him; because that for this thing Yahweh

        your God will bless you in all your work, and in all that you

        put your hand to.

015:011 For the poor will never cease out of the land:

        therefore I command you, saying, You shall surely open

        your hand to your brother, to your needy, and to your poor,

        in your land.

015:012 If your brother, a Hebrew man, or a Hebrew woman, be sold to you,

        and serve you six years; then in the seventh year you shall

        let him go free from you.

015:013 When you let him go free from you, you shall not let him go empty:

015:014 you shall furnish him liberally out of your flock,

        and out of your threshing floor, and out of your winepress;

        as Yahweh your God has blessed you, you shall give to him.

015:015 You shall remember that you were a bondservant in the land

        of Egypt, and Yahweh your God redeemed you:  therefore I

        command you this thing today.

015:016 It shall be, if he tell you, I will not go out from you;

        because he loves you and your house, because he is well with you;

015:017 then you shall take an awl, and thrust it through his ear

        to the door, and he shall be your servant forever.

        Also to your female servant you shall do likewise.

015:018 It shall not seem hard to you, when you let him go free from you;

        for to the double of the hire of a hireling has he served

        you six years:  and Yahweh your God will bless you in all

        that you do.

015:019 All the firstborn males that are born of your herd and

        of your flock you shall sanctify to Yahweh your God:

        you shall do no work with the firstborn of your herd,

        nor shear the firstborn of your flock.

015:020 You shall eat it before Yahweh your God year by year in the place

        which Yahweh shall choose, you and your household.

015:021 If it have any blemish, [as if it be] lame or blind, any ill

        blemish whatever, you shall not sacrifice it to Yahweh your God.

015:022 You shall eat it within your gates:  the unclean and the clean

        [shall eat it] alike, as the gazelle, and as the hart.

015:023 Only you shall not eat its blood; you shall pour it out on

        the ground as water.

016:001 Observe the month of Abib, and keep the Passover to Yahweh your God;

        for in the month of Abib Yahweh your God brought you forth

        out of Egypt by night.

016:002 You shall sacrifice the Passover to Yahweh your God, of the flock

        and the herd, in the place which Yahweh shall choose,

        to cause his name to dwell there.

016:003 You shall eat no leavened bread with it; seven days shall you

        eat unleavened bread therewith, even the bread of affliction;

        for you came forth out of the land of Egypt in haste:

        that you may remember the day when you came forth out of the land

        of Egypt all the days of your life.

016:004 There shall be no yeast seen with you in all your borders

        seven days; neither shall any of the flesh, which you sacrifice

        the first day at even, remain all night until the morning.

016:005 You may not sacrifice the Passover within any of your gates,

        which Yahweh your God gives you;

016:006 but at the place which Yahweh your God shall choose, to cause

        his name to dwell in, there you shall sacrifice the Passover

        at even, at the going down of the sun, at the season that you

        came forth out of Egypt.

016:007 You shall roast and eat it in the place which Yahweh your God

        shall choose:  and you shall turn in the morning, and go

        to your tents.

016:008 Six days you shall eat unleavened bread; and on the seventh

        day shall be a solemn assembly to Yahweh your God; you shall

        do no work [therein].

016:009 Seven weeks shall you number to you:  from the time you begin

        to put the sickle to the standing grain shall you begin

        to number seven weeks.

016:010 You shall keep the feast of weeks to Yahweh your God with a tribute

        of a freewill offering of your hand, which you shall give,

        according as Yahweh your God blesses you:

016:011 and you shall rejoice before Yahweh your God, you, and your son,

        and your daughter, and your male servant, and your female servant,

        and the Levite who is within your gates, and the foreigner,

        and the fatherless, and the widow, who are in the midst of you,

        in the place which Yahweh your God shall choose, to cause

        his name to dwell there.

016:012 You shall remember that you were a bondservant in Egypt:

        and you shall observe and do these statutes.

016:013 You shall keep the feast of tents seven days, after that you have

        gathered in from your threshing floor and from your winepress:

016:014 and you shall rejoice in your feast, you, and your son,

        and your daughter, and your male servant, and your female servant,

        and the Levite, and the foreigner, and the fatherless,

        and the widow, who are within your gates.

016:015 Seven days shall you keep a feast to Yahweh your God in the place

        which Yahweh shall choose; because Yahweh your God will bless

        you in all your increase, and in all the work of your hands,

        and you shall be altogether joyful.

016:016 Three times in a year shall all your males appear before

        Yahweh your God in the place which he shall choose:

        in the feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks,

        and in the feast of tents; and they shall not appear

        before Yahweh empty:

016:017 every man shall give as he is able, according to the blessing

        of Yahweh your God which he has given you.

016:018 Judges and officers shall you make you in all your gates,

        which Yahweh your God gives you, according to your tribes;

        and they shall judge the people with righteous judgment.

016:019 You shall not wrest justice:  you shall not respect persons;

        neither shall you take a bribe; for a bribe does blind the eyes

        of the wise, and pervert the words of the righteous.

016:020 That which is altogether just shall you follow, that you may live,

        and inherit the land which Yahweh your God gives you.

016:021 You shall not plant you an Asherah of any kind of tree beside

        the altar of Yahweh your God, which you shall make you.

016:022 Neither shall you set yourself up a pillar; which Yahweh

        your God hates.

017:001 You shall not sacrifice to Yahweh your God an ox, or a sheep,

        in which is a blemish, [or] anything evil; for that is an

        abomination to Yahweh your God.

017:002 If there be found in the midst of you, within any of your

        gates which Yahweh your God gives you, man or woman,

        who does that which is evil in the sight of Yahweh your God,

        in transgressing his covenant,

017:003 and has gone and served other gods, and worshiped them,

        or the sun, or the moon, or any of the army of the sky,

        which I have not commanded;

017:004 and it be told you, and you have heard of it, then shall you

        inquire diligently; and behold, if it be true, and the thing certain,

        that such abomination is done in Israel,

017:005 then shall you bring forth that man or that woman, who has done

        this evil thing, to your gates, even the man or the woman;

        and you shall stone them to death with stones.

017:006 At the mouth of two witnesses, or three witnesses, shall he who is

        to die be put to death; at the mouth of one witness he shall

        not be put to death.

017:007 The hand of the witnesses shall be first on him to put

        him to death, and afterward the hand of all the people.

        So you shall put away the evil from the midst of you.

017:008 If there arise a matter too hard for you in judgment,

        between blood and blood, between plea and plea, and between stroke

        and stroke, being matters of controversy within your gates;

        then shall you arise, and go up to the place which Yahweh

        your God shall choose;

017:009 and you shall come to the priests the Levites, and to the judge

        who shall be in those days:  and you shall inquire;

        and they shall show you the sentence of judgment.

017:010 You shall do according to the tenor of the sentence which they

        shall show you from that place which Yahweh shall choose;

        and you shall observe to do according to all that they

        shall teach you:

017:011 according to the tenor of the law which they shall teach you,

        and according to the judgment which they shall tell you,

        you shall do; you shall not turn aside from the sentence

        which they shall show you, to the right hand, nor to the left.

017:012 The man who does presumptuously, in not listening to the priest

        who stands to minister there before Yahweh your God,

        or to the judge, even that man shall die:  and you shall put

        away the evil from Israel.

017:013 All the people shall hear, and fear, and do no more presumptuously.

017:014 When you are come to the land which Yahweh your God gives you,

        and shall possess it, and shall dwell therein, and shall say,

        I will set a king over me, like all the nations that are

        round about me;

017:015 you shall surely set him king over you, whom Yahweh your

        God shall choose:  one from among your brothers shall you

        set king over you; you may not put a foreigner over you,

        who is not your brother.

017:016 Only he shall not multiply horses to himself, nor cause the people

        to return to Egypt, to the end that he may multiply horses;

        because Yahweh has said to you, You shall henceforth return

        no more that way.

017:017 Neither shall he multiply wives to himself, that his heart

        not turn away:  neither shall he greatly multiply to himself

        silver and gold.

017:018 It shall be, when he sits on the throne of his kingdom,

        that he shall write him a copy of this law in a book,

        out of [that which is] before the priests the Levites:

017:019 and it shall be with him, and he shall read therein all the days

        of his life; that he may learn to fear Yahweh his God,

        to keep all the words of this law and these statutes,

        to do them;

017:020 that his heart not be lifted up above his brothers, and that he not

        turn aside from the commandment, to the right hand, or to the left:

        to the end that he may prolong his days in his kingdom,

        he and his children, in the midst of Israel.

018:001 The priests the Levites, [even] all the tribe of Levi,

        shall have no portion nor inheritance with Israel:

        they shall eat the offerings of Yahweh made by fire,

        and his inheritance.

018:002 They shall have no inheritance among their brothers:

        Yahweh is their inheritance, as he has spoken to them.

018:003 This shall be the priests' due from the people, from those

        who offer a sacrifice, whether it be ox or sheep, that they

        shall give to the priest the shoulder, and the two cheeks,

        and the maw.

018:004 The first fruits of your grain, of your new wine, and of your oil,

        and the first of the fleece of your sheep, shall you give him.

018:005 For Yahweh your God has chosen him out of all your tribes,

        to stand to minister in the name of Yahweh, him and his

        sons for ever.

018:006 If a Levite comes from any of your gates out of all Israel,

        where he lives as a foreigner, and comes with all the desire

        of his soul to the place which Yahweh shall choose;

018:007 then he shall minister in the name of Yahweh his God, as all

        his brothers the Levites do, who stand there before Yahweh.

018:008 They shall have like portions to eat, besides that which comes

        of the sale of his patrimony.

018:009 When you are come into the land which Yahweh your God gives you,

        you shall not learn to do after the abominations of those nations.

018:010 There shall not be found with you anyone who makes his son or his

        daughter to pass through the fire, one who uses divination,

        one who practices sorcery, or an enchanter, or a sorcerer,

018:011 or a charmer, or a consulter with a familiar spirit, or a wizard,

        or a necromancer.

018:012 For whoever does these things is an abomination to Yahweh:

        and because of these abominations Yahweh your God does drive

        them out from before you.

018:013 You shall be perfect with Yahweh your God.

018:014 For these nations, that you shall dispossess, listen to those

        who practice sorcery, and to diviners; but as for you,

        Yahweh your God has not allowed you so to do.

018:015 Yahweh your God will raise up to you a prophet from the midst

        of you, of your brothers, like me; to him you shall listen;

018:016 according to all that you desired of Yahweh your God in Horeb

        in the day of the assembly, saying, Let me not hear again

        the voice of Yahweh my God, neither let me see this great fire

        any more, that I not die.

018:017 Yahweh said to me, They have well said that which they have spoken.

018:018 I will raise them up a prophet from among their brothers,

        like you; and I will put my words in his mouth, and he shall

        speak to them all that I shall command him.

018:019 It shall happen, that whoever will not listen to my words

        which he shall speak in my name, I will require it of him.

018:020 But the prophet, who shall speak a word presumptuously in my name,

        which I have not commanded him to speak, or who shall speak

        in the name of other gods, that same prophet shall die.

018:021 If you say in your heart, How shall we know the word which Yahweh

        has not spoken?

018:022 when a prophet speaks in the name of Yahweh, if the thing

        doesn't follow, nor happen, that is the thing which Yahweh

        has not spoken:  the prophet has spoken it presumptuously,

        you shall not be afraid of him.

019:001 When Yahweh your God shall cut off the nations, whose land

        Yahweh your God gives you, and you succeed them, and dwell

        in their cities, and in their houses;

019:002 you shall set apart three cities for you in the midst of your land,

        which Yahweh your God gives you to possess it.

019:003 You shall prepare you the way, and divide the borders of your land,

        which Yahweh your God causes you to inherit, into three parts,

        that every manslayer may flee there.

019:004 This is the case of the manslayer, that shall flee there and live:

        whoever kills his neighbor unawares, and didn't hate him

        in time past;

019:005 as when a man goes into the forest with his neighbor to hew wood,

        and his hand fetches a stroke with the axe to cut down the tree,

        and the head slips from the handle, and lights on his neighbor,

        so that he dies; he shall flee to one of these cities and live:

019:006 lest the avenger of blood pursue the manslayer, while his

        heart is hot, and overtake him, because the way is long,

        and strike him mortally; whereas he was not worthy of death,

        inasmuch as he didn't hate him in time past.

019:007 Therefore I command you, saying, You shall set apart three

        cities for you.

019:008 If Yahweh your God enlarge your border, as he has sworn

        to your fathers, and give you all the land which he promised

        to give to your fathers;

019:009 if you shall keep all this commandment to do it, which I command

        you this day, to love Yahweh your God, and to walk ever

        in his ways; then shall you add three cities more for you,

        besides these three:

019:010 that innocent blood not be shed in the midst of your land,

        which Yahweh your God gives you for an inheritance,

        and so blood be on you.

019:011 But if any man hate his neighbor, and lie in wait for him,

        and rise up against him, and strike him mortally so that he dies,

        and he flee into one of these cities;

019:012 then the elders of his city shall send and bring him there,

        and deliver him into the hand of the avenger of blood,

        that he may die.

019:013 Your eye shall not pity him, but you shall put away the innocent

        blood from Israel, that it may go well with you.

019:014 You shall not remove your neighbor's landmark, which they of old

        time have set, in your inheritance which you shall inherit,

        in the land that Yahweh your God gives you to possess it.

019:015 One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity,

        or for any sin, in any sin that he sins:  at the mouth

        of two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses,

        shall a matter be established.

019:016 If an unrighteous witness rise up against any man to testify

        against him of wrong-doing,

019:017 then both the men, between whom the controversy is, shall stand

        before Yahweh, before the priests and the judges who shall

        be in those days;

019:018 and the judges shall make diligent inquisition:  and, behold,

        if the witness is a false witness, and has testified falsely

        against his brother;

019:019 then shall you do to him, as he had thought to do to his brother:

        so shall you put away the evil from the midst of you.

019:020 Those who remain shall hear, and fear, and shall henceforth

        commit no more any such evil in the midst of you.

019:021 Your eyes shall not pity; life [shall go] for life, eye for eye,

        tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.

020:001 When you go forth to battle against your enemies, and see horses,

        and chariots, [and] a people more than you, you shall

        not be afraid of them; for Yahweh your God is with you,

        who brought you up out of the land of Egypt.

020:002 It shall be, when you draw near to the battle, that the priest

        shall approach and speak to the people,

020:003 and shall tell them, Hear, Israel, you draw near this day

        to battle against your enemies:  don't let your heart faint;

        don't be afraid, nor tremble, neither be scared of them;

020:004 for Yahweh your God is he who goes with you, to fight for you

        against your enemies, to save you.

020:005 The officers shall speak to the people, saying, What man is

        there who has built a new house, and has not dedicated it? let

        him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle,

        and another man dedicate it.

020:006 What man is there who has planted a vineyard, and has not

        used the fruit of it? let him go and return to his house,

        lest he die in the battle, and another man use the fruit of it.

020:007 What man is there who has pledged to be married a wife,

        and has not taken her? let him go and return to his house,

        lest he die in the battle, and another man take her.

020:008 The officers shall speak further to the people, and they shall say,

        What man is there who is fearful and faint-hearted? let him

        go and return to his house, lest his brother's heart melt

        as his heart.

020:009 It shall be, when the officers have made an end of speaking

        to the people, that they shall appoint captains of armies

        at the head of the people.

020:010 When you draw near to a city to fight against it, then proclaim

        peace to it.

020:011 It shall be, if it make you answer of peace, and open to you,

        then it shall be, that all the people who are found therein

        shall become tributary to you, and shall serve you.

020:012 If it will make no peace with you, but will make war against you,

        then you shall besiege it:

020:013 and when Yahweh your God delivers it into your hand, you shall

        strike every male of it with the edge of the sword:

020:014 but the women, and the little ones, and the livestock,

        and all that is in the city, even all the spoil of it,

        shall you take for a prey to yourself; and you shall eat

        the spoil of your enemies, which Yahweh your God has given you.

020:015 Thus shall you do to all the cities which are very far off

        from you, which are not of the cities of these nations.

020:016 But of the cities of these peoples, that Yahweh your God gives you

        for an inheritance, you shall save alive nothing that breathes;

020:017 but you shall utterly destroy them:  the Hittite, and the Amorite,

        the Canaanite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite;

        as Yahweh your God has commanded you;

020:018 that they not teach you to do after all their abominations,

        which they have done to their gods; so would you sin against

        Yahweh your God.

020:019 When you shall besiege a city a long time, in making war

        against it to take it, you shall not destroy the trees of it

        by wielding an axe against them; for you may eat of them,

        and you shall not cut them down; for is the tree of the field man,

        that it should be besieged of you?

020:020 Only the trees of which you know that they are not trees

        for food, you shall destroy and cut them down; and you shall

        build bulwarks against the city that makes war with you,

        until it fall.

021:001 If one be found slain in the land which Yahweh your God gives

        you to possess it, lying in the field, and it isn't known

        who has struck him;

021:002 then your elders and your judges shall come forth, and they shall

        measure to the cities which are round about him who is slain:

021:003 and it shall be, that the city which is nearest to the slain man,

        even the elders of that city shall take a heifer of the herd,

        which hasn't been worked with, and which has not drawn

        in the yoke;

021:004 and the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer to a

        valley with running water, which is neither plowed nor sown,

        and shall break the heifer's neck there in the valley.

021:005 The priests the sons of Levi shall come near; for them Yahweh

        your God has chosen to minister to him, and to bless in the name

        of Yahweh; and according to their word shall every controversy

        and every stroke be.

021:006 All the elders of that city, who are nearest to the slain man,

        shall wash their hands over the heifer whose neck was broken

        in the valley;

021:007 and they shall answer and say, Our hands have not shed this blood,

        neither have our eyes seen it.

021:008 Forgive, Yahweh, your people Israel, whom you have redeemed,

        and don't allow innocent blood [to remain] in the midst

        of your people Israel.  The blood shall be forgiven them.

021:009 So shall you put away the innocent blood from the midst of you,

        when you shall do that which is right in the eyes of Yahweh.

021:010 When you go forth to battle against your enemies, and Yahweh

        your God delivers them into your hands, and you carry

        them away captive,

021:011 and see among the captives a beautiful woman, and you have

        a desire to her, and would take her to you as wife;

021:012 then you shall bring her home to your house; and she shall

        shave her head, and pare her nails;

021:013 and she shall put the clothing of her captivity from off her,

        and shall remain in your house, and bewail her father and her

        mother a full month:  and after that you shall go in to her,

        and be her husband, and she shall be your wife.

021:014 It shall be, if you have no delight in her, then you shall

        let her go where she will; but you shall not sell her at

        all for money, you shall not deal with her as a slave,

        because you have humbled her.

021:015 If a man have two wives, the one beloved, and the other hated,

        and they have borne him children, both the beloved and the hated;

        and if the firstborn son be hers who was hated;

021:016 then it shall be, in the day that he causes his sons

        to inherit that which he has, that he may not make the son

        of the beloved the firstborn before the son of the hated,

        who is the firstborn:

021:017 but he shall acknowledge the firstborn, the son of the hated,

        by giving him a double portion of all that he has; for he is

        the beginning of his strength; the right of the firstborn is his.

021:018 If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, who will not obey

        the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and,

        though they chasten him, will not listen to them;

021:019 then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him,

        and bring him out to the elders of his city, and to the gate

        of his place;

021:020 and they shall tell the elders of his city, This our son

        is stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our voice;

        he is a glutton, and a drunkard.

021:021 All the men of his city shall stone him to death with stones:

        so shall you put away the evil from the midst of you;

        and all Israel shall hear, and fear.

021:022 If a man have committed a sin worthy of death, and he be put

        to death, and you hang him on a tree;

021:023 his body shall not remain all night on the tree, but you shall

        surely bury him the same day; for he who is hanged is accursed

        of God; that you don't defile your land which Yahweh your God

        gives you for an inheritance.

022:001 You shall not see your brother's ox or his sheep go astray,

        and hide yourself from them:  you shall surely bring them

        again to your brother.

022:002 If your brother isn't near to you, or if you don't know him,

        then you shall bring it home to your house, and it shall

        be with you until your brother seek after it, and you shall

        restore it to him.

022:003 So shall you do with his donkey; and so shall you do with

        his garment; and so shall you do with every lost thing

        of your brother's, which he has lost, and you have found:

        you may not hide yourself.

022:004 You shall not see your brother's donkey or his ox

        fallen down by the way, and hide yourself from them:

        you shall surely help him to lift them up again.

022:005 A woman shall not wear men's clothing, neither shall a man

        put on women's clothing; for whoever does these things is

        an abomination to Yahweh your God.

022:006 If a bird's nest chance to be before you in the way,

        in any tree or on the ground, with young ones or eggs,

        and the hen sitting on the young, or on the eggs, you shall

        not take the hen with the young:

022:007 you shall surely let the hen go, but the young you may take

        to yourself; that it may be well with you, and that you may

        prolong your days.

022:008 When you build a new house, then you shall make a battlement

        for your roof, that you don't bring blood on your house,

        if any man fall from there.

022:009 You shall not sow your vineyard with two kinds of seed,

        lest the whole fruit be forfeited, the seed which you have sown,

        and the increase of the vineyard.

022:010 You shall not plow with an ox and a donkey together.

022:011 You shall not wear a mixed stuff, wool and linen together.

022:012 You shall make yourselves fringes{or, tassles} on the four

        borders of your cloak, with which you cover yourself.

022:013 If any man takes a wife, and goes in to her, and hates her,

022:014 and accuses her of shameful things, and brings up an evil name

        on her, and says, I took this woman, and when I came near to her,

        I didn't find in her the tokens of virginity;

022:015 then shall the father of the young lady, and her mother,

        take and bring forth the tokens of the young lady's virginity

        to the elders of the city in the gate;

022:016 and the young lady's father shall tell the elders, I gave

        my daughter to this man to wife, and he hates her;

022:017 and behold, he has laid shameful things [to her charge], saying,

        I didn't find in your daughter the tokens of virginity;

        and yet these are the tokens of my daughter's virginity.

        They shall spread the garment before the elders of the city.

022:018 The elders of that city shall take the man and chastise him;

022:019 and they shall fine him one hundred [shekels] of silver,

        and give them to the father of the young lady, because he has

        brought up an evil name on a virgin of Israel:  and she shall

        be his wife; he may not put her away all his days.

022:020 But if this thing be true, that the tokens of virginity were

        not found in the young lady;

022:021 then they shall bring out the young lady to the door

        of her father's house, and the men of her city shall stone

        her to death with stones, because she has done folly

        in Israel, to play the prostitute in her father's house:

        so shall you put away the evil from the midst of you.

022:022 If a man be found lying with a woman married to a husband,

        then they shall both of them die, the man who lay with the woman,

        and the woman:  so shall you put away the evil from Israel.

022:023 If there be a young lady who is a virgin pledged to be married

        to a husband, and a man find her in the city, and lie with her;

022:024 then you shall bring them both out to the gate of that city,

        and you shall stone them to death with stones;

        the lady, because she didn't cry, being in the city;

        and the man, because he has humbled his neighbor's wife:

        so you shall put away the evil from the midst of you.

022:025 But if the man find the lady who is pledged to be married

        in the field, and the man force her, and lie with her;

        then the man only who lay with her shall die:

022:026 but to the lady you shall do nothing; there is in the lady no sin

        worthy of death:  for as when a man rises against his neighbor,

        and kills him, even so is this matter;

022:027 for he found her in the field, the pledged to be married

        lady cried, and there was none to save her.

022:028 If a man find a lady who is a virgin, who is not pledged

        to be married, and lay hold on her, and lie with her,

        and they be found;

022:029 then the man who lay with her shall give to the lady's father

        fifty [shekels] of silver, and she shall be his wife,

        because he has humbled her; he may not put her away all his days.

022:030 A man shall not take his father's wife, and shall not uncover

        his father's skirt.

023:001 He who is wounded in the stones, or has his privy member cut off,

        shall not enter into the assembly of Yahweh.

023:002 A bastard shall not enter into the assembly of Yahweh;

        even to the tenth generation shall none of his enter into

        the assembly of Yahweh.

023:003 An Ammonite or a Moabite shall not enter into the assembly

        of Yahweh; even to the tenth generation shall none belonging

        to them enter into the assembly of Yahweh forever:

023:004 because they didn't meet you with bread and with water in the way,

        when you came forth out of Egypt, and because they hired

        against you Balaam the son of Beor from Pethor of Mesopotamia,

        to curse you.

023:005 Nevertheless Yahweh your God wouldn't listen to Balaam;

        but Yahweh your God turned the curse into a blessing to you,

        because Yahweh your God loved you.

023:006 You shall not seek their peace nor their prosperity all

        your days forever.

023:007 You shall not abhor an Edomite; for he is your brother:

        you shall not abhor an Egyptian, because you lived as a foreigner

        in his land.

023:008 The children of the third generation who are born to them

        shall enter into the assembly of Yahweh.

023:009 When you go forth in camp against your enemies, then you shall

        keep you from every evil thing.

023:010 If there be among you any man, who is not clean by reason

        of that which happens him by night, then shall he go abroad

        out of the camp, he shall not come within the camp:

023:011 but it shall be, when evening comes on, he shall bathe

        himself in water; and when the sun is down, he shall come

        within the camp.

023:012 You shall have a place also outside of the camp, where you

        shall go forth abroad:

023:013 and you shall have a paddle among your weapons; and it shall be,

        when you sit down abroad, you shall dig therewith, and shall

        turn back and cover that which comes from you:

023:014 for Yahweh your God walks in the midst of your camp,

        to deliver you, and to give up your enemies before you;

        therefore shall your camp be holy, that he may not see

        an unclean thing in you, and turn away from you.

023:015 You shall not deliver to his master a servant who is escaped

        from his master to you:

023:016 he shall dwell with you, in the midst of you, in the place which

        he shall choose within one of your gates, where it pleases him best:

        you shall not oppress him.

023:017 There shall be no prostitute of the daughters of Israel,

        neither shall there be a sodomite of the sons of Israel.

023:018 You shall not bring the hire of a prostitute, or the wages

        of a dog, into the house of Yahweh your God for any vow:

        for even both these are an abomination to Yahweh your God.

023:019 You shall not lend on interest to your brother; interest of money,

        interest of food, interest of anything that is lent on interest:

023:020 to a foreigner you may lend on interest; but to your brother

        you shall not lend on interest, that Yahweh your God may bless

        you in all that you put your hand to, in the land where you

        go in to possess it.

023:021 When you shall vow a vow to Yahweh your God, you shall not be slack

        to pay it:  for Yahweh your God will surely require it of you;

        and it would be sin in you.

023:022 But if you shall forbear to vow, it shall be no sin in you.

023:023 That which is gone out of your lips you shall observe and do;

        according as you have vowed to Yahweh your God, a freewill offering,

        which you have promised with your mouth.

023:024 When you come into your neighbor's vineyard, then you may eat

        of grapes your fill at your own pleasure; but you shall not

        put any in your vessel.

023:025 When you come into your neighbor's standing grain, then you

        may pluck the ears with your hand; but you shall not move

        a sickle to your neighbor's standing grain.

024:001 When a man takes a wife, and marries her, then it shall be,

        if she find no favor in his eyes, because he has found some

        unseemly thing in her, that he shall write her a bill of divorce,

        and give it in her hand, and send her out of his house.

024:002 When she is departed out of his house, she may go and be

        another man's [wife].

024:003 If the latter husband hate her, and write her a bill of divorce,

        and give it in her hand, and send her out of his house;

        or if the latter husband die, who took her to be his wife;

024:004 her former husband, who sent her away, may not take her again

        to be his wife, after that she is defiled; for that is abomination

        before Yahweh:  and you shall not cause the land to sin,

        which Yahweh your God gives you for an inheritance.

024:005 When a man takes a new wife, he shall not go out in the army,

        neither shall he be charged with any business:

        he shall be free at home one year, and shall cheer his wife

        whom he has taken.

024:006 No man shall take the mill or the upper millstone to pledge;

        for he takes [a man's] life to pledge.

024:007 If a man be found stealing any of his brothers of the children

        of Israel, and he deal with him as a slave, or sell him;

        then that thief shall die:  so shall you put away the evil

        from the midst of you.

024:008 Take heed in the plague of leprosy, that you observe diligently,

        and do according to all that the priests the Levites shall

        teach you:  as I commanded them, so you shall observe to do.

024:009 Remember what Yahweh your God did to Miriam, by the way as you

        came forth out of Egypt.

024:010 When you do lend your neighbor any manner of loan, you shall

        not go into his house to get his pledge.

024:011 You shall stand outside, and the man to whom you do lend shall

        bring forth the pledge outside to you.

024:012 If he be a poor man, you shall not sleep with his pledge;

024:013 you shall surely restore to him the pledge when the sun

        goes down, that he may sleep in his garment, and bless you:

        and it shall be righteousness to you before Yahweh your God.

024:014 You shall not oppress a hired servant who is poor and needy,

        whether he be of your brothers, or of your foreigners who are

        in your land within your gates:

024:015 in his day you shall give him his hire, neither shall the sun

        go down on it; for he is poor, and sets his heart on it:

        lest he cry against you to Yahweh, and it be sin to you.

024:016 The fathers shall not be put to death for the children,

        neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers:

        every man shall be put to death for his own sin.

024:017 You shall not wrest the justice [due] to the foreigner,

        [or] to the fatherless, nor take the widow's clothing to pledge;

024:018 but you shall remember that you were a bondservant in Egypt,

        and Yahweh your God redeemed you there:  therefore I command

        you to do this thing.

024:019 When you reap your harvest in your field, and have forgot

        a sheaf in the field, you shall not go again to get it:

        it shall be for the foreigner, for the fatherless, and for

        the widow; that Yahweh your God may bless you in all the work

        of your hands.

024:020 When you beat your olive tree, you shall not go over the

        boughs again:  it shall be for the foreigner, for the fatherless,

        and for the widow.

024:021 When you gather [the grapes of] your vineyard, you shall

        not glean it after you:  it shall be for the foreigner,

        for the fatherless, and for the widow.

024:022 You shall remember that you were a bondservant in the land of Egypt:

        therefore I command you to do this thing.

025:001 If there be a controversy between men, and they come to judgment,

        and [the judges] judge them; then they shall justify the righteous,

        and condemn the wicked;

025:002 and it shall be, if the wicked man be worthy to be beaten,

        that the judge shall cause him to lie down, and to be beaten

        before his face, according to his wickedness, by number.

025:003 Forty stripes he may give him, he shall not exceed; lest, if he

        should exceed, and beat him above these with many stripes,

        then your brother should seem vile to you.

025:004 You shall not muzzle the ox when he treads out [the grain].

025:005 If brothers dwell together, and one of them die, and have no son,

        the wife of the dead shall not be married outside to a stranger:

        her husband's brother shall go in to her, and take her to him

        as wife, and perform the duty of a husband's brother to her.

025:006 It shall be, that the firstborn whom she bears shall succeed

        in the name of his brother who is dead, that his name not be

        blotted out of Israel.

025:007 If the man doesn't want to take his brother's wife, then his

        brother's wife shall go up to the gate to the elders, and say,

        My husband's brother refuses to raise up to his brother

        a name in Israel; he will not perform the duty of a husband's

        brother to me.

025:008 Then the elders of his city shall call him, and speak to him:

        and if he stand, and say, I don't want to take her;

025:009 then his brother's wife shall come to him in the presence

        of the elders, and loose his shoe from off his foot, and spit

        in his face; and she shall answer and say, So shall it be done

        to the man who does not build up his brother's house.

025:010 His name shall be called in Israel, The house of him who has

        his shoe untied.

025:011 When men strive together one with another, and the wife

        of the one draws near to deliver her husband out of the hand

        of him who strikes him, and puts forth her hand, and takes

        him by the secrets;

025:012 then you shall cut off her hand, your eye shall have no pity.

025:013 You shall not have in your bag diverse weights, a great

        and a small.

025:014 You shall not have in your house diverse measures, a great

        and a small.

025:015 A perfect and just weight shall you have; a perfect and just

        measure shall you have:  that your days may be long in the land

        which Yahweh your God gives you.

025:016 For all who do such things, [even] all who do unrighteously,

        are an abomination to Yahweh your God.

025:017 Remember what Amalek did to you by the way as you came forth

        out of Egypt;

025:018 how he met you by the way, and struck the hindmost of you,

        all who were feeble behind you, when you were faint and weary;

        and he didn't fear God.

025:019 Therefore it shall be, when Yahweh your God has given you

        rest from all your enemies round about, in the land which

        Yahweh your God gives you for an inheritance to possess it,

        that you shall blot out the memory of Amalek from under the sky;

        you shall not forget.

026:001 It shall be, when you are come in to the land which Yahweh

        your God gives you for an inheritance, and possess it,

        and dwell therein,

026:002 that you shall take of the first of all the fruit of the ground,

        which you shall bring in from your land that Yahweh your God

        gives you; and you shall put it in a basket, and shall go

        to the place which Yahweh your God shall choose, to cause

        his name to dwell there.

026:003 You shall come to the priest who shall be in those days,

        and tell him, I profess this day to Yahweh your God,

        that I am come to the land which Yahweh swore to our fathers

        to give us.

026:004 The priest shall take the basket out of your hand, and set it

        down before the altar of Yahweh your God.

026:005 You shall answer and say before Yahweh your God, A Syrian

        ready to perish was my father; and he went down into Egypt,

        and sojourned there, few in number; and he became there

        a nation, great, mighty, and populous.

026:006 The Egyptians dealt ill with us, and afflicted us, and laid

        on us hard bondage:

026:007 and we cried to Yahweh, the God of our fathers, and Yahweh

        heard our voice, and saw our affliction, and our toil,

        and our oppression;

026:008 and Yahweh brought us forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand,

        and with an outstretched arm, and with great terror,

        and with signs, and with wonders;

026:009 and he has brought us into this place, and has given us this land,

        a land flowing with milk and honey.

026:010 Now, behold, I have brought the first of the fruit of the ground,

        which you, Yahweh, have given me.  You shall set it down

        before Yahweh your God, and worship before Yahweh your God.

026:011 You shall rejoice in all the good which Yahweh your God

        has given to you, and to your house, you, and the Levite,

        and the foreigner who is in the midst of you.

026:012 When you have made an end of tithing all the tithe of your

        increase in the third year, which is the year of tithing,

        then you shall give it to the Levite, to the foreigner,

        to the fatherless, and to the widow, that they may eat within

        your gates, and be filled.

026:013 You shall say before Yahweh your God, I have put away the holy

        things out of my house, and also have given them to the Levite,

        and to the foreigner, to the fatherless, and to the widow,

        according to all your commandment which you have commanded me:

        I have not transgressed any of your commandments, neither have

        I forgotten them:

026:014 I have not eaten of it in my mourning, neither have I put

        away of it, being unclean, nor given of it for the dead:

        I have listened to the voice of Yahweh my God; I have done

        according to all that you have commanded me.

026:015 Look down from your holy habitation, from heaven, and bless

        your people Israel, and the ground which you have given us,

        as you swore to our fathers, a land flowing with milk and honey.

026:016 This day Yahweh your God commands you to do these statutes

        and ordinances:  you shall therefore keep and do them with all

        your heart, and with all your soul.

026:017 You have declared Yahweh this day to be your God, and that you would

        walk in his ways, and keep his statutes, and his commandments,

        and his ordinances, and listen to his voice:

026:018 and Yahweh has declared you this day to be a people for his

        own possession, as he has promised you, and that you should

        keep all his commandments;

026:019 and to make you high above all nations that he has made,

        in praise, and in name, and in honor; and that you may be

        a holy people to Yahweh your God, as he has spoken.

027:001 Moses and the elders of Israel commanded the people, saying,

        Keep all the commandment which I command you this day.

027:002 It shall be on the day when you shall pass over the Jordan

        to the land which Yahweh your God gives you, that you shall

        set yourself up great stones, and plaster them with plaster:

027:003 and you shall write on them all the words of this law, when you

        are passed over; that you may go in to the land which Yahweh

        your God gives you, a land flowing with milk and honey,

        as Yahweh, the God of your fathers, has promised you.

027:004 It shall be, when you are passed over the Jordan, that you

        shall set up these stones, which I command you this day,

        in Mount Ebal, and you shall plaster them with plaster.

027:005 There shall you build an altar to Yahweh your God, an altar

        of stones:  you shall lift up no iron [tool] on them.

027:006 You shall build the altar of Yahweh your God of uncut stones;

        and you shall offer burnt offerings thereon to Yahweh your God:

027:007 and you shall sacrifice peace offerings, and shall eat there;

        and you shall rejoice before Yahweh your God.

027:008 You shall write on the stones all the words of this

        law very plainly.

027:009 Moses and the priests the Levites spoke to all Israel, saying,

        Keep silence, and listen, Israel:  this day you are become

        the people of Yahweh your God.

027:010 You shall therefore obey the voice of Yahweh your God,

        and do his commandments and his statutes, which I command

        you this day.

027:011 Moses charged the people the same day, saying,

027:012 These shall stand on Mount Gerizim to bless the people,

        when you are passed over the Jordan:  Simeon, and Levi,

        and Judah, and Issachar, and Joseph, and Benjamin.

027:013 These shall stand on Mount Ebal for the curse:  Reuben, Gad,

        and Asher, and Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali.

027:014 The Levites shall answer, and tell all the men of Israel

        with a loud voice,

027:015 Cursed be the man who makes an engraved or molten image,

        an abomination to Yahweh, the work of the hands of the craftsman,

        and sets it up in secret.  All the people shall answer

        and say, Amen.

027:016 Cursed be he who sets light by his father or his mother.

        All the people shall say, Amen.

027:017 Cursed be he who removes his neighbor's landmark.

        All the people shall say, Amen.

027:018 Cursed be he who makes the blind to wander out of the way.

        All the people shall say, Amen.

027:019 Cursed be he who wrests the justice [due] to the foreigner,

        fatherless, and widow.  All the people shall say, Amen.

027:020 Cursed be he who lies with his father's wife, because he has

        uncovered his father's skirt.  All the people shall say, Amen.

027:021 Cursed be he who lies with any manner of animal.

        All the people shall say, Amen.

027:022 Cursed be he who lies with his sister, the daughter of his father,

        or the daughter of his mother.  All the people shall say, Amen.

027:023 Cursed be he who lies with his mother-in-law. All the people

        shall say, Amen.

027:024 Cursed be he who strikes his neighbor in secret.

        All the people shall say, Amen.

027:025 Cursed be he who takes a bribe to kill an innocent person.

        All the people shall say, Amen.

027:026 Cursed be he who doesn't confirm the words of this law to do them.

        All the people shall say, Amen.

028:001 It shall happen, if you shall listen diligently to the voice

        of Yahweh your God, to observe to do all his commandments

        which I command you this day, that Yahweh your God will set

        you on high above all the nations of the earth:

028:002 and all these blessings shall come on you, and overtake you,

        if you shall listen to the voice of Yahweh your God.

028:003 Blessed shall you be in the city, and blessed shall you be

        in the field.

028:004 Blessed shall be the fruit of your body, and the fruit of your ground,

        and the fruit of your animals, the increase of your livestock,

        and the young of your flock.

028:005 Blessed shall be your basket and your kneading trough.

028:006 Blessed shall you be when you come in, and blessed shall you

        be when you go out.

028:007 Yahweh will cause your enemies who rise up against you to be

        struck before you:  they shall come out against you one way,

        and shall flee before you seven ways.

028:008 Yahweh will command the blessing on you in your barns,

        and in all that you put your hand to; and he will bless you

        in the land which Yahweh your God gives you.

028:009 Yahweh will establish you for a holy people to himself,

        as he has sworn to you; if you shall keep the commandments

        of Yahweh your God, and walk in his ways.

028:010 All the peoples of the earth shall see that you are called

        by the name of Yahweh; and they shall be afraid of you.

028:011 Yahweh will make you plenteous for good, in the fruit of your body,

        and in the fruit of your livestock, and in the fruit of your ground,

        in the land which Yahweh swore to your fathers to give you.

028:012 Yahweh will open to you his good treasure in the sky,

        to give the rain of your land in its season, and to bless all

        the work of your hand:  and you shall lend to many nations,

        and you shall not borrow.

028:013 Yahweh will make you the head, and not the tail;

        and you shall be above only, and you shall not be beneath;

        if you shall listen to the commandments of Yahweh your God,

        which I command you this day, to observe and to do [them],

028:014 and shall not turn aside from any of the words which I

        command you this day, to the right hand, or to the left,

        to go after other gods to serve them.

028:015 But it shall come to pass, if you will not listen to the voice

        of Yahweh your God, to observe to do all his commandments

        and his statutes which I command you this day, that all

        these curses shall come on you, and overtake you.

028:016 Cursed shall you be in the city, and cursed shall you be

        in the field.

028:017 Cursed shall be your basket and your kneading trough.

028:018 Cursed shall be the fruit of your body, and the fruit of your ground,

        the increase of your livestock, and the young of your flock.

028:019 Cursed shall you be when you come in, and cursed shall you

        be when you go out.

028:020 Yahweh will send on you cursing, confusion, and rebuke,

        in all that you put your hand to do, until you are destroyed,

        and until you perish quickly; because of the evil of your doings,

        by which you have forsaken me.

028:021 Yahweh will make the pestilence cleave to you, until he has

        consumed you from off the land, where you go in to possess it.

028:022 Yahweh will strike you with consumption, and with fever,

        and with inflammation, and with fiery heat, and with the sword,

        and with blight, and with mildew; and they shall pursue you

        until you perish.

028:023 Your sky that is over your head shall be brass, and the earth

        that is under you shall be iron.

028:024 Yahweh will make the rain of your land powder and dust:

        from the sky shall it come down on you, until you are destroyed.

028:025 Yahweh will cause you to be struck before your enemies;

        you shall go out one way against them, and shall flee seven

        ways before them:  and you shall be tossed back and forth

        among all the kingdoms of the earth.

028:026 Your dead body shall be food to all birds of the sky,

        and to the animals of the earth; and there shall be none

        to frighten them away.

028:027 Yahweh will strike you with the boil of Egypt, and with the tumors,

        and with the scurvy, and with the itch, of which you can

        not be healed.

028:028 Yahweh will strike you with madness, and with blindness,

        and with astonishment of heart;

028:029 and you shall grope at noonday, as the blind gropes

        in darkness, and you shall not prosper in your ways:

        and you shall be only oppressed and robbed always, and there

        shall be none to save you.

028:030 You shall betroth a wife, and another man shall lie with her:

        you shall build a house, and you shall not dwell therein:

        you shall plant a vineyard, and shall not use the fruit of it.

028:031 Your ox shall be slain before your eyes, and you shall

        not eat of it:  your donkey shall be violently taken away

        from before your face, and shall not be restored to you:

        your sheep shall be given to your enemies, and you shall

        have none to save you.

028:032 Your sons and your daughters shall be given to another people;

        and your eyes shall look, and fail with longing for them all

        the day:  and there shall be nothing in the power of your hand.

028:033 The fruit of your ground, and all your labors, shall a nation

        which you don't know eat up; and you shall be only oppressed

        and crushed always;

028:034 so that you shall be mad for the sight of your eyes which

        you shall see.

028:035 Yahweh will strike you in the knees, and in the legs,

        with a sore boil, of which you can not be healed, from the sole

        of your foot to the crown of your head.

028:036 Yahweh will bring you, and your king whom you shall set over you,

        to a nation that you have not known, you nor your fathers;

        and there shall you serve other gods, wood and stone.

028:037 You shall become an astonishment, a proverb, and a byword,

        among all the peoples where Yahweh shall lead you away.

028:038 You shall carry much seed out into the field, and shall gather

        little in; for the locust shall consume it.

028:039 You shall plant vineyards and dress them, but you shall

        neither drink of the wine, nor gather [the grapes];

        for the worm shall eat them.

028:040 You shall have olive trees throughout all your borders,

        but you shall not anoint yourself with the oil; for your olive

        shall cast [its fruit].

028:041 You shall father sons and daughters, but they shall not be yours;

        for they shall go into captivity.

028:042 All your trees and the fruit of your ground shall the locust possess.

028:043 The foreigner who is in the midst of you shall mount up above

        you higher and higher; and you shall come down lower and lower.

028:044 He shall lend to you, and you shall not lend to him:

        he shall be the head, and you shall be the tail.

028:045 All these curses shall come on you, and shall pursue you,

        and overtake you, until you are destroyed; because you didn't

        listen to the voice of Yahweh your God, to keep his commandments

        and his statutes which he commanded you:

028:046 and they shall be on you for a sign and for a wonder,

        and on your seed forever.

028:047 Because you didn't serve Yahweh your God with joyfulness,

        and with gladness of heart, by reason of the abundance

        of all things;

028:048 therefore shall you serve your enemies whom Yahweh shall send

        against you, in hunger, and in thirst, and in nakedness,

        and in want of all things:  and he shall put a yoke of iron

        on your neck, until he have destroyed you.

028:049 Yahweh will bring a nation against you from far, from the end

        of the earth, as the eagle flies; a nation whose language

        you shall not understand;

028:050 a nation of fierce facial expressions, that shall not regard

        the person of the old, nor show favor to the young,

028:051 and shall eat the fruit of your livestock, and the fruit of

        your ground, until you are destroyed; that also shall not leave

        you grain, new wine, or oil, the increase of your livestock,

        or the young of your flock, until they have caused you to perish.

028:052 They shall besiege you in all your gates, until your high

        and fortified walls come down, in which you trusted,

        throughout all your land; and they shall besiege you in all

        your gates throughout all your land, which Yahweh your God

        has given you.

028:053 You shall eat the fruit of your own body, the flesh of your sons

        and of your daughters, whom Yahweh your God has given you,

        in the siege and in the distress with which your enemies

        shall distress you.

028:054 The man who is tender among you, and very delicate, his eye shall

        be evil toward his brother, and toward the wife of his bosom,

        and toward the remnant of his children whom he has remaining;

028:055 so that he will not give to any of them of the flesh of his

        children whom he shall eat, because he has nothing left him,

        in the siege and in the distress with which your enemy shall

        distress you in all your gates.

028:056 The tender and delicate woman among you, who would not adventure

        to set the sole of her foot on the ground for delicateness

        and tenderness, her eye shall be evil toward the husband

        of her bosom, and toward her son, and toward her daughter,

028:057 and toward her young one who comes out from between her feet,

        and toward her children whom she shall bear; for she shall

        eat them for want of all things secretly, in the siege

        and in the distress with which your enemy shall distress you

        in your gates.

028:058 If you will not observe to do all the words of this law that

        are written in this book, that you may fear this glorious

        and fearful name, YAHWEH YOUR GOD;

028:059 then Yahweh will make your plagues wonderful, and the plagues

        of your seed, even great plagues, and of long continuance,

        and sore sicknesses, and of long continuance.

028:060 He will bring on you again all the diseases of Egypt,

        which you were afraid of; and they shall cleave to you.

028:061 Also every sickness, and every plague, which is not written

        in the book of this law, them will Yahweh bring on you,

        until you are destroyed.

028:062 You shall be left few in number, whereas you were as the stars

        of the sky for multitude; because you didn't listen to the voice

        of Yahweh your God.

028:063 It shall happen that as Yahweh rejoiced over you to do you good,

        and to multiply you, so Yahweh will rejoice over you to cause

        you to perish, and to destroy you; and you shall be plucked

        from off the land where you go in to possess it.

028:064 Yahweh will scatter you among all peoples, from the one

        end of the earth even to the other end of the earth;

        and there you shall serve other gods, which you have not known,

        you nor your fathers, even wood and stone.

028:065 Among these nations shall you find no ease, and there

        shall be no rest for the sole of your foot:  but Yahweh

        will give you there a trembling heart, and failing of eyes,

        and pining of soul;

028:066 and your life shall hang in doubt before you; and you shall

        fear night and day, and shall have no assurance of your life.

028:067 In the morning you shall say, Would it were even! and at even

        you shall say, Would it were morning! for the fear of your

        heart which you shall fear, and for the sight of your eyes

        which you shall see.

028:068 Yahweh will bring you into Egypt again with ships, by the way

        of which I said to you, You shall see it no more again:

        and there you shall sell yourselves to your enemies for

        bondservants and for bondmaids, and no man shall buy you.

029:001 These are the words of the covenant which Yahweh commanded

        Moses to make with the children of Israel in the land of Moab,

        besides the covenant which he made with them in Horeb.

029:002 Moses called to all Israel, and said to them, You have seen

        all that Yahweh did before your eyes in the land of Egypt

        to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land;

029:003 the great trials which your eyes saw, the signs,

        and those great wonders:

029:004 but Yahweh has not given you a heart to know, and eyes to see,

        and ears to hear, to this day.

029:005 I have led you forty years in the wilderness:  your clothes

        have not grown old on you, and your shoe has not grown old

        on your foot.

029:006 You have not eaten bread, neither have you drunk wine or strong drink;

        that you may know that I am Yahweh your God.

029:007 When you came to this place, Sihon the king of Heshbon,

        and Og the king of Bashan, came out against us to battle,

        and we struck them:

029:008 and we took their land, and gave it for an inheritance

        to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half-tribe

        of the Manassites.

029:009 Keep therefore the words of this covenant, and do them,

        that you may prosper in all that you do.

029:010 You stand this day all of you before Yahweh your God;

        your heads, your tribes, your elders, and your officers,

        even all the men of Israel,

029:011 your little ones, your wives, and your foreigner who is

        in the midst of your camps, from the one who cuts your wood

        to the one who draws your water;

029:012 that you may enter into the covenant of Yahweh your God,

        and into his oath, which Yahweh your God makes with you this day;

029:013 that he may establish you this day to himself for a people,

        and that he may be to you a God, as he spoke to you,

        and as he swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac,

        and to Jacob.

029:014 Neither with you only do I make this covenant and this oath,

029:015 but with him who stands here with us this day before Yahweh

        our God, and also with him who is not here with us this day

029:016 (for you know how we lived in the land of Egypt, and how we came

        through the midst of the nations through which you passed;

029:017 and you have seen their abominations, and their idols,

        wood and stone, silver and gold, which were among them);

029:018 lest there should be among you man, or woman, or family,

        or tribe, whose heart turns away this day from Yahweh our God,

        to go to serve the gods of those nations; lest there should

        be among you a root that bears gall and wormwood;

029:019 and it happen, when he hears the words of this curse,

        that he bless himself in his heart, saying, I shall have peace,

        though I walk in the stubbornness of my heart, to destroy

        the moist with the dry.

029:020 Yahweh will not pardon him, but then the anger of Yahweh

        and his jealousy will smoke against that man, and all

        the curse that is written in this book shall lie on him,

        and Yahweh will blot out his name from under the sky.

029:021 Yahweh will set him apart to evil out of all the tribes of Israel,

        according to all the curses of the covenant that is written

        in this book of the law.

029:022 The generation to come, your children who shall rise up after you,

        and the foreigner who shall come from a far land, shall say,

        when they see the plagues of that land, and the sicknesses

        with which Yahweh has made it sick;

029:023 [and that] the whole land of it is sulfur, and salt, [and] a burning,

        [that] it is not sown, nor bears, nor any grass grows therein,

        like the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboiim,

        which Yahweh overthrew in his anger, and in his wrath:

029:024 even all the nations shall say, Why has Yahweh done thus

        to this land? what means the heat of this great anger?

029:025 Then men shall say, Because they forsook the covenant of Yahweh,

        the God of their fathers, which he made with them when he brought

        them forth out of the land of Egypt,

029:026 and went and served other gods, and worshiped them, gods that

        they didn't know, and that he had not given to them:

029:027 therefore the anger of Yahweh was kindled against this land,

        to bring on it all the curse that is written in this book;

029:028 and Yahweh rooted them out of their land in anger, and in wrath,

        and in great indignation, and cast them into another land,

        as at this day.

029:029 The secret things belong to Yahweh our God; but the things

        that are revealed belong to us and to our children forever,

        that we may do all the words of this law.

030:001 It shall happen, when all these things are come on you,

        the blessing and the curse, which I have set before you,

        and you shall call them to mind among all the nations,

        where Yahweh your God has driven you,

030:002 and shall return to Yahweh your God, and shall obey his voice

        according to all that I command you this day, you and your children,

        with all your heart, and with all your soul;

030:003 that then Yahweh your God will turn your captivity, and have

        compassion on you, and will return and gather you from all

        the peoples, where Yahweh your God has scattered you.

030:004 If [any of] your outcasts are in the uttermost parts of

        the heavens, from there will Yahweh your God gather you,

        and from there he will bring you back:

030:005 and Yahweh your God will bring you into the land which your

        fathers possessed, and you shall possess it; and he will do

        you good, and multiply you above your fathers.

030:006 Yahweh your God will circumcise your heart, and the heart

        of your seed, to love Yahweh your God with all your heart,

        and with all your soul, that you may live.

030:007 Yahweh your God will put all these curses on your enemies,

        and on those who hate you, who persecuted you.

030:008 You shall return and obey the voice of Yahweh, and do all his

        commandments which I command you this day.

030:009 Yahweh your God will make you plenteous in all the work

        of your hand, in the fruit of your body, and in the fruit

        of your livestock, and in the fruit of your ground, for good:

        for Yahweh will again rejoice over you for good, as he rejoiced

        over your fathers;

030:010 if you shall obey the voice of Yahweh your God, to keep his

        commandments and his statutes which are written in this book

        of the law; if you turn to Yahweh your God with all your heart,

        and with all your soul.

030:011 For this commandment which I command you this day, it is not

        too hard for you, neither is it far off.

030:012 It is not in heaven, that you should say, Who shall go up

        for us to heaven, and bring it to us, and make us to hear it,

        that we may do it?

030:013 Neither is it beyond the sea, that you should say, Who shall go

        over the sea for us, and bring it to us, and make us to hear it,

        that we may do it?

030:014 But the word is very near to you, in your mouth, and in your heart,

        that you may do it.

030:015 Behold, I have set before you this day life and good,

        and death and evil;

030:016 in that I command you this day to love Yahweh your God,

        to walk in his ways, and to keep his commandments and his

        statutes and his ordinances, that you may live and multiply,

        and that Yahweh your God may bless you in the land where you

        go in to possess it.

030:017 But if your heart turn away, and you will not hear, but shall

        be drawn away, and worship other gods, and serve them;

030:018 I denounce to you this day, that you shall surely perish;

        you shall not prolong your days in the land, where you pass

        over the Jordan to go in to possess it.

030:019 I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that I

        have set before you life and death, the blessing and the curse:

        therefore choose life, that you may live, you and your seed;

030:020 to love Yahweh your God, to obey his voice, and to cleave to him;

        for he is your life, and the length of your days; that you

        may dwell in the land which Yahweh swore to your fathers,

        to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give them.

031:001 Moses went and spoke these words to all Israel.

031:002 He said to them, I am one hundred twenty years old this day;

        I can no more go out and come in:  and Yahweh has said to me,

        You shall not go over this Jordan.

031:003 Yahweh your God, he will go over before you; he will destroy

        these nations from before you, and you shall dispossess them:

        [and] Joshua, he shall go over before you, as Yahweh has spoken.

031:004 Yahweh will do to them as he did to Sihon and to Og, the kings

        of the Amorites, and to their land; whom he destroyed.

031:005 Yahweh will deliver them up before you, and you shall do to them

        according to all the commandment which I have commanded you.

031:006 Be strong and of good courage, don't be afraid, nor be scared

        of them:  for Yahweh your God, he it is who does go with you;

        he will not fail you, nor forsake you.

031:007 Moses called to Joshua, and said to him in the sight of

        all Israel, Be strong and of good courage:  for you shall

        go with this people into the land which Yahweh has sworn

        to their fathers to give them; and you shall cause them

        to inherit it.

031:008 Yahweh, he it is who does go before you; he will be with you,

        he will not fail you, neither forsake you:  don't be afraid,

        neither be dismayed.

031:009 Moses wrote this law, and delivered it to the priests the sons

        of Levi, who bore the ark of the covenant of Yahweh,

        and to all the elders of Israel.

031:010 Moses commanded them, saying, At the end of [every] seven years,

        in the set time of the year of release, in the feast of tents,

031:011 when all Israel is come to appear before Yahweh your God

        in the place which he shall choose, you shall read this law

        before all Israel in their hearing.

031:012 Assemble the people, the men and the women and the little ones,

        and your foreigner who is within your gates, that they

        may hear, and that they may learn, and fear Yahweh your God,

        and observe to do all the words of this law;

031:013 and that their children, who have not known, may hear,

        and learn to fear Yahweh your God, as long as you live

        in the land where you go over the Jordan to possess it.

031:014 Yahweh said to Moses, Behold, your days approach that you must die:

        call Joshua, and present yourselves in the tent of meeting,

        that I may give him a charge.  Moses and Joshua went,

        and presented themselves in the tent of meeting.

031:015 Yahweh appeared in the Tent in a pillar of cloud:

        and the pillar of cloud stood over the door of the Tent.

031:016 Yahweh said to Moses, Behold, you shall sleep with your fathers;

        and this people will rise up, and play the prostitute after

        the strange gods of the land, where they go to be among them,

        and will forsake me, and break my covenant which I have

        made with them.

031:017 Then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day,

        and I will forsake them, and I will hide my face from them,

        and they shall be devoured, and many evils and troubles

        shall come on them; so that they will say in that day,

        Haven't these evils come on us because our God is not among us?

031:018 I will surely hide my face in that day for all the evil which they

        shall have worked, in that they are turned to other gods.

031:019 Now therefore write you this song for you, and teach you it

        the children of Israel:  put it in their mouths, that this

        song may be a witness for me against the children of Israel.

031:020 For when I shall have brought them into the land which I

        swore to their fathers, flowing with milk and honey,

        and they shall have eaten and filled themselves, and grown fat;

        then will they turn to other gods, and serve them, and despise me,

        and break my covenant.

031:021 It shall happen, when many evils and troubles are come on them,

        that this song shall testify before them as a witness;

        for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed:

        for I know their imagination which they frame this day,

        before I have brought them into the land which I swore.

031:022 So Moses wrote this song the same day, and taught it

        the children of Israel.

031:023 He gave Joshua the son of Nun a charge, and said,

        Be strong and of good courage; for you shall bring

        the children of Israel into the land which I swore to them:

        and I will be with you.

031:024 It happened, when Moses had made an end of writing the words

        of this law in a book, until they were finished,

031:025 that Moses commanded the Levites, who bore the ark of the covenant

        of Yahweh, saying,

031:026 Take this book of the law, and put it by the side of the ark

        of the covenant of Yahweh your God, that it may be there

        for a witness against you.

031:027 For I know your rebellion, and your stiff neck:  behold, while I

        am yet alive with you this day, you have been rebellious

        against Yahweh; and how much more after my death?

031:028 Assemble to me all the elders of your tribes, and your officers,

        that I may speak these words in their ears, and call heaven

        and earth to witness against them.

031:029 For I know that after my death you will utterly corrupt yourselves,

        and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you;

        and evil will happen to you in the latter days; because you

        will do that which is evil in the sight of Yahweh, to provoke

        him to anger through the work of your hands.

031:030 Moses spoke in the ears of all the assembly of Israel the words

        of this song, until they were finished.

032:001 Give ear, you heavens, and I will speak.  Let the earth hear

        the words of my mouth.

032:002 My doctrine shall drop as the rain.  My speech shall

        condense as the dew, as the small rain on the tender grass,

        as the showers on the herb.

032:003 For I will proclaim the name of Yahweh.  Ascribe greatness

        to our God!

032:004 The Rock, his work is perfect, for all his ways are justice:

        a God of faithfulness and without iniquity, just and right is he.

032:005 They have dealt corruptly with him, [they are] not

        his children, [it is] their blemish.  [They are] a perverse

        and crooked generation.

032:006 Do you thus requite Yahweh, foolish people and unwise?

        Isn't he your father who has bought you?  He has made you,

        and established you.

032:007 Remember the days of old.  Consider the years of many generations.

        Ask your father, and he will show you; your elders, and they

        will tell you.

032:008 When the Most High gave to the nations their inheritance,

        when he separated the children of men, he set the bounds of

        the peoples according to the number of the children of Israel.

032:009 For Yahweh's portion is his people.  Jacob is the lot

        of his inheritance.

032:010 He found him in a desert land, in the waste howling wilderness.

        He surrounded him.  He cared for him.  He kept him as the apple

        of his eye.

032:011 As an eagle that stirs up her nest, that flutters over her young,

        he spread abroad his wings, he took them, he bore them

        on his feathers.

032:012 Yahweh alone led him.  There was no foreign god with him.

032:013 He made him ride on the high places of the earth.

        He ate the increase of the field.  He caused him to suck

        honey out of the rock, oil out of the flinty rock;

032:014 Butter of the herd, and milk of the flock, with fat of lambs, rams of

        the breed of Bashan, and goats, with the finest of the wheat.

        Of the blood of the grape you drank wine.

032:015 But Jeshurun grew fat, and kicked.  You have grown fat.

        You have grown thick.  You have become sleek.

        Then he forsook God who made him, and lightly esteemed the Rock

        of his salvation.

032:016 They moved him to jealousy with strange [gods]. They provoked

        him to anger with abominations.

032:017 They sacrificed to demons, [which were] no God, to gods

        that they didn't know, to new [gods] that came up of late,

        which your fathers didn't dread.

032:018 Of the Rock who became your father, you are unmindful,

        and have forgotten God who gave you birth.

032:019 Yahweh saw [it], and abhorred [them], because of the provocation

        of his sons and his daughters.

032:020 He said, I will hide my face from them.  I will see what their

        end shall be; for they are a very perverse generation,

        children in whom is no faithfulness.

032:021 They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God.

        They have provoked me to anger with their vanities.

        I will move them to jealousy with those who are not a people.

        I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation.

032:022 For a fire is kindled in my anger, Burns to the lowest

        Sheol, Devours the earth with its increase, and sets

        the foundations of the mountains on fire.

032:023 I will heap evils on them.  I will spend my arrows on them.

032:024 [They shall be] wasted with hunger, and devoured with burning

        heat and bitter destruction.  I will send the teeth of animals

        on them, With the poison of crawling things of the dust.

032:025 Outside the sword shall bereave, and in the chambers, terror; on both

        young man and virgin, The suckling with the gray-haired man.

032:026 I said, I would scatter them afar.  I would make the memory

        of them to cease from among men;

032:027 were it not that I feared the provocation of the enemy,

        lest their adversaries should judge wrongly, lest they should say,

        Our hand is exalted, Yahweh has not done all this.

032:028 For they are a nation void of counsel.  There is no

        understanding in them.

032:029 Oh that they were wise, that they understood this, that they

        would consider their latter end!

032:030 How could one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand

        to flight, unless their Rock had sold them, and Yahweh had

        delivered them up?

032:031 For their rock is not as our Rock, even our enemies

        themselves being judges.

032:032 For their vine is of the vine of Sodom, of the fields of Gomorrah.

        Their grapes are grapes of gall, Their clusters are bitter.

032:033 Their wine is the poison of serpents, The cruel venom of asps.

032:034 Isn't this laid up in store with me, sealed up among my treasures?

032:035 Vengeance is mine, and recompense, at the time when their

        foot slides; for the day of their calamity is at hand.

        The things that are to come on them shall make haste.

032:036 For Yahweh will judge his people, and have compassion

        on his servants, when he sees that [their] power is gone,

        There is none [remaining], shut up or left at large.

032:037 He will say, Where are their gods, The rock in which

        they took refuge;

032:038 Which ate the fat of their sacrifices, And drank the wine

        of their drink offering?  Let them rise up and help you!

        Let them be your protection.

032:039 See now that I, even I, am he, There is no god with me.

        I kill, and I make alive.  I wound, and I heal.

        There is no one who can deliver out of my hand.

032:040 For I lift up my hand to heaven, And say, As I live forever,

032:041 if I whet my glittering sword, My hand take hold on judgment;

        I will render vengeance to my adversaries, and will recompense

        those who hate me.

032:042 I will make my arrows drunk with blood.  My sword shall

        devour flesh with the blood of the slain and the captives,

        from the head of the leaders of the enemy.

032:043 Rejoice, you nations, [with] his people, for he will avenge

        the blood of his servants.  He will render vengeance

        to his adversaries, And will make expiation for his land,

        for his people.

032:044 Moses came and spoke all the words of this song in the ears

        of the people, he and Joshua the son of Nun.

032:045 Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all Israel;

032:046 He said to them, Set your heart to all the words which I

        testify to you this day, which you shall command your children

        to observe to do, [even] all the words of this law.

032:047 For it is no vain thing for you; because it is your life,

        and through this thing you shall prolong your days in the land,

        where you go over the Jordan to possess it.

032:048 Yahweh spoke to Moses that same day, saying,

032:049 Go up into this mountain of Abarim, to Mount Nebo,

        which is in the land of Moab, that is over against Jericho;

        and see the land of Canaan, which I give to the children

        of Israel for a possession;

032:050 and die on the mountain where you go up, and be gathered

        to your people, as Aaron your brother died on Mount Hor,

        and was gathered to his people:

032:051 because you trespassed against me in the midst of the children

        of Israel at the waters of Meribah of Kadesh, in the wilderness

        of Zin; because you didn't sanctify me in the midst of

        the children of Israel.

032:052 For you shall see the land before you; but you shall not go

        there into the land which I give the children of Israel.

033:001 This is the blessing, with which Moses the man of God blessed

        the children of Israel before his death.

033:002 He said, Yahweh came from Sinai, And rose from Seir to them.

        He shone forth from Mount Paran.  He came from the ten thousands

        of holy ones.  At his right hand was a fiery law for them.

033:003 Yes, he loves the people.  All his saints are in your hand.

        They sat down at your feet; [Everyone] shall receive

        of your words.

033:004 Moses commanded us a law, An inheritance for the assembly of Jacob.

033:005 He was king in Jeshurun, When the heads of the people were gathered,

        All the tribes of Israel together.

033:006 Let Reuben live, and not die; Nor let his men be few.

033:007 This is [the blessing] of Judah:  and he said, Hear, Yahweh,

        the voice of Judah.  Bring him in to his people.

        With his hands he contended for himself.  You shall be a help

        against his adversaries.

033:008 Of Levi he said, Your Thummim and your Urim are with your

        godly one, whom you proved at Massah, with whom you strove

        at the waters of Meribah;

033:009 who said of his father, and of his mother, I have not seen him;

        Neither did he acknowledge his brothers, Nor did he know

        his own children:  For they have observed your word,

        and keep your covenant.

033:010 They shall teach Jacob your ordinances, and Israel your law.

        They shall put incense before you, and whole burnt offering

        on your altar.

033:011 Yahweh, bless his substance.  Accept the work of his hands.

        Strike through the hips of those who rise up against him,

        of those who hate him, that they not rise again.

033:012 Of Benjamin he said, The beloved of Yahweh shall dwell

        in safety by him.  He covers him all the day long.

        He dwells between his shoulders.

033:013 Of Joseph he said, His land is blessed by Yahweh, for the

        precious things of the heavens, for the dew, for the deep

        that couches beneath,

033:014 for the precious things of the fruits of the sun, for the precious

        things of the growth of the moons,

033:015 for the chief things of the ancient mountains, for the precious

        things of the everlasting hills,

033:016 for the precious things of the earth and its fullness,

        the good will of him who lived in the bush{i. e.

        the burning bush of Exodus 3:3-4.}. Let [the blessing] come

        on the head of Joseph, On the crown of the head of him who was

        separate from his brothers.

033:017 The firstborn of his herd, majesty is his.  His horns are

        the horns of the wild ox.  With them he shall push the peoples

        all of them, [even] the ends of the earth:  They are the ten

        thousands of Ephraim.  They are the thousands of Manasseh.

033:018 Of Zebulun he said, Rejoice, Zebulun, in your going out;

        and Issachar, in your tents.

033:019 They shall call the peoples to the mountain.  There they will

        offer sacrifices of righteousness, for they shall draw out

        the abundance of the seas, the hidden treasures of the sand.

033:020 Of Gad he said, He who enlarges Gad is blessed.

        He dwells as a lioness, and tears the arm, yes, the crown

        of the head.

033:021 He provided the first part for himself, for there was the lawgiver's

        portion reserved.  He came [with] the heads of the people.

        He executed the righteousness of Yahweh, His ordinances with Israel.

033:022 Of Dan he said, Dan is a lion's cub that leaps out of Bashan.

033:023 Of Naphtali he said, Naphtali, satisfied with favor, full of

        the blessing of Yahweh, Possess the west and the south.

033:024 Of Asher he said, Asher is blessed with children.

        Let him be acceptable to his brothers.  Let him dip his

        foot in oil.

033:025 Your bars shall be iron and brass.  As your days, so shall

        your strength be.

033:026 There is none like God, Jeshurun, who rides on the heavens

        for your help, In his excellency on the skies.

033:027 The eternal God is [your] dwelling place.  Underneath are

        the everlasting arms.  He thrust out the enemy from before you,

        and said, Destroy.

033:028 Israel dwells in safety; the fountain of Jacob alone, In a land

        of grain and new wine.  Yes, his heavens drop down dew.

033:029 You are happy, Israel.  Who is like you, a people saved by Yahweh,

        the shield of your help, the sword of your excellency!

        Your enemies shall submit themselves to you.  You shall tread

        on their high places.

034:001 Moses went up from the plains of Moab to Mount Nebo,

        to the top of Pisgah, that is over against Jericho.

        Yahweh showed him all the land of Gilead, to Dan,

034:002 and all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim and Manasseh,

        and all the land of Judah, to the hinder sea,

034:003 and the South, and the Plain of the valley of Jericho the city

        of palm trees, to Zoar.

034:004 Yahweh said to him, This is the land which I swore to Abraham,

        to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, I will give it to your seed:

        I have caused you to see it with your eyes, but you shall

        not go over there.

034:005 So Moses the servant of Yahweh died there in the land of Moab,

        according to the word of Yahweh.

034:006 He buried him in the valley in the land of Moab over against

        Beth Peor:  but no man knows of his tomb to this day.

034:007 Moses was one hundred twenty years old when he died:

        his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated.

034:008 The children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab

        thirty days:  so the days of weeping in the mourning for

        Moses were ended.

034:009 Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom;

        for Moses had laid his hands on him:  and the children of Israel

        listened to him, and did as Yahweh commanded Moses.

034:010 There has not arisen a prophet since in Israel like Moses,

        whom Yahweh knew face to face,

034:011 in all the signs and the wonders, which Yahweh sent him to do

        in the land of Egypt, to Pharaoh, and to all his servants,

        and to all his land,

034:012 and in all the mighty hand, and in all the great terror,

        which Moses worked in the sight of all Israel.

Book 06 Joshua

001:001 Now it happened after the death of Moses the servant of Yahweh,

        that Yahweh spoke to Joshua the son of Nun, Moses' servant, saying,

001:002 Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over this Jordan,

        you, and all this people, to the land which I give to them,

        even to the children of Israel.

001:003 I have given you every place that the sole of your foot will

        tread on, as I told Moses.

001:004 From the wilderness, and this Lebanon, even to the great river,

        the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites,

        and to the great sea toward the going down of the sun,

        shall be your border.

001:005 No man will be able to stand before you all the days of your life.

        As I was with Moses, so I will be with you.  I will not fail

        you nor forsake you.

001:006 Be strong and of good courage; for you shall cause this

        people to inherit the land which I swore to their fathers

        to give them.

001:007 Only be strong and very courageous, to observe to do according

        to all the law, which Moses my servant commanded you.

        Don't turn from it to the right hand or to the left,

        that you may have good success wherever you go.

001:008 This book of the law shall not depart out of your mouth,

        but you shall meditate on it day and night, that you may

        observe to do according to all that is written therein:

        for then you shall make your way prosperous, and then you

        shall have good success.

001:009 Haven't I commanded you?  Be strong and of good courage.

        Don't be afraid, neither be dismayed:  for Yahweh your God

        is with you wherever you go.

001:010 Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,

001:011 "Pass through the midst of the camp, and command the people,

        saying, 'Prepare food; for within three days you are to pass

        over this Jordan, to go in to possess the land, which Yahweh

        your God gives you to possess it.'"

001:012 Joshua spoke to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to

        the half-tribe of Manasseh, saying,

001:013 "Remember the word which Moses the servant of Yahweh

        commanded you, saying, 'Yahweh your God gives you rest,

        and will give you this land.

001:014 Your wives, your little ones, and your livestock, shall live

        in the land which Moses gave you beyond the Jordan; but you

        shall pass over before your brothers armed, all the mighty

        men of valor, and shall help them

001:015 until Yahweh has given your brothers rest, as he has given you,

        and they have also possessed the land which Yahweh your God

        gives them.  Then you shall return to the land of your possession,

        and possess it, which Moses the servant of Yahweh gave you

        beyond the Jordan toward the sunrise.'"

001:016 They answered Joshua, saying, "All that you have commanded us

        we will do, and wherever you send us we will go.

001:017 Just as we listened to Moses in all things, so will we listen to you.

        Only may Yahweh your God be with you, as he was with Moses.

001:018 Whoever rebels against your commandment, and doesn't listen to your

        words in all that you command him, he shall be put to death.

        Only be strong and of good courage."

002:001 Joshua the son of Nun secretly sent two men out of Shittim

        as spies, saying, "Go, view the land, and Jericho."

        They went and came into the house of a prostitute whose name

        was Rahab, and slept there.

002:002 The king of Jericho was told, "Behold, men of the children

        of Israel came in here tonight to spy out the land."

002:003 The king of Jericho sent to Rahab, saying, "Bring out the men

        who have come to you, who have entered into your house;

        for they have come to spy out all the land."

002:004 The woman took the two men and hid them.  Then she said, "Yes,

        the men came to me, but I didn't know where they came from.

002:005 It happened about the time of the shutting of the gate, when it

        was dark, that the men went out.  Where the men went, I don't know.

        Pursue them quickly; for you will overtake them."

002:006 But she had brought them up to the roof, and hid them with

        the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order on the roof.

002:007 The men pursued them the way to the Jordan to the fords:

        and as soon as those who pursued them had gone out,

        they shut the gate.

002:008 Before they had laid down, she came up to them on the roof;

002:009 and she said to the men, "I know that Yahweh has given

        you the land, and that the fear of you has fallen on us,

        and that all the inhabitants of the land melt away before you.

002:010 For we have heard how Yahweh dried up the water of the

        Red Sea{or, Sea of Reeds} before you, when you came out of Egypt;

        and what you did to the two kings of the Amorites, who were beyond

        the Jordan, to Sihon and to Og, whom you utterly destroyed.

002:011 As soon as we had heard it, our hearts melted, neither did

        there remain any more spirit in any man, because of you:

        for Yahweh your God, he is God in heaven above,

        and on earth beneath.

002:012 Now therefore, please swear to me by Yahweh, since I have dealt

        kindly with you, that you also will deal kindly with my

        father's house, and give me a true token;

002:013 and that you will save alive my father, my mother, my brothers,

        and my sisters, and all that they have, and will deliver

        our lives from death."

002:014 The men said to her, "Our life for yours, if you don't talk

        about this business of ours; and it shall be, when Yahweh gives

        us the land, that we will deal kindly and truly with you."

002:015 Then she let them down by a cord through the window;

        for her house was on the side of the wall, and she lived

        on the wall.

002:016 She said to them, "Go to the mountain, lest the pursuers find you;

        and hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers

        have returned.  Afterward, you may go your way."

002:017 The men said to her, "We will be guiltless of this your oath

        which you have made us to swear.

002:018 Behold, when we come into the land, you shall bind this line

        of scarlet thread in the window which you did let us down by.

        You shall gather to yourself into the house your father,

        your mother, your brothers, and all your father's household.

002:019 It shall be that whoever goes out of the doors of your house into

        the street, his blood will be on his head, and we will be guiltless.

        Whoever is with you in the house, his blood shall be on our head,

        if any hand is on him.

002:020 But if you talk about this business of ours, then we shall

        be guiltless of your oath which you have made us to swear."

002:021 She said, "According to your words, so be it."  She sent them away,

        and they departed.  She tied the scarlet line in the window.

002:022 They went, and came to the mountain, and stayed there three days,

        until the pursuers had returned.  The pursuers sought them

        throughout all the way, but didn't find them.

002:023 Then the two men returned, descended from the mountain,

        passed over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun; and they told

        him all that had happened to them.

002:024 They said to Joshua, "Truly Yahweh has delivered into our hands

        all the land.  Moreover, all the inhabitants of the land melt

        away before us."

003:001 Joshua rose up early in the morning; and they moved from Shittim,

        and came to the Jordan, he and all the children of Israel.

        They lodged there before they passed over.

003:002 It happened after three days, that the officers went through

        the midst of the camp;

003:003 and they commanded the people, saying, "When you see the ark

        of the covenant of Yahweh your God, and the priests

        the Levites bearing it, then you shall move from your place,

        and follow it.

003:004 Yet there shall be a space between you and it, about two

        thousand cubits by measure.  Don't come near to it, that you

        may know the way by which you must go; for you have not passed

        this way before."

003:005 Joshua said to the people, "Sanctify yourselves; for tomorrow

        Yahweh will do wonders among you."

003:006 Joshua spoke to the priests, saying, "Take up the ark

        of the covenant, and pass over before the people."

        They took up the ark of the covenant, and went before the people.

003:007 Yahweh said to Joshua, "Today I will begin to magnify you

        in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that as I

        was with Moses, so I will be with you.

003:008 You shall command the priests who bear the ark of the covenant,

        saying, 'When you come to the brink of the waters of the Jordan,

        you shall stand still in the Jordan.'"

003:009 Joshua said to the children of Israel, "Come here, and hear

        the words of Yahweh your God."

003:010 Joshua said, "Hereby you shall know that the living God is

        among you, and that he will without fail drive the Canaanite,

        and the Hittite, and the Hivite, and the Perizzite,

        and the Girgashite, and the Amorite, and the Jebusite out

        from before you.

003:011 Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth

        passes over before you into the Jordan.

003:012 Now therefore take twelve men out of the tribes of Israel,

        for every tribe a man.

003:013 It shall come to pass, when the soles of the feet of the priests

        who bear the ark of Yahweh, the Lord of all the earth,

        rest in the waters of the Jordan, that the waters of the Jordan

        will be cut off, even the waters that come down from above;

        and they shall stand in one heap."

003:014 It happened, when the people moved from their tents to pass

        over the Jordan, the priests who bore the ark of the covenant

        being before the people,

003:015 and when those who bore the ark had come to the Jordan,

        and the feet of the priests who bore the ark had dipped

        in the edge of the water (for the Jordan overflows all its

        banks all the time of harvest),

003:016 that the waters which came down from above stood, and rose

        up in one heap, a great way off, at Adam, the city that is

        beside Zarethan; and those that went down toward the sea

        of the Arabah, even the Salt Sea, were wholly cut off.

        Then the people passed over right against Jericho.

003:017 The priests who bore the ark of the covenant of Yahweh

        stood firm on dry ground in the middle of the Jordan;

        and all Israel passed over on dry ground, until all the nation

        had passed completely over the Jordan.

004:001 It happened, when all the nation had completely passed over

        the Jordan, that Yahweh spoke to Joshua, saying,

004:002 "Take twelve men out of the people, out of every tribe a man,

004:003 and command them, saying, 'Take from out of the middle of

        the Jordan, out of the place where the priests' feet stood firm,

        twelve stones, and carry them over with you, and lay them

        down in the lodging place, where you will lodge tonight.'"

004:004 Then Joshua called the twelve men, whom he had prepared

        of the children of Israel, out of every tribe a man.

004:005 Joshua said to them, "Pass over before the ark of Yahweh your

        God into the middle of the Jordan, and each of you pick up

        a stone and put it on your shoulder, according to the number

        of the tribes of the children of Israel;

004:006 that this may be a sign among you, that when your children ask

        in time to come, saying, 'What do you mean by these stones?'

004:007 then you shall tell them, 'Because the waters of the Jordan

        were cut off before the ark of the covenant of Yahweh.

        When it passed over the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were

        cut off.  These stones shall be for a memorial to the children

        of Israel forever.'"

004:008 The children of Israel did as Joshua commanded, and took up twelve

        stones out of the middle of the Jordan, as Yahweh spoke to Joshua,

        according to the number of the tribes of the children of Israel;

        and they carried them over with them to the place where they lodged,

        and laid them down there.

004:009 Joshua set up twelve stones in the middle of the Jordan,

        in the place where the feet of the priests who bore the ark

        of the covenant stood; and they are there to this day.

004:010 For the priests who bore the ark stood in the middle of the Jordan,

        until everything was finished that Yahweh commanded Joshua to speak

        to the people, according to all that Moses commanded Joshua;

        and the people hurried and passed over.

004:011 It happened, when all the people had completely passed over,

        that the ark of Yahweh passed over, with the priests,

        in the presence of the people.

004:012 The children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and the half-tribe

        of Manasseh, passed over armed before the children of Israel,

        as Moses spoke to them.

004:013 About forty thousand men, ready and armed for war passed

        over before Yahweh to battle, to the plains of Jericho.

004:014 On that day, Yahweh magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel;

        and they feared him, as they feared Moses, all the days

        of his life.

004:015 Yahweh spoke to Joshua, saying,

004:016 "Command the priests who bear the ark of the testimony,

        that they come up out of the Jordan."

004:017 Joshua therefore commanded the priests, saying, "Come up out

        of the Jordan!"

004:018 It happened, when the priests who bore the ark of the covenant

        of Yahweh had come up out of the middle of the Jordan,

        and the soles of the priests' feet were lifted up to the dry ground,

        that the waters of the Jordan returned to their place,

        and went over all its banks, as before.

004:019 The people came up out of the Jordan on the tenth day

        of the first month, and encamped in Gilgal, on the east

        border of Jericho.

004:020 Joshua set up those twelve stones, which they took out of

        the Jordan, n Gilgal.

004:021 He spoke to the children of Israel, saying, "When your

        children ask their fathers in time to come, saying, 'What do

        these stones mean?'

004:022 Then you shall let your children know, saying, 'Israel came

        over this Jordan on dry land.

004:023 For Yahweh your God dried up the waters of the Jordan from

        before you, until you had passed over, as Yahweh your God

        did to the Red Sea{or, Sea of Reeds}, which he dried up

        from before us, until we had passed over;

004:024 that all the peoples of the earth may know the hand of Yahweh,

        that it is mighty; that you may fear Yahweh your God forever.'"

005:001 It happened, when all the kings of the Amorites, who were beyond

        the Jordan westward, and all the kings of the Canaanites,

        who were by the sea, heard how that Yahweh had dried up

        the waters of the Jordan from before the children of Israel,

        until we had passed over, that their heart melted, neither was

        there spirit in them any more, because of the children of Israel.

005:002 At that time, Yahweh said to Joshua, "Make flint knives,

        and circumcise again the children of Israel the second time."

005:003 Joshua made himself flint knives, and circumcised the children

        of Israel at the hill of the foreskins.

005:004 This is the reason Joshua circumcised:  all the people who came

        out of Egypt, who were males, even all the men of war,

        died in the wilderness by the way, after they came out of Egypt.

005:005 For all the people who came out were circumcised; but all

        the people who were born in the wilderness by the way as they

        came out of Egypt had not been circumcised.

005:006 For the children of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness,

        until all the nation, even the men of war who came out of Egypt,

        were consumed, because they didn't listen to the voice of Yahweh.

        Yahweh swore to them that he wouldn't let them see the land

        which Yahweh swore to their fathers that he would give us,

        a land flowing with milk and honey.

005:007 Their children, whom he raised up in their place,

        were circumcised by Joshua; for they were uncircumcised,

        because they had not circumcised them on the way.

005:008 It happened, when they were done circumcising all the nation,

        that they stayed in their places in the camp until

        they were healed.

005:009 Yahweh said to Joshua, "Today I have rolled away the reproach

        of Egypt from off you."  Therefore the name of that place

        was called Gilgal,{"Gilgal" sounds like the Hebrew for "roll."

        } to this day.

005:010 The children of Israel encamped in Gilgal.  They kept

        the Passover on the fourteenth day of the month at evening

        in the plains of Jericho.

005:011 They ate unleavened cakes and parched grain of the produce

        of the land on the next day after the Passover, in the same day.

005:012 The manna ceased on the next day, after they had eaten of the produce

        of the land.  The children of Israel didn't have manna any more;

        but they ate of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.

005:013 It happened, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up

        his eyes and looked, and behold, a man stood in front of him

        with his sword drawn in his hand.  Joshua went to him,

        and said to him, "Are you for us, or for our adversaries?"

005:014 He said, "No; but I have come now as commander of Yahweh's army."

        Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and worshipped,

        and said to him, "What does my lord say to his servant?"

005:015 The prince of Yahweh's army said to Joshua, "Take your shoes

        off of your feet; for the place on which you stand is holy."

        Joshua did so.

006:001 Now Jericho was tightly shut up because of the children of Israel.

        No one went out, and no one came in.

006:002 Yahweh said to Joshua, "Behold, I have given Jericho into your hand,

        with its king and the mighty men of valor.

006:003 All your men of war shall march around the city, going around

        the city once.  You shall do this six days.

006:004 Seven priests shall bear seven trumpets of rams' horns before

        the ark.  On the seventh day, you shall march around the city

        seven times, and the priests shall blow the trumpets.

006:005 It shall be that when they make a long blast with the ram's horn,

        and when you hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people

        shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city

        shall fall down flat, and the people shall go up every man

        straight before him."

006:006 Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said to them,

        "Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear

        seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of Yahweh."

006:007 They said to the people, "Advance!  March around the city,

        and let the armed men pass on before Yahweh's ark."

006:008 It was so, that when Joshua had spoken to the people,

        the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams'

        horns before Yahweh advanced, and blew the trumpets;

        and the ark of the covenant of Yahweh followed them.

006:009 The armed men went before the priests who blew the trumpets,

        and the ark went after them.  The trumpets sounded as they went.

006:010 Joshua commanded the people, saying, "You shall not shout,

        nor let your voice be heard, neither shall any word proceed

        out of your mouth, until the day I tell you to shout.

        Then you shall shout."

006:011 So he caused the ark of Yahweh to go around the city,

        going about it once.  Then they came into the camp, and lodged

        in the camp.

006:012 Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up

        the ark of Yahweh.

006:013 The seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams'

        horns before the ark of Yahweh went on continually,

        and blew the trumpets:  and the armed men went before them.

        The rear guard came after the ark of Yahweh.  The trumpets

        sounded as they went.

006:014 The second day they marched around the city once, and returned

        into the camp.  They did this six days.

006:015 It happened on the seventh day, that they rose early at the dawning

        of the day, and marched around the city in the same way seven times.

        Only on this day they marched around the city seven times.

006:016 It happened at the seventh time, when the priests blew the trumpets,

        Joshua said to the people, "Shout, for Yahweh has given

        you the city!

006:017 The city shall be devoted, even it and all that is in it, to Yahweh.

        Only Rahab the prostitute shall live, she and all who are with

        her in the house, because she hid the messengers that we sent.

006:018 But as for you, only keep yourselves from the devoted thing,

        lest when you have devoted it, you take of the devoted thing;

        so would you make the camp of Israel accursed, and trouble it.

006:019 But all the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron,

        are holy to Yahweh.  They shall come into Yahweh's treasury."

006:020 So the people shouted, and the priests blew the trumpets.

        It happened, when the people heard the sound of the trumpet,

        that the people shouted with a great shout, and the wall

        fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city,

        every man straight before him, and they took the city.

006:021 They utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man

        and woman, both young and old, and ox, and sheep, and donkey,

        with the edge of the sword.

006:022 Joshua said to the two men who had spied out the land,

        "Go into the prostitute's house, and bring out from there

        the woman and all that she has, as you swore to her."

006:023 The young men who were spies went in, and brought out Rahab

        with her father, her mother, her brothers, and all that she had.

        They also brought out all her relatives, and they set them

        outside of the camp of Israel.

006:024 They burnt the city with fire, and all that was in it.

        Only they put the silver, the gold, and the vessels of brass

        and of iron into the treasury of Yahweh's house.

006:025 But Rahab the prostitute, her father's household, and all

        that she had, Joshua saved alive.  She lived in the midst

        of Israel to this day, because she hid the messengers,

        whom Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.

006:026 Joshua charged them with an oath at that time, saying, "Cursed be

        the man before Yahweh, who rises up and builds this city Jericho.

        With the loss of his firstborn shall he lay its foundation,

        and with the loss of his youngest son shall he set up its gates."

006:027 So Yahweh was with Joshua; and his fame was in all the land.

007:001 But the children of Israel committed a trespass in the devoted thing;

        for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son

        of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of the devoted thing:

        and the anger of Yahweh was kindled against the children of Israel.

007:002 Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside Beth Aven,

        on the east side of Bethel, and spoke to them, saying, Go up

        and spy out the land.  The men went up and spied out Ai.

007:003 They returned to Joshua, and said to him, Don't let all

        the people go up; but let about two or three thousand men go

        up and strike Ai; don't make all the people to toil there;

        for they are but few.

007:004 So there went up there of the people about three thousand men:

        and they fled before the men of Ai.

007:005 The men of Ai struck of them about thirty-six men; and they

        chased them [from] before the gate even to Shebarim, and struck

        them at the descent; and the hearts of the people melted,

        and became as water.

007:006 Joshua tore his clothes, and fell to the earth on his face before

        the ark of Yahweh until the evening, he and the elders of Israel;

        and they put dust on their heads.

007:007 Joshua said, Alas, Lord Yahweh, why have you at all brought

        this people over the Jordan, to deliver us into the hand

        of the Amorites, to cause us to perish? would that we had been

        content and lived beyond the Jordan!

007:008 Oh, Lord, what shall I say, after that Israel has turned

        their backs before their enemies!

007:009 For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will

        hear of it, and will compass us round, and cut off our name

        from the earth:  and what will you do for your great name?

007:010 Yahweh said to Joshua, Get you up; why are you thus fallen

        on your face?

007:011 Israel has sinned; yes, they have even transgressed my

        covenant which I commanded them:  yes, they have even taken

        of the devoted thing, and have also stolen, and dissembled also;

        and they have even put it among their own stuff.

007:012 Therefore the children of Israel can't stand before their enemies;

        they turn their backs before their enemies, because they

        are become accursed:  I will not be with you any more,

        except you destroy the devoted thing from among you.

007:013 Up, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves

        against tomorrow:  for thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, There is

        a devoted thing in the midst of you, Israel; you can not stand

        before your enemies, until you take away the devoted thing

        from among you.

007:014 In the morning therefore you shall be brought near by your tribes:

        and it shall be, that the tribe which Yahweh takes shall come

        near by families; and the family which Yahweh shall take

        shall come near by households; and the household which Yahweh

        shall take shall come near man by man.

007:015 It shall be, that he who is taken with the devoted thing shall

        be burnt with fire, he and all that he has; because he has

        transgressed the covenant of Yahweh, and because he has done

        folly in Israel.

007:016 So Joshua rose up early in the morning, and brought Israel

        near by their tribes; and the tribe of Judah was taken:

007:017 and he brought near the family of Judah; and he took the family

        of the Zerahites:  and he brought near the family of the Zerahites

        man by man; and Zabdi was taken:

007:018 and he brought near his household man by man; and Achan,

        the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah,

        of the tribe of Judah, was taken.

007:019 Joshua said to Achan, My son, please give glory to Yahweh,

        the God of Israel, and make confession to him; and tell me

        now what you have done; don't hide it from me.

007:020 Achan answered Joshua, and said, Of a truth I have sinned

        against Yahweh, the God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done:

007:021 when I saw among the spoil a goodly Babylonian mantle,

        and two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold

        of fifty shekels weight, then I coveted them, and took them;

        and, behold, they are hid in the earth in the midst of my tent,

        and the silver under it.

007:022 So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent; and, behold,

        it was hid in his tent, and the silver under it.

007:023 They took them from the midst of the tent, and brought them

        to Joshua, and to all the children of Israel; and they laid

        them down before Yahweh.

007:024 Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah,

        and the silver, and the mantle, and the wedge of gold,

        and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his donkeys,

        and his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had:

        and they brought them up to the valley of Achor.

007:025 Joshua said, Why have you troubled us?  Yahweh shall

        trouble you this day.  All Israel stoned him with stones;

        and they burned them with fire, and stoned them with stones.

007:026 They raised over him a great heap of stones, to this day;

        and Yahweh turned from the fierceness of his anger.

        Therefore the name of that place was called "The valley of Achor"

        to this day.

008:001 Yahweh said to Joshua, Don't be afraid, neither be dismayed:

        take all the people of war with you, and arise, go up

        to Ai; behold, I have given into your hand the king of Ai,

        and his people, and his city, and his land;

008:002 You shall do to Ai and her king as you did to Jericho and her king:

        only the spoil of it, and the livestock of it, shall you

        take for a prey to yourselves:  set you an ambush for the

        city behind it.

008:003 So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up to Ai:

        and Joshua chose out thirty thousand men, the mighty men of valor,

        and sent them forth by night.

008:004 He commanded them, saying, Behold, you shall lie in ambush against

        the city, behind the city; don't go very far from the city,

        but be all ready:

008:005 and I, and all the people who are with me, will approach to the city.

        It shall happen, when they come out against us, as at the first,

        that we will flee before them;

008:006 and they will come out after us, until we have drawn them

        away from the city; for they will say, They flee before us,

        as at the first:  so we will flee before them;

008:007 and you shall rise up from the ambush, and take possession of

        the city:  for Yahweh your God will deliver it into your hand.

008:008 It shall be, when you have seized on the city, that you shall set

        the city on fire; according to the word of Yahweh shall you do:

        behold, I have commanded you.

008:009 Joshua sent them forth; and they went to set up the ambush,

        and stayed between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of Ai:

        but Joshua lodged that night among the people.

008:010 Joshua arose up early in the morning, and mustered the people,

        and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai.

008:011 All the people, [even] the [men of] war who were with him,

        went up, and drew near, and came before the city, and encamped

        on the north side of Ai:  now there was a valley between

        him and Ai.

008:012 He took about five thousand men, and set them in ambush between

        Bethel and Ai, on the west side of the city.

008:013 So they set the people, even all the army who was on the north

        of the city, and their ambush on the west of the city;

        and Joshua went that night into the midst of the valley.

008:014 It happened, when the king of Ai saw it, that they hurried

        and rose up early, and the men of the city went out against

        Israel to battle, he and all his people, at the time appointed,

        before the Arabah; but he didn't know that there was an ambush

        against him behind the city.

008:015 Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before them,

        and fled by the way of the wilderness.

008:016 All the people who were in the city were called together

        to pursue after them:  and they pursued after Joshua,

        and were drawn away from the city.

008:017 There was not a man left in Ai or Beth El, who didn't

        go out after Israel:  and they left the city open,

        and pursued after Israel.

008:018 Yahweh said to Joshua, Stretch out the javelin that is in

        your hand toward Ai; for I will give it into your hand.

        Joshua stretched out the javelin that was in his hand

        toward the city.

008:019 The ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran as soon

        as he had stretched out his hand, and entered into the city,

        and took it; and they hurried and set the city on fire.

008:020 When the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and behold,

        the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven, and they had no

        power to flee this way or that way:  and the people who fled

        to the wilderness turned back on the pursuers.

008:021 When Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city,

        and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they turned again,

        and killed the men of Ai.

008:022 The others came forth out of the city against them;

        so they were in the midst of Israel, some on this side,

        and some on that side:  and they struck them, so that they

        let none of them remain or escape.

008:023 The king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua.

008:024 It happened, when Israel had made an end of killing all the

        inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness in which they

        pursued them, and they were all fallen by the edge of the sword,

        until they were consumed, that all Israel returned to Ai,

        and struck it with the edge of the sword.

008:025 All that fell that day, both of men and women, were twelve thousand,

        even all the men of Ai.

008:026 For Joshua didn't draw back his hand, with which he stretched

        out the javelin, until he had utterly destroyed all the

        inhabitants of Ai.

008:027 Only the livestock and the spoil of that city Israel took

        for prey to themselves, according to the word of Yahweh

        which he commanded Joshua.

008:028 So Joshua burnt Ai, and made it a heap forever, even a desolation,

        to this day.

008:029 The king of Ai he hanged on a tree until the evening:

        and at the going down of the sun Joshua commanded, and they

        took his body down from the tree, and cast it at the entrance

        of the gate of the city, and raised thereon a great heap

        of stones, to this day.

008:030 Then Joshua built an altar to Yahweh, the God of Israel,

        in Mount Ebal,

008:031 as Moses the servant of Yahweh commanded the children of Israel,

        as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, an altar

        of uncut stones, on which no man had lifted up any iron:

        and they offered thereon burnt offerings to Yahweh,

        and sacrificed peace offerings.

008:032 He wrote there on the stones a copy of the law of Moses,

        which he wrote, in the presence of the children of Israel.

008:033 All Israel, and their elders and officers, and their judges,

        stood on this side of the ark and on that side before the priests

        the Levites, who bore the ark of the covenant of Yahweh,

        as well the foreigner as the native; half of them in front

        of Mount Gerizim, and half of them in front of Mount Ebal;

        as Moses the servant of Yahweh had commanded at the first,

        that they should bless the people of Israel.

008:034 Afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessing

        and the curse, according to all that is written in the book

        of the law.

008:035 There was not a word of all that Moses commanded, which Joshua

        didn't read before all the assembly of Israel, and the women,

        and the little ones, and the foreigners who were among them.

009:001 It happened, when all the kings who were beyond the Jordan,

        in the hill country, and in the lowland, and on all the shore

        of the great sea in front of Lebanon, the Hittite, and the Amorite,

        the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite,

        heard of it;

009:002 that they gathered themselves together, to fight with Joshua

        and with Israel, with one accord.

009:003 But when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done

        to Jericho and to Ai,

009:004 they also resorted to a ruse, and went and made as if they

        had been ambassadors, and took old sacks on their donkeys,

        and wineskins, old and torn and bound up,

009:005 and old and patched shoes on their feet, and old garments on them;

        and all the bread of their provision was dry and was become moldy.

009:006 They went to Joshua to the camp at Gilgal, and said to him,

        and to the men of Israel, We are come from a far country:

        now therefore make you a covenant with us.

009:007 The men of Israel said to the Hivites, What if you dwell among us;

        and how shall we make a covenant with you?

009:008 They said to Joshua, We are your servants.  Joshua said to them,

        Who are you? and from whence come you?

009:009 They said to him, From a very far country your servants

        are come because of the name of Yahweh your God:

        for we have heard the fame of him, and all that he did in Egypt,

009:010 and all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites,

        who were beyond the Jordan, to Sihon king of Heshbon,

        and to Og king of Bashan, who was at Ashtaroth.

009:011 Our elders and all the inhabitants of our country spoke

        to us, saying, Take provision in your hand for the journey,

        and go to meet them, and tell them, We are your servants:

        and now make you a covenant with us.

009:012 This our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses

        on the day we came forth to go to you; but now, behold, it is dry,

        and is become moldy:

009:013 and these wineskins, which we filled, were new; and behold,

        they are torn:  and these our garments and our shoes are become

        old by reason of the very long journey.

009:014 The men took of their provision, and didn't ask counsel at

        the mouth of Yahweh.

009:015 Joshua made peace with them, and made a covenant with them,

        to let them live:  and the princes of the congregation

        swore to them.

009:016 It happened at the end of three days after they had made a covenant

        with them, that they heard that they were their neighbors,

        and that they lived among them.

009:017 The children of Israel traveled, and came to their cities on

        the third day.  Now their cities were Gibeon, and Chephirah,

        and Beeroth, and Kiriath Jearim.

009:018 The children of Israel didn't strike them, because the princes

        of the congregation had sworn to them by Yahweh, the God of Israel.

        All the congregation murmured against the princes.

009:019 But all the princes said to all the congregation,

        We have sworn to them by Yahweh, the God of Israel:

        now therefore we may not touch them.

009:020 This we will do to them, and let them live; lest wrath be on us,

        because of the oath which we swore to them.

009:021 The princes said to them, Let them live:  so they became

        wood cutters and drawers of water to all the congregation,

        as the princes had spoken to them.

009:022 Joshua called for them, and he spoke to them, saying,

        Why have you deceived us, saying, We are very far from you;

        when you dwell among us?

009:023 Now therefore you are cursed, and there shall never fail to be

        of you bondservants, both wood cutters and drawers of water

        for the house of my God.

009:024 They answered Joshua, and said, Because it was certainly

        told your servants, how that Yahweh your God commanded

        his servant Moses to give you all the land, and to

        destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you;

        therefore we were sore afraid for our lives because of you,

        and have done this thing.

009:025 Now, behold, we are in your hand:  as it seems good and right

        to you to do to us, do.

009:026 So did he to them, and delivered them out of the hand of

        the children of Israel, that they didn't kill them.

009:027 That day Joshua made those wood cutters and drawers of water

        for the congregation, and for the altar of Yahweh, to this day,

        in the place which he should choose.

010:001 Now it happened, when Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem heard how Joshua

        had taken Ai, and had utterly destroyed it; as he had done

        to Jericho and her king, so he had done to Ai and her king;

        and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel,

        and were among them;

010:002 that they feared greatly, because Gibeon was a great city,

        as one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai,

        and all the men of it were mighty.

010:003 Therefore Adoni-Zedek king of Jerusalem sent to Hoham king of Hebron,

        and to Piram king of Jarmuth, and to Japhia king of Lachish,

        and to Debir king of Eglon, saying,

010:004 Come up to me, and help me, and let us strike Gibeon; for it

        has made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel.

010:005 Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem,

        the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish,

        the king of Eglon, gathered themselves together, and went up,

        they and all their armies, and encamped against Gibeon,

        and made war against it.

010:006 The men of Gibeon sent to Joshua to the camp to Gilgal,

        saying, Don't slack your hand from your servants;

        come up to us quickly, and save us, and help us:

        for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell in the hill

        country are gathered together against us.

010:007 So Joshua went up from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war

        with him, and all the mighty men of valor.

010:008 Yahweh said to Joshua, Don't fear them:  for I have delivered

        them into your hands; there shall not a man of them

        stand before you.

010:009 Joshua therefore came on them suddenly; [for] he went up

        from Gilgal all the night.

010:010 Yahweh confused them before Israel, and he killed them

        with a great slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them by the way

        of the ascent of Beth Horon, and struck them to Azekah,

        and to Makkedah.

010:011 It happened, as they fled from before Israel, while they

        were at the descent of Beth Horon, that Yahweh cast down

        great stones from the sky on them to Azekah, and they died:

        they were more who died with the hailstones than they whom

        the children of Israel killed with the sword.

010:012 Then spoke Joshua to Yahweh in the day when Yahweh

        delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel;

        and he said in the sight of Israel, Sun, stand you still

        on Gibeon; You, Moon, in the valley of Aijalon.

010:013 The sun stood still, and the moon stayed, Until the nation

        had avenged themselves of their enemies.  Isn't this written

        in the book of Jashar?  The sun stayed in the midst of the sky,

        and didn't hurry to go down about a whole day.

010:014 There was no day like that before it or after it, that Yahweh

        listened to the voice of a man:  for Yahweh fought for Israel.

010:015 Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp to Gilgal.

010:016 These five kings fled, and hid themselves in the cave at Makkedah.

010:017 It was told Joshua, saying, The five kings are found,

        hidden in the cave at Makkedah.

010:018 Joshua said, Roll great stones to the mouth of the cave,

        and set men by it to keep them:

010:019 but don't stay; pursue after your enemies, and strike the hindmost

        of them; don't allow them to enter into their cities:

        for Yahweh your God has delivered them into your hand.

010:020 It happened, when Joshua and the children of Israel had

        made an end of killing them with a very great slaughter,

        until they were consumed, and the remnant which remained

        of them had entered into the fortified cities,

010:021 that all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at

        Makkedah in peace:  none moved his tongue against any of

        the children of Israel.

010:022 Then said Joshua, Open the mouth of the cave, and bring forth

        those five kings to me out of the cave.

010:023 They did so, and brought forth those five kings to him out

        of the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron,

        the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon.

010:024 It happened, when they brought forth those kings to Joshua,

        that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said

        to the chiefs of the men of war who went with him,

        Come near, put your feet on the necks of these kings.

        They came near, and put their feet on the necks of them.

010:025 Joshua said to them, Don't be afraid, nor be dismayed;

        be strong and of good courage:  for thus shall Yahweh do

        to all your enemies against whom you fight.

010:026 Afterward Joshua struck them, and put them to death, and hanged

        them on five trees:  and they were hanging on the trees

        until the evening.

010:027 It happened at the time of the going down of the sun,

        that Joshua commanded, and they took them down off the trees,

        and cast them into the cave in which they had hidden themselves,

        and laid great stones on the mouth of the cave, to this very day.

010:028 Joshua took Makkedah on that day, and struck it with the edge

        of the sword, and the king of it:  he utterly destroyed them

        and all the souls who were therein; he left none remaining;

        and he did to the king of Makkedah as he had done to the

        king of Jericho.

010:029 Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him, to Libnah,

        and fought against Libnah:

010:030 and Yahweh delivered it also, and the king of it, into the hand

        of Israel; and he struck it with the edge of the sword,

        and all the souls who were therein; he left none remaining in it;

        and he did to the king of it as he had done to the king of Jericho.

010:031 Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him, to Lachish,

        and encamped against it, and fought against it:

010:032 and Yahweh delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel;

        and he took it on the second day, and struck it with

        the edge of the sword, and all the souls who were therein,

        according to all that he had done to Libnah.

010:033 Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua

        struck him and his people, until he had left him none remaining.

010:034 Joshua passed from Lachish, and all Israel with him, to Eglon;

        and they encamped against it, and fought against it;

010:035 and they took it on that day, and struck it with the edge

        of the sword; and all the souls who were therein he utterly

        destroyed that day, according to all that he had done to Lachish.

010:036 Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him, to Hebron;

        and they fought against it:

010:037 and they took it, and struck it with the edge of the sword,

        and the king of it, and all the cities of it, and all the souls

        who were therein; he left none remaining, according to all

        that he had done to Eglon; but he utterly destroyed it,

        and all the souls who were therein.

010:038 Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir,

        and fought against it:

010:039 and he took it, and the king of it, and all the cities of it;

        and they struck them with the edge of the sword, and utterly

        destroyed all the souls who were therein; he left none remaining:

        as he had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir, and to the king of it;

        as he had done also to Libnah, and to the king of it.

010:040 So Joshua struck all the land, the hill country, and the South,

        and the lowland, and the slopes, and all their kings:

        he left none remaining, but he utterly destroyed all that breathed,

        as Yahweh, the God of Israel, commanded.

010:041 Joshua struck them from Kadesh Barnea even to Gaza, and all

        the country of Goshen, even to Gibeon.

010:042 All these kings and their land did Joshua take at one time,

        because Yahweh, the God of Israel, fought for Israel.

010:043 Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to the camp to Gilgal.

011:001 It happened, when Jabin king of Hazor heard of it, that he sent

        to Jobab king of Madon, and to the king of Shimron,

        and to the king of Achshaph,

011:002 and to the kings who were on the north, in the hill country,

        and in the Arabah south of Chinneroth, and in the lowland,

        and in the heights of Dor on the west,

011:003 to the Canaanite on the east and on the west, and the Amorite,

        and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite in the

        hill country, and the Hivite under Hermon in the land of Mizpah.

011:004 They went out, they and all their armies with them, much people,

        even as the sand that is on the seashore in multitude,

        with horses and chariots very many.

011:005 All these kings met together; and they came and encamped

        together at the waters of Merom, to fight with Israel.

011:006 Yahweh said to Joshua, Don't be afraid because of them;

        for tomorrow at this time will I deliver them up all slain

        before Israel:  you shall hamstring their horses, and burn

        their chariots with fire.

011:007 So Joshua came, and all the people of war with him, against them

        by the waters of Merom suddenly, and fell on them.

011:008 Yahweh delivered them into the hand of Israel, and they struck them,

        and chased them to great Sidon, and to Misrephoth Maim,

        and to the valley of Mizpeh eastward; and they struck them,

        until they left them none remaining.

011:009 Joshua did to them as Yahweh bade him:  he hamstrung their horses,

        and burnt their chariots with fire.

011:010 Joshua turned back at that time, and took Hazor, and struck

        the king of it with the sword:  for Hazor before was the head

        of all those kingdoms.

011:011 They struck all the souls who were therein with the edge of the sword,

        utterly destroying them; there was none left who breathed:

        and he burnt Hazor with fire.

011:012 All the cities of those kings, and all the kings of them,

        did Joshua take, and he struck them with the edge of

        the sword, and utterly destroyed them; as Moses the servant

        of Yahweh commanded.

011:013 But as for the cities that stood on their mounds, Israel burned

        none of them, save Hazor only; that did Joshua burn.

011:014 All the spoil of these cities, and the livestock, the children

        of Israel took for a prey to themselves; but every man they

        struck with the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them,

        neither left they any who breathed.

011:015 As Yahweh commanded Moses his servant, so did Moses command Joshua:

        and so did Joshua; he left nothing undone of all that

        Yahweh commanded Moses.

011:016 So Joshua took all that land, the hill country, and all the South,

        and all the land of Goshen, and the lowland, and the Arabah,

        and the hill country of Israel, and the lowland of the same;

011:017 from Mount Halak, that goes up to Seir, even to Baal Gad

        in the valley of Lebanon under Mount Hermon:  and all their

        kings he took, and struck them, and put them to death.

011:018 Joshua made war a long time with all those kings.

011:019 There was not a city that made peace with the children

        of Israel, save the Hivites the inhabitants of Gibeon:

        they took all in battle.

011:020 For it was of Yahweh to harden their hearts, to come against

        Israel in battle, that he might utterly destroy them,

        that they might have no favor, but that he might destroy them,

        as Yahweh commanded Moses.

011:021 Joshua came at that time, and cut off the Anakim from the

        hill country, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from

        all the hill country of Judah, and from all the hill country

        of Israel:  Joshua utterly destroyed them with their cities.

011:022 There was none of the Anakim left in the land of the children

        of Israel:  only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod,

        did some remain.

011:023 So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that Yahweh

        spoke to Moses; and Joshua gave it for an inheritance

        to Israel according to their divisions by their tribes.

        The land had rest from war.

012:001 Now these are the kings of the land, whom the children of

        Israel struck, and possessed their land beyond the Jordan toward

        the sunrise, from the valley of the Arnon to Mount Hermon,

        and all the Arabah eastward:

012:002 Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon, and ruled

        from Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon,

        and [the city that is in] the middle of the valley, and half Gilead,

        even to the river Jabbok, the border of the children of Ammon;

012:003 and the Arabah to the sea of Chinneroth, eastward, and to

        the sea of the Arabah, even the Salt Sea, eastward, the way

        to Beth Jeshimoth; and on the south, under the slopes of Pisgah:

012:004 and the border of Og king of Bashan, of the remnant of the Rephaim,

        who lived at Ashtaroth and at Edrei,

012:005 and ruled in Mount Hermon, and in Salecah, and in all Bashan,

        to the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites,

        and half Gilead, the border of Sihon king of Heshbon.

012:006 Moses the servant of Yahweh and the children of Israel struck them:

        and Moses the servant of Yahweh gave it for a possession to

        the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh.

012:007 These are the kings of the land whom Joshua and the children

        of Israel struck beyond the Jordan westward, from Baal Gad in

        the valley of Lebanon even to Mount Halak, that goes up to Seir;

        and Joshua gave it to the tribes of Israel for a possession

        according to their divisions;

012:008 in the hill country, and in the lowland, and in the Arabah,

        and in the slopes, and in the wilderness, and in the South;

        the Hittite, the Amorite, and the Canaanite, the Perizzite,

        the Hivite, and the Jebusite:

012:009 the king of Jericho, one; the king of Ai, which is beside Bethel, one;

012:010 the king of Jerusalem, one; the king of Hebron, one;

012:011 the king of Jarmuth, one; the king of Lachish, one;

012:012 the king of Eglon, one; the king of Gezer, one;

012:013 the king of Debir, one; the king of Geder, one;

012:014 the king of Hormah, one; the king of Arad, one;

012:015 the king of Libnah, one; the king of Adullam, one;

012:016 the king of Makkedah, one; the king of Bethel, one;

012:017 the king of Tappuah, one; the king of Hepher, one;

012:018 the king of Aphek, one; the king of Lassharon, one;

012:019 the king of Madon, one; the king of Hazor, one;

012:020 the king of Shimron Meron, one; the king of Achshaph, one;

012:021 the king of Taanach, one; the king of Megiddo, one;

012:022 the king of Kedesh, one; the king of Jokneam in Carmel, one;

012:023 the king of Dor in the height of Dor, one; the king of Goiim

        in Gilgal, one;

012:024 the king of Tirzah, one:  all the kings thirty-one.

013:001 Now Joshua was old and well stricken in years; and Yahweh said

        to him, You are old and well stricken in years, and there

        remains yet very much land to be possessed.

013:002 This is the land that yet remains:  all the regions of

        the Philistines, and all the Geshurites;

013:003 from the Shihor, which is before Egypt, even to the border

        of Ekron northward, [which] is reckoned to the Canaanites;

        the five lords of the Philistines; the Gazites, and the Ashdodites,

        the Ashkelonites, the Gittites, and the Ekronites;

        also the Avvim,

013:004 on the south; all the land of the Canaanites, and Mearah

        that belongs to the Sidonians, to Aphek, to the border

        of the Amorites;

013:005 and the land of the Gebalites, and all Lebanon, toward the sunrise,

        from Baal Gad under Mount Hermon to the entrance of Hamath;

013:006 all the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon to

        Misrephoth Maim, even all the Sidonians; them will I drive

        out from before the children of Israel:  only allot you it

        to Israel for an inheritance, as I have commanded you.

013:007 Now therefore divide this land for an inheritance to the nine tribes,

        and the half-tribe of Manasseh.

013:008 With him the Reubenites and the Gadites received their inheritance,

        which Moses gave them, beyond the Jordan eastward, even as Moses

        the servant of Yahweh gave them:

013:009 from Aroer, that is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon,

        and the city that is in the middle of the valley, and all

        the plain of Medeba to Dibon;

013:010 and all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned

        in Heshbon, to the border of the children of Ammon;

013:011 and Gilead, and the border of the Geshurites and Maacathites,

        and all Mount Hermon, and all Bashan to Salecah;

013:012 all the kingdom of Og in Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth

        and in Edrei (the same was left of the remnant of the Rephaim);

        for these did Moses strike, and drove them out.

013:013 Nevertheless the children of Israel didn't drive out the Geshurites,

        nor the Maacathites:  but Geshur and Maacath dwell in the midst

        of Israel to this day.

013:014 Only to the tribe of Levi he gave no inheritance; the offerings

        of Yahweh, the God of Israel, made by fire are his inheritance,

        as he spoke to him.

013:015 Moses gave to the tribe of the children of Reuben according

        to their families.

013:016 Their border was from Aroer, that is on the edge of the valley

        of the Arnon, and the city that is in the middle of the valley,

        and all the plain by Medeba;

013:017 Heshbon, and all its cities that are in the plain; Dibon,

        and Bamoth Baal, and Beth Baal Meon,

013:018 and Jahaz, and Kedemoth, and Mephaath,

013:019 and Kiriathaim, and Sibmah, and Zereth Shahar in the mount

        of the valley,

013:020 and Beth Peor, and the slopes of Pisgah, and Beth Jeshimoth,

013:021 and all the cities of the plain, and all the kingdom of Sihon

        king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, whom Moses struck

        with the chiefs of Midian, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur,

        and Reba, the princes of Sihon, who lived in the land.

013:022 Balaam also the son of Beor, the soothsayer, did the children

        of Israel kill with the sword among the rest of their slain.

013:023 The border of the children of Reuben was the Jordan, and the border

        [of it]. This was the inheritance of the children of Reuben

        according to their families, the cities and the villages of it.

013:024 Moses gave to the tribe of Gad, to the children of Gad,

        according to their families.

013:025 Their border was Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead,

        and half the land of the children of Ammon, to Aroer that

        is before Rabbah;

013:026 and from Heshbon to Ramath Mizpeh, and Betonim; and from Mahanaim

        to the border of Debir;

013:027 and in the valley, Beth Haram, and Beth Nimrah, and Succoth,

        and Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon,

        the Jordan and the border [of it], to the uttermost part

        of the sea of Chinnereth beyond the Jordan eastward.

013:028 This is the inheritance of the children of Gad according

        to their families, the cities and the villages of it.

013:029 Moses gave [inheritance] to the half-tribe of Manasseh:

        and it was for the half-tribe of the children of Manasseh

        according to their families.

013:030 Their border was from Mahanaim, all Bashan, all the kingdom

        of Og king of Bashan, and all the towns of Jair, which are

        in Bashan, sixty cities:

013:031 and half Gilead, and Ashtaroth, and Edrei, the cities of

        the kingdom of Og in Bashan, were for the children of Machir

        the son of Manasseh, even for the half of the children

        of Machir according to their families.

013:032 These are the inheritances which Moses distributed in the plains

        of Moab, beyond the Jordan at Jericho, eastward.

013:033 But to the tribe of Levi Moses gave no inheritance:  Yahweh, the God

        of Israel, is their inheritance, as he spoke to them.

014:001 These are the inheritances which the children of Israel

        took in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest,

        and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers'

        [houses] of the tribes of the children of Israel,

        distributed to them,

014:002 by the lot of their inheritance, as Yahweh commanded by Moses,

        for the nine tribes, and for the half-tribe.

014:003 For Moses had given the inheritance of the two tribes and

        the half-tribe beyond the Jordan:  but to the Levites he gave

        no inheritance among them.

014:004 For the children of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim:

        and they gave no portion to the Levites in the land,

        save cities to dwell in, with the suburbs of it for their

        livestock and for their substance.

014:005 As Yahweh commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did;

        and they divided the land.

014:006 Then the children of Judah drew near to Joshua in Gilgal:

        and Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite said to him,

        You know the thing that Yahweh spoke to Moses the man of God

        concerning me and concerning you in Kadesh Barnea.

014:007 Forty years old was I when Moses the servant of Yahweh sent

        me from Kadesh Barnea to spy out the land; and I brought him

        word again as it was in my heart.

014:008 Nevertheless my brothers who went up with me made the heart

        of the people melt; but I wholly followed Yahweh my God.

014:009 Moses swore on that day, saying, Surely the land whereon

        your foot has trodden shall be an inheritance to you and

        to your children forever, because you have wholly followed

        Yahweh my God.

014:010 Now, behold, Yahweh has kept me alive, as he spoke,

        these forty-five years, from the time that Yahweh spoke

        this word to Moses, while Israel walked in the wilderness:

        and now, behold, I am this day eighty-five years old.

014:011 As yet I am as strong this day as I as in the day that Moses sent me:

        as my strength was then, even so is my strength now, for war,

        and to go out and to come in.

014:012 Now therefore give me this hill country, of which Yahweh spoke

        in that day; for you heard in that day how the Anakim were there,

        and cities great and fortified:  it may be that Yahweh will

        be with me, and I shall drive them out, as Yahweh spoke.

014:013 Joshua blessed him; and he gave Hebron to Caleb the son

        of Jephunneh for an inheritance.

014:014 Therefore Hebron became the inheritance of Caleb the son

        of Jephunneh the Kenizzite to this day; because that he wholly

        followed Yahweh, the God of Israel.

014:015 Now the name of Hebron before was Kiriath Arba;

        [which Arba was] the greatest man among the Anakim.

        The land had rest from war.

015:001 The lot for the tribe of the children of Judah according to their

        families was to the border of Edom, even to the wilderness

        of Zin southward, at the uttermost part of the south.

015:002 Their south border was from the uttermost part of the Salt Sea,

        from the bay that looks southward;

015:003 and it went out southward of the ascent of Akrabbim, and passed

        along to Zin, and went up by the south of Kadesh Barnea,

        and passed along by Hezron, and went up to Addar, and turned

        about to Karka;

015:004 and it passed along to Azmon, and went out at the brook

        of Egypt; and the goings out of the border were at the sea:

        this shall be your south border.

015:005 The east border was the Salt Sea, even to the end of the Jordan.

        The border of the north quarter was from the bay of the sea

        at the end of the Jordan;

015:006 and the border went up to Beth Hoglah, and passed along by

        the north of Beth Arabah; and the border went up to the stone

        of Bohan the son of Reuben;

015:007 and the border went up to Debir from the valley of Achor,

        and so northward, looking toward Gilgal, that is over against

        the ascent of Adummim, which is on the south side of the river;

        and the border passed along to the waters of En Shemesh,

        and the goings out of it were at En Rogel;

015:008 and the border went up by the valley of the son of Hinnom

        to the side of the Jebusite southward (the same is Jerusalem);

        and the border went up to the top of the mountain that lies

        before the valley of Hinnom westward, which is at the uttermost

        part of the valley of Rephaim northward;

015:009 and the border extended from the top of the mountain

        to the spring of the waters of Nephtoah, and went out to

        the cities of Mount Ephron; and the border extended to Baalah

        (the same is Kiriath Jearim);

015:010 and the border turned about from Baalah westward to Mount Seir,

        and passed along to the side of Mount Jearim on the north

        (the same is Chesalon), and went down to Beth Shemesh,

        and passed along by Timnah;

015:011 and the border went out to the side of Ekron northward;

        and the border extended to Shikkeron, and passed along

        to Mount Baalah, and went out at Jabneel; and the goings

        out of the border were at the sea.

015:012 The west border was to the great sea, and the border [of it].

        This is the border of the children of Judah round about

        according to their families.

015:013 To Caleb the son of Jephunneh he gave a portion among the children

        of Judah, according to the commandment of Yahweh to Joshua,

        even Kiriath Arba, [which Arba was] the father of Anak

        (the same is Hebron).

015:014 Caleb drove out there the three sons of Anak:  Sheshai, and Ahiman,

        and Talmai, the children of Anak.

015:015 He went up there against the inhabitants of Debir:

        now the name of Debir before was Kiriath Sepher.

015:016 Caleb said, He who strikes Kiriath Sepher, and takes it,

        to him will I give Achsah my daughter as wife.

015:017 Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, took it:

        and he gave him Achsah his daughter as wife.

015:018 It happened, when she came [to him], that she moved him to ask

        of her father a field:  and she alighted from off her donkey;

        and Caleb said, What would you?

015:019 She said, Give me a blessing; for that you have set me

        in the land of the South, give me also springs of water.

        He gave her the upper springs and the lower springs.

015:020 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Judah

        according to their families.

015:021 The uttermost cities of the tribe of the children of Judah

        toward the border of Edom in the South were Kabzeel,

        and Eder, and Jagur,

015:022 and Kinah, and Dimonah, and Adadah,

        are twenty-nine, with their villages.

015:033 In the lowland, Eshtaol, and Zorah, and Ashnah,

015:034 and Zanoah, and En Gannim, Tappuah, and Enam,

015:035 Jarmuth, and Adullam, Socoh, and Azekah,

015:036 and Shaaraim, and Adithaim, and Gederah, and Gederothaim;

        fourteen cities with their villages.

015:043 and Iphtah, and Ashnah, and Nezib,

015:044 and Keilah, and Achzib, and Mareshah; nine cities

        with their villages.

015:045 Ekron, with its towns and its villages;

015:046 from Ekron even to the sea, all that were by the side of Ashdod,

        with their villages.

015:047 Ashdod, its towns and its villages; Gaza, its towns and

        its villages; to the brook of Egypt, and the great sea,

        and the border [of it].

015:048 In the hill country, Shamir, and Jattir, and Socoh,

015:049 and Dannah, and Kiriath Sannah (the same is Debir),

015:050 and Anab, and Eshtemoh, and Anim,

015:051 and Goshen, and Holon, and Giloh; eleven cities with their villages.

015:052 Arab, and Dumah, and Eshan,

015:053 and Janim, and Beth Tappuah, and Aphekah,

015:054 and Humtah, and Kiriath Arba (the same is Hebron), and Zior;

        nine cities with their villages.

015:058 Halhul, Beth Zur, and Gedor,

015:059 and Maarath, and Beth Anoth, and Eltekon; six cities

        with their villages.

015:060 Kiriath Baal (the same is Kiriath Jearim), and Rabbah;

        two cities with their villages.

015:061 In the wilderness, Beth Arabah, Middin, and Secacah,

015:062 and Nibshan, and the City of Salt, and En Gedi; six cities

        with their villages.

015:063 As for the Jebusites, the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the children

        of Judah couldn't drive them out:  but the Jebusites dwell

        with the children of Judah at Jerusalem to this day.

016:001 The lot came out for the children of Joseph from the Jordan

        at Jericho, at the waters of Jericho on the east,

        even the wilderness, going up from Jericho through the hill

        country to Bethel;

016:002 and it went out from Bethel to Luz, and passed along to the border

        of the Archites to Ataroth;

016:003 and it went down westward to the border of the Japhletites,

        to the border of Beth Horon the lower, even to Gezer;

        and the goings out of it were at the sea.

016:004 The children of Joseph, Manasseh and Ephraim, took their inheritance.

016:005 The border of the children of Ephraim according to their

        families was [thus]: the border of their inheritance eastward

        was Ataroth Addar, to Beth Horon the upper;

016:006 and the border went out westward at Michmethath on the north;

        and the border turned about eastward to Taanath Shiloh,

        and passed along it on the east of Janoah;

016:007 and it went down from Janoah to Ataroth, and to Naarah,

        and reached to Jericho, and went out at the Jordan.

016:008 From Tappuah the border went along westward to the brook

        of Kanah; and the goings out of it were at the sea.

        This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Ephraim

        according to their families;

016:009 together with the cities which were set apart for the children

        of Ephraim in the midst of the inheritance of the children

        of Manasseh, all the cities with their villages.

016:010 They didn't drive out the Canaanites who lived in Gezer:

        but the Canaanites dwell in the midst of Ephraim to this day,

        and are become servants to do forced labor.

017:001 [This] was the lot for the tribe of Manasseh; for he was

        the firstborn of Joseph.  As for Machir the firstborn

        of Manasseh, the father of Gilead, because he was a man of war,

        therefore he had Gilead and Bashan.

017:002 So [the lot] was for the rest of the children of Manasseh

        according to their families:  for the children of Abiezer,

        and for the children of Helek, and for the children of Asriel,

        and for the children of Shechem, and for the children of Hepher,

        and for the children of Shemida:  these were the male children

        of Manasseh the son of Joseph according to their families.

017:003 But Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead,

        the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons,

        but daughters:  and these are the names of his daughters:

        Mahlah, and Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.

017:004 They came near before Eleazar the priest, and before Joshua

        the son of Nun, and before the princes, saying, Yahweh commanded

        Moses to give us an inheritance among our brothers:

        therefore according to the commandment of Yahweh he gave them

        an inheritance among the brothers of their father.

017:005 There fell ten parts to Manasseh, besides the land of Gilead

        and Bashan, which is beyond the Jordan;

017:006 because the daughters of Manasseh had an inheritance among his sons.

        The land of Gilead belonged to the rest of the sons of Manasseh.

017:007 The border of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethath, which is

        before Shechem; and the border went along to the right hand,

        to the inhabitants of En Tappuah.

017:008 The land of Tappuah belonged to Manasseh; but Tappuah on

        the border of Manasseh belonged to the children of Ephraim.

017:009 The border went down to the brook of Kanah, southward of the brook:

        these cities belonged to Ephraim among the cities of Manasseh:

        and the border of Manasseh was on the north side of the brook,

        and the goings out of it were at the sea:

017:010 southward it was Ephraim's, and northward it was Manasseh's,

        and the sea was his border; and they reached to Asher on the north,

        and to Issachar on the east.

017:011 Manasseh had in Issachar and in Asher Beth Shean and its towns,

        and Ibleam and its towns, and the inhabitants of Dor

        and its towns, and the inhabitants of Endor and its towns,

        and the inhabitants of Taanach and its towns, and the inhabitants

        of Megiddo and its towns, even the three heights.

017:012 Yet the children of Manasseh couldn't drive out [the inhabitants

        of] those cities; but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.

017:013 It happened, when the children of Israel had grown strong,

        that they put the Canaanites to forced labor, and didn't

        utterly drive them out.

017:014 The children of Joseph spoke to Joshua, saying, Why have you

        given me but one lot and one part for an inheritance, seeing I

        am a great people, because hitherto Yahweh has blessed me?

017:015 Joshua said to them, If you are a great people, go up to the forest,

        and cut down for yourself there in the land of the Perizzites

        and of the Rephaim; since the hill country of Ephraim is too

        narrow for you.

017:016 The children of Joseph said, The hill country is not enough for us:

        and all the Canaanites who dwell in the land of the valley have

        chariots of iron, both they who are in Beth Shean and its towns,

        and they who are in the valley of Jezreel.

017:017 Joshua spoke to the house of Joseph, even to Ephraim and

        to Manasseh, saying, You are a great people, and have great power;

        you shall not have one lot only:

017:018 but the hill country shall be yours; for though it is a forest,

        you shall cut it down, and the goings out of it shall be yours;

        for you shall drive out the Canaanites, though they have

        chariots of iron, and though they are strong.

018:001 The whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled themselves

        together at Shiloh, and set up the tent of meeting there:

        and the land was subdued before them.

018:002 There remained among the children of Israel seven tribes,

        which had not yet divided their inheritance.

018:003 Joshua said to the children of Israel, How long are you slack to go

        in to possess the land, which Yahweh, the God of your fathers,

        has given you?

018:004 Appoint for you three men of each tribe:  and I will send them,

        and they shall arise, and walk through the land, and describe

        it according to their inheritance; and they shall come to me.

018:005 They shall divide it into seven portions:  Judah shall abide

        in his border on the south, and the house of Joseph shall

        abide in their border on the north.

018:006 You shall describe the land into seven portions, and bring

        [the description] here to me; and I will cast lots for you

        here before Yahweh our God.

018:007 For the Levites have no portion among you; for the priesthood

        of Yahweh is their inheritance:  and Gad and Reuben and

        the half-tribe of Manasseh have received their inheritance

        beyond the Jordan eastward, which Moses the servant of

        Yahweh gave them.

018:008 The men arose, and went:  and Joshua charged those who went

        to describe the land, saying, Go and walk through the land,

        and describe it, and come again to me; and I will cast lots

        for you here before Yahweh in Shiloh.

018:009 The men went and passed through the land, and described it

        by cities into seven portions in a book; and they came

        to Joshua to the camp at Shiloh.

018:010 Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before Yahweh:

        and there Joshua divided the land to the children of Israel

        according to their divisions.

018:011 The lot of the tribe of the children of Benjamin came up

        according to their families:  and the border of their lot went

        out between the children of Judah and the children of Joseph.

018:012 Their border on the north quarter was from the Jordan;

        and the border went up to the side of Jericho on the north,

        and went up through the hill country westward; and the goings

        out of it were at the wilderness of Beth Aven.

018:013 The border passed along from there to Luz, to the side of Luz

        (the same is Bethel), southward; and the border went down

        to Ataroth Addar, by the mountain that lies on the south

        of Beth Horon the lower.

018:014 The border extended [there], and turned about on the west

        quarter southward, from the mountain that lies before

        Beth Horon southward; and the goings out of it were at Kiriath Baal

        (the same is Kiriath Jearim), a city of the children of Judah:

        this was the west quarter.

018:015 The south quarter was from the uttermost part of Kiriath Jearim;

        and the border went out westward, and went out to the spring

        of the waters of Nephtoah;

018:016 and the border went down to the uttermost part of the mountain

        that lies before the valley of the son of Hinnom, which is

        in the valley of Rephaim northward; and it went down to

        the valley of Hinnom, to the side of the Jebusite southward,

        and went down to En Rogel;

018:017 and it extended northward, and went out at En Shemesh, and went

        out to Geliloth, which is over against the ascent of Adummim;

        and it went down to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben;

018:018 and it passed along to the side over against the Arabah northward,

        and went down to the Arabah;

018:019 and the border passed along to the side of Beth Hoglah northward;

        and the goings out of the border were at the north

        bay of the Salt Sea, at the south end of the Jordan:

        this was the south border.

018:020 The Jordan was the border of it on the east quarter.

        This was the inheritance of the children of Benjamin,

        by the borders of it round about, according to their families.

018:021 Now the cities of the tribe of the children of Benjamin

        according to their families were Jericho, and Beth Hoglah,

        and Emek Keziz,

018:022 and Beth Arabah, and Zemaraim, and Bethel,

018:023 and Avvim, and Parah, and Ophrah,

018:024 and Chephar Ammoni, and Ophni, and Geba; twelve cities

        with their villages:

018:025 Gibeon, and Ramah, and Beeroth,

018:026 and Mizpeh, and Chephirah, and Mozah,

018:027 and Rekem, and Irpeel, and Taralah,

018:028 and Zelah, Eleph, and the Jebusite (the same is Jerusalem), Gibeath,

        [and] Kiriath; fourteen cities with their villages.

        This is the inheritance of the children of Benjamin according

        to their families.

019:001 The second lot came out for Simeon, even for the tribe

        of the children of Simeon according to their families:

        and their inheritance was in the midst of the inheritance

        of the children of Judah.

019:002 They had for their inheritance Beersheba, or Sheba, and Moladah,

019:003 and Hazar Shual, and Balah, and Ezem,

019:004 and Eltolad, and Bethul, and Hormah,

019:005 and Ziklag, and Beth Marcaboth, and Hazar Susah,

019:006 and Beth Lebaoth, and Sharuhen; thirteen cities with their villages:

019:008 and all the villages that were round about these cities to

        Baalath Beer, Ramah of the South.  This is the inheritance of

        the tribe of the children of Simeon according to their families.

019:009 Out of the part of the children of Judah was the inheritance

        of the children of Simeon; for the portion of the children

        of Judah was too much for them:  therefore the children

        of Simeon had inheritance in the midst of their inheritance.

019:010 The third lot came up for the children of Zebulun according

        to their families; and the border of their inheritance

        was to Sarid;

019:011 and their border went up westward, even to Maralah, and reached

        to Dabbesheth; and it reached to the brook that is before Jokneam;

019:012 and it turned from Sarid eastward toward the sunrise to

        the border of Chisloth Tabor; and it went out to Daberath,

        and went up to Japhia;

019:013 and from there it passed along eastward to Gath Hepher, to Ethkazin;

        and it went out at Rimmon which stretches to Neah;

019:014 and the border turned about it on the north to Hannathon;

        and the goings out of it were at the valley of Iphtah El;

019:015 and Kattath, and Nahalal, and Shimron, and Idalah, and Bethlehem:

        twelve cities with their villages.

019:016 This is the inheritance of the children of Zebulun according

        to their families, these cities with their villages.

019:017 The fourth lot came out for Issachar, even for the children

        of Issachar according to their families.

019:021 and Remeth, and Engannim, and En Haddah, and Beth Pazzez,

019:022 and the border reached to Tabor, and Shahazumah, and Beth Shemesh;

        and the goings out of their border were at the Jordan:

        sixteen cities with their villages.

019:023 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Issachar

        according to their families, the cities with their villages.

019:024 The fifth lot came out for the tribe of the children of Asher

        according to their families.

019:025 Their border was Helkath, and Hali, and Beten, and Achshaph,

019:026 and Allammelech, and Amad, and Mishal; and it reached to

        Carmel westward, and to Shihorlibnath;

019:027 and it turned toward the sunrise to Beth Dagon, and reached

        to Zebulun, and to the valley of Iphtah El northward to Beth Emek

        and Neiel; and it went out to Cabul on the left hand,

019:028 and Ebron, and Rehob, and Hammon, and Kanah, even to great Sidon;

019:029 and the border turned to Ramah, and to the fortified city of Tyre;

        and the border turned to Hosah; and the goings out of it

        were at the sea by the region of Achzib;

019:030 Ummah also, and Aphek, and Rehob:  twenty-two cities

        with their villages.

019:031 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Asher

        according to their families, these cities with their villages.

019:032 The sixth lot came out for the children of Naphtali, even for

        the children of Naphtali according to their families.

019:033 Their border was from Heleph, from the oak in Zaanannim,

        and Adaminekeb, and Jabneel, to Lakkum; and the goings out

        of it were at the Jordan;

019:034 and the border turned westward to Aznoth Tabor, and went out

        from there to Hukkok; and it reached to Zebulun on the south,

        and reached to Asher on the west, and to Judah at the Jordan

        toward the sunrise.

019:037 and Kedesh, and Edrei, and En Hazor,

019:038 Iron, and Migdal El, Horem, and Beth Anath, and Beth Shemesh;

        nineteen cities with their villages.

019:039 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Naphtali

        according to their families, the cities with their villages.

019:040 The seventh lot came out for the tribe of the children of Dan

        according to their families.

        and took it, and struck it with the edge of the sword,

        and possessed it, and lived therein, and called Leshem, Dan,

        after the name of Dan their father.

019:048 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Dan

        according to their families, these cities with their villages.

019:049 So they made an end of distributing the land for inheritance

        by the borders of it; and the children of Israel gave an

        inheritance to Joshua the son of Nun in the midst of them:

019:050 according to the commandment of Yahweh they gave him the city

        which he asked, even Timnathserah in the hill country of Ephraim;

        and he built the city, and lived therein.

019:051 These are the inheritances, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua

        the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers' [houses] of the tribes

        of the children of Israel, distributed for inheritance by lot

        in Shiloh before Yahweh, at the door of the tent of meeting.

        So they made an end of dividing the land.

020:001 Yahweh spoke to Joshua, saying,

020:002 Speak to the children of Israel, saying, Assign you the cities

        of refuge, of which I spoke to you by Moses,

020:003 that the manslayer who kills any person unwittingly [and]

        unawares may flee there:  and they shall be to you for a refuge

        from the avenger of blood.

020:004 He shall flee to one of those cities, and shall stand at

        the entrance of the gate of the city, and declare his cause

        in the ears of the elders of that city; and they shall

        take him into the city to them, and give him a place,

        that he may dwell among them.

020:005 If the avenger of blood pursue after him, then they shall

        not deliver up the manslayer into his hand; because he struck

        his neighbor unawares, and didn't hate him before.

020:006 He shall dwell in that city, until he stand before the

        congregation for judgment, until the death of the high priest

        that shall be in those days:  then shall the manslayer return,

        and come to his own city, and to his own house, to the city

        from whence he fled.

020:007 They set apart Kedesh in Galilee in the hill country of Naphtali,

        and Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim, and Kiriath Arba

        (the same is Hebron) in the hill country of Judah.

020:008 Beyond the Jordan at Jericho eastward, they assigned Bezer

        in the wilderness in the plain out of the tribe of Reuben,

        and Ramoth in Gilead out of the tribe of Gad, and Golan

        in Bashan out of the tribe of Manasseh.

020:009 These were the appointed cities for all the children

        of Israel, and for the stranger who sojourns among them,

        that whoever kills any person unwittingly might flee there,

        and not die by the hand of the avenger of blood, until he stood

        before the congregation.

021:001 Then came near the heads of fathers' [houses] of the Levites

        to Eleazar the priest, and to Joshua the son of Nun,

        and to the heads of fathers' [houses] of the tribes of

        the children of Israel;

021:002 and they spoke to them at Shiloh in the land of Canaan,

        saying, Yahweh commanded Moses to give us cities to dwell in,

        with the suburbs of it for our livestock.

021:003 The children of Israel gave to the Levites out of their inheritance,

        according to the commandment of Yahweh, these cities

        with their suburbs.

021:004 The lot came out for the families of the Kohathites:

        and the children of Aaron the priest, who were of the Levites,

        had by lot out of the tribe of Judah, and out of the tribe of

        the Simeonites, and out of the tribe of Benjamin, thirteen cities.

021:005 The rest of the children of Kohath had by lot out of the families

        of the tribe of Ephraim, and out of the tribe of Dan,

        and out of the half-tribe of Manasseh, ten cities.

021:006 The children of Gershon had by lot out of the families

        of the tribe of Issachar, and out of the tribe of Asher,

        and out of the tribe of Naphtali, and out of the half-tribe

        of Manasseh in Bashan, thirteen cities.

021:007 The children of Merari according to their families had

        out of the tribe of Reuben, and out of the tribe of Gad,

        and out of the tribe of Zebulun, twelve cities.

021:008 The children of Israel gave by lot to the Levites these cities

        with their suburbs, as Yahweh commanded by Moses.

021:009 They gave out of the tribe of the children of Judah,

        and out of the tribe of the children of Simeon, these cities

        which are [here] mentioned by name:

021:010 and they were for the children of Aaron, of the families

        of the Kohathites, who were of the children of Levi;

        for theirs was the first lot.

021:011 They gave them Kiriath Arba, [which Arba was] the father of Anak

        (the same is Hebron), in the hill country of Judah,

        with the suburbs of it round about it.

021:012 But the fields of the city, and the villages of it, gave they

        to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for his possession.

021:013 To the children of Aaron the priest they gave Hebron

        with its suburbs, the city of refuge for the manslayer,

        and Libnah with its suburbs,

021:014 and Jattir with its suburbs, and Eshtemoa with its suburbs,

021:015 and Holon with its suburbs, and Debir with its suburbs,

021:016 and Ain with its suburbs, and Juttah with its suburbs,

        [and] Beth Shemesh with its suburbs; nine cities out of

        those two tribes.

021:017 Out of the tribe of Benjamin, Gibeon with its suburbs,

        Geba with its suburbs,

021:018 Anathoth with its suburbs, and Almon with its suburbs; four cities.

021:019 All the cities of the children of Aaron, the priests,

        were thirteen cities with their suburbs.

021:020 The families of the children of Kohath, the Levites,

        even the rest of the children of Kohath, they had the cities

        of their lot out of the tribe of Ephraim.

021:021 They gave them Shechem with its suburbs in the hill country

        of Ephraim, the city of refuge for the manslayer, and Gezer

        with its suburbs,

021:022 and Kibzaim with its suburbs, and Beth Horon with its suburbs;

        four cities.

021:023 Out of the tribe of Dan, Elteke with its suburbs,

        Gibbethon with its suburbs,

021:024 Aijalon with its suburbs, Gath Rimmon with its suburbs; four cities.

021:025 Out of the half-tribe of Manasseh, Taanach with its suburbs,

        and Gath Rimmon with its suburbs; two cities.

021:026 All the cities of the families of the rest of the children

        of Kohath were ten with their suburbs.

021:027 To the children of Gershon, of the families of the Levites,

        out of the half-tribe of Manasseh [they gave] Golan in Bashan

        with its suburbs, the city of refuge for the manslayer,

        and Be Eshterah with its suburbs; two cities.

021:028 Out of the tribe of Issachar, Kishion with its suburbs,

        Daberath with its suburbs,

021:029 Jarmuth with its suburbs, En Gannim with its suburbs; four cities.

021:030 Out of the tribe of Asher, Mishal with its suburbs,

        Abdon with its suburbs,

021:031 Helkath with its suburbs, and Rehob with its suburbs; four cities.

021:032 Out of the tribe of Naphtali, Kedesh in Galilee with its suburbs,

        the city of refuge for the manslayer, and Hammothdor with

        its suburbs, and Kartan with its suburbs; three cities.

021:033 All the cities of the Gershonites according to their families

        were thirteen cities with their suburbs.

021:034 To the families of the children of Merari, the rest of the Levites,

        out of the tribe of Zebulun, Jokneam with its suburbs,

        and Kartah with its suburbs,

021:035 Dimnah with its suburbs, Nahalal with its suburbs; four cities.

021:036 Out of the tribe of Reuben, Bezer with its suburbs, and Jahaz

        with its suburbs,

021:037 Kedemoth with its suburbs, and Mephaath with its suburbs;

        four cities.

021:038 Out of the tribe of Gad, Ramoth in Gilead with its suburbs,

        the city of refuge for the manslayer, and Mahanaim with its suburbs,

021:039 Heshbon with its suburbs, Jazer with its suburbs;

        four cities in all.

021:040 All [these were] the cities of the children of Merari according

        to their families, even the rest of the families of the Levites;

        and their lot was twelve cities.

021:041 All the cities of the Levites in the midst of the possession

        of the children of Israel were forty-eight cities

        with their suburbs.

021:042 These cities were every one with their suburbs round about them:

        thus it was with all these cities.

021:043 So Yahweh gave to Israel all the land which he swore to give

        to their fathers; and they possessed it, and lived therein.

021:044 Yahweh gave them rest round about, according to all that he swore

        to their fathers:  and there stood not a man of all their

        enemies before them; Yahweh delivered all their enemies

        into their hand.

021:045 There failed not anything of any good thing which Yahweh had

        spoken to the house of Israel; all came to pass.

022:001 Then Joshua called the Reubenites, and the Gadites,

        and the half-tribe of Manasseh,

022:002 and said to them, You have kept all that Moses the servant

        of Yahweh commanded you, and have listened to my voice in all

        that I commanded you:

022:003 you have not left your brothers these many days to this day,

        but have kept the charge of the commandment of Yahweh your God.

022:004 Now Yahweh your God has given rest to your brothers, as he spoke

        to them:  therefore now turn you, and get you to your tents,

        to the land of your possession, which Moses the servant

        of Yahweh gave you beyond the Jordan.

022:005 Only take diligent heed to do the commandment and the law which Moses

        the servant of Yahweh commanded you, to love Yahweh your God,

        and to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments,

        and to cleave to him, and to serve him with all your heart

        and with all your soul.

022:006 So Joshua blessed them, and sent them away; and they went

        to their tents.

022:007 Now to the one half-tribe of Manasseh Moses had given

        [inheritance] in Bashan; but to the other half gave

        Joshua among their brothers beyond the Jordan westward;

        moreover when Joshua sent them away to their tents,

        he blessed them,

022:008 and spoke to them, saying, Return with much wealth to your tents,

        and with very much livestock, with silver, and with gold,

        and with brass, and with iron, and with very much clothing:

        divide the spoil of your enemies with your brothers.

022:009 The children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the half-tribe

        of Manasseh returned, and departed from the children of Israel

        out of Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan, to go to the land

        of Gilead, to the land of their possession, which they owned,

        according to the commandment of Yahweh by Moses.

022:010 When they came to the region about the Jordan, that is in the land

        of Canaan, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and

        the half-tribe of Manasseh built there an altar by the Jordan,

        a great altar to look on.

022:011 The children of Israel heard say, Behold, the children of Reuben

        and the children of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh

        have built an altar in the forefront of the land of Canaan,

        in the region about the Jordan, on the side that pertains

        to the children of Israel.

022:012 When the children of Israel heard of it, the whole congregation

        of the children of Israel gathered themselves together at Shiloh,

        to go up against them to war.

022:013 The children of Israel sent to the children of Reuben,

        and to the children of Gad, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh,

        into the land of Gilead, Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest,

022:014 and with him ten princes, one prince of a fathers' house for

        each of the tribes of Israel; and they were everyone of them

        head of their fathers' houses among the thousands of Israel.

022:015 They came to the children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad,

        and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, to the land of Gilead,

        and they spoke with them, saying,

022:016 Thus says the whole congregation of Yahweh, What trespass

        is this that you have committed against the God of Israel,

        to turn away this day from following Yahweh, in that you

        have built you an altar, to rebel this day against Yahweh?

022:017 Is the iniquity of Peor too little for us, from which we

        have not cleansed ourselves to this day, although there came

        a plague on the congregation of Yahweh,

022:018 that you must turn away this day from following Yahweh? and it

        will be, seeing you rebel today against Yahweh, that tomorrow

        he will be angry with the whole congregation of Israel.

022:019 However, if the land of your possession be unclean,

        then pass over to the land of the possession of Yahweh,

        in which Yahweh's tent dwells, and take possession among us:

        but don't rebel against Yahweh, nor rebel against us,

        in building you an altar besides the altar of Yahweh our God.

022:020 Didn't Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the devoted thing,

        and wrath fell on all the congregation of Israel? and that man

        didn't perish alone in his iniquity.

022:021 Then the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and

        the half-tribe of Manasseh answered, and spoke to the heads

        of the thousands of Israel,

022:022 The Mighty One, God, Yahweh, the Mighty One, God, Yahweh, he knows;

        and Israel he shall know:  if it be in rebellion, or if in

        trespass against Yahweh (don't save us this day),

022:023 that we have built us an altar to turn away from following Yahweh;

        or if to offer thereon burnt offering or meal offering,

        or if to offer sacrifices of peace offerings thereon,

        let Yahweh himself require it;

022:024 and if we have not [rather] out of carefulness done this,

        [and] of purpose, saying, In time to come your children might

        speak to our children, saying, What have you to do with Yahweh,

        the God of Israel?

022:025 for Yahweh has made the Jordan a border between us and you,

        you children of Reuben and children of Gad; you have no portion

        in Yahweh:  so might your children make our children cease

        from fearing Yahweh.

022:026 Therefore we said, Let us now prepare to build us an altar,

        not for burnt offering, nor for sacrifice:

022:027 but it shall be a witness between us and you, and between our

        generations after us, that we may do the service of Yahweh

        before him with our burnt offerings, and with our sacrifices,

        and with our peace offerings; that your children may not tell

        our children in time to come, You have no portion in Yahweh.

022:028 Therefore said we, It shall be, when they so tell us

        or to our generations in time to come, that we shall say,

        Behold the pattern of the altar of Yahweh, which our

        fathers made, not for burnt offering, nor for sacrifice;

        but it is a witness between us and you.

022:029 Far be it from us that we should rebel against Yahweh,

        and turn away this day from following Yahweh, to build an altar

        for burnt offering, for meal offering, or for sacrifice,

        besides the altar of Yahweh our God that is before his tent.

022:030 When Phinehas the priest, and the princes of the congregation,

        even the heads of the thousands of Israel that were with him,

        heard the words that the children of Reuben and the children

        of Gad and the children of Manasseh spoke, it pleased them well.

022:031 Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said to the children

        of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the children

        of Manasseh, This day we know that Yahweh is in the midst of us,

        because you have not committed this trespass against Yahweh:

        now have you delivered the children of Israel out of the

        hand of Yahweh.

022:032 Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, and the princes,

        returned from the children of Reuben, and from the children

        of Gad, out of the land of Gilead, to the land of Canaan,

        to the children of Israel, and brought them word again.

022:033 The thing pleased the children of Israel; and the children of

        Israel blessed God, and spoke no more of going up against them

        to war, to destroy the land in which the children of Reuben

        and the children of Gad lived.

022:034 The children of Reuben and the children of Gad called

        the altar [Ed]: For, [said they], it is a witness between us

        that Yahweh is God.

023:001 It happened after many days, when Yahweh had given rest

        to Israel from all their enemies round about, and Joshua

        was old and well stricken in years;

023:002 that Joshua called for all Israel, for their elders and for

        their heads, and for their judges and for their officers,

        and said to them, I am old and well stricken in years:

023:003 and you have seen all that Yahweh your God has done to all

        these nations because of you; for Yahweh your God, he it

        is that has fought for you.

023:004 Behold, I have allotted to you these nations that remain,

        to be an inheritance for your tribes, from the Jordan,

        with all the nations that I have cut off, even to the great

        sea toward the going down of the sun.

023:005 Yahweh your God, he will thrust them out from before you,

        and drive them from out of your sight; and you shall possess

        their land, as Yahweh your God spoke to you.

023:006 Therefore be you very courageous to keep and to do all that is

        written in the book of the law of Moses, that you not turn

        aside from it to the right hand or to the left;

023:007 that you not come among these nations, these that remain

        among you; neither make mention of the name of their gods,

        nor cause to swear [by them], neither serve them, nor bow

        down yourselves to them;

023:008 but cleave to Yahweh your God, as you have done to this day.

023:009 For Yahweh has driven out from before you great nations and strong:

        but as for you, no man has stood before you to this day.

023:010 One man of you shall chase a thousand; for Yahweh your God,

        he it is who fights for you, as he spoke to you.

023:011 Take good heed therefore to yourselves, that you love

        Yahweh your God.

023:012 Else if you do at all go back, and cleave to the remnant

        of these nations, even these who remain among you, and make

        marriages with them, and go in to them, and they to you;

023:013 know for a certainty that Yahweh your God will no more drive

        these nations from out of your sight; but they shall be

        a snare and a trap to you, and a scourge in your sides,

        and thorns in your eyes, until you perish from off this

        good land which Yahweh your God has given you.

023:014 Behold, this day I am going the way of all the earth:

        and you know in all your hearts and in all your souls,

        that not one thing has failed of all the good things which

        Yahweh your God spoke concerning you; all are happen to you,

        not one thing has failed of it.

023:015 It shall happen, that as all the good things are come on you

        of which Yahweh your God spoke to you, so will Yahweh bring

        on you all the evil things, until he have destroyed you from

        off this good land which Yahweh your God has given you.

023:016 When you disobey the covenant of Yahweh your God,

        which he commanded you, and go and serve other gods,

        and bow down yourselves to them; then will the anger of Yahweh

        be kindled against you, and you shall perish quickly from off

        the good land which he has given to you.

024:001 Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem,

        and called for the elders of Israel, and for their heads,

        and for their judges, and for their officers; and they

        presented themselves before God.

024:002 Joshua said to all the people, Thus says Yahweh, the God

        of Israel, Your fathers lived of old time beyond the River,

        even Terah, the father of Abraham, and the father of Nahor:

        and they served other gods.

024:003 I took your father Abraham from beyond the River, and led him

        throughout all the land of Canaan, and multiplied his seed,

        and gave him Isaac.

024:004 I gave to Isaac Jacob and Esau:  and I gave to Esau Mount Seir,

        to possess it:  and Jacob and his children went down into Egypt.

024:005 I sent Moses and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt, according to

        that which I did in the midst of it:  and afterward I

        brought you out.

024:006 I brought your fathers out of Egypt:  and you came to the sea;

        and the Egyptians pursued after your fathers with chariots

        and with horsemen to the Red Sea{or, Sea of Reeds}.

024:007 When they cried out to Yahweh, he put darkness between

        you and the Egyptians, and brought the sea on them,

        and covered them; and your eyes saw what I did in Egypt:

        and you lived in the wilderness many days.

024:008 I brought you into the land of the Amorites, that lived beyond

        the Jordan:  and they fought with you; and I gave them into

        your hand, and you possessed their land; and I destroyed them

        from before you.

024:009 Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and fought

        against Israel:  and he sent and called Balaam the son of Beor

        to curse you;

024:010 but I would not listen to Balaam; therefore he blessed you still:

        so I delivered you out of his hand.

024:011 You went over the Jordan, and came to Jericho:  and the men

        of Jericho fought against you, the Amorite, and the Perizzite,

        and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Girgashite, the Hivite,

        and the Jebusite; and I delivered them into your hand.

024:012 I sent the hornet before you, which drove them out from before you,

        even the two kings of the Amorites; not with your sword,

        nor with your bow.

024:013 I gave you a land whereon you had not labored, and cities

        which you didn't build, and you dwell therein; of vineyards

        and olive groves which you didn't plant do you eat.

024:014 Now therefore fear Yahweh, and serve him in sincerity and in truth;

        and put away the gods which your fathers served beyond the River,

        and in Egypt; and serve you Yahweh.

024:015 If it seem evil to you to serve Yahweh, choose you this day whom

        you will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served

        that were beyond the River, or the gods of the Amorites,

        in whose land you dwell:  but as for me and my house,

        we will serve Yahweh.

024:016 The people answered, Far be it from us that we should forsake Yahweh,

        to serve other gods;

024:017 for Yahweh our God, he it is who brought us and our fathers

        up out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage,

        and who did those great signs in our sight, and preserved us

        in all the way in which we went, and among all the peoples

        through the midst of whom we passed;

024:018 and Yahweh drove out from before us all the peoples, even the Amorites

        who lived in the land:  therefore we also will serve Yahweh;

        for he is our God.

024:019 Joshua said to the people, You can't serve Yahweh;

        for he is a holy God; he is a jealous God; he will not forgive

        your disobedience nor your sins.

024:020 If you forsake Yahweh, and serve foreign gods, then he will

        turn and do you evil, and consume you, after that he has

        done you good.

024:021 The people said to Joshua, No; but we will serve Yahweh.

024:022 Joshua said to the people, You are witnesses against

        yourselves that you have chosen you Yahweh, to serve him.

        They said, We are witnesses.

024:023 Now therefore put away, [said he], the foreign gods which are

        among you, and incline your heart to Yahweh, the God of Israel.

024:024 The people said to Joshua, Yahweh our God will we serve,

        and to his voice will we listen.

024:025 So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and set

        them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem.

024:026 Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God;

        and he took a great stone, and set it up there under the oak

        that was by the sanctuary of Yahweh.

024:027 Joshua said to all the people, Behold, this stone shall be

        a witness against us; for it has heard all the words of Yahweh

        which he spoke to us:  it shall be therefore a witness against you,

        lest you deny your God.

024:028 So Joshua sent the people away, every man to his inheritance.

024:029 It happened after these things, that Joshua the son of Nun,

        the servant of Yahweh, died, being one hundred ten years old.

024:030 They buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnathserah,

        which is in the hill country of Ephraim, on the north

        of the mountain of Gaash.

024:031 Israel served Yahweh all the days of Joshua, and all the days

        of the elders who outlived Joshua, and had known all the work

        of Yahweh, that he had worked for Israel.

024:032 The bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought

        up out of Egypt, buried they in Shechem, in the parcel

        of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor

        the father of Shechem for a hundred pieces of money:

        and they became the inheritance of the children of Joseph.

024:033 Eleazar the son of Aaron died; and they buried him in the hill

        of Phinehas his son, which was given him in the hill

        country of Ephraim.

Book 07 Judges

001:001 It happened after the death of Joshua, the children of Israel

        asked of Yahweh, saying, Who shall go up for us first against

        the Canaanites, to fight against them?

001:002 Yahweh said, Judah shall go up:  behold, I have delivered

        the land into his hand.

001:003 Judah said to Simeon his brother, Come up with me into my lot,

        that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I likewise

        will go with you into your lot.  So Simeon went with him.

001:004 Judah went up; and Yahweh delivered the Canaanites and the

        Perizzites into their hand:  and they struck of them in Bezek

        ten thousand men.

001:005 They found Adoni-Bezek in Bezek; and they fought against him,

        and they struck the Canaanites and the Perizzites.

001:006 But Adoni-Bezek fled; and they pursued after him, and caught him,

        and cut off his thumbs and his great toes.

001:007 Adoni-Bezek said, "Seventy kings, having their thumbs and their

        great toes cut off, gathered [their food] under my table:

        as I have done, so God has requited me."  They brought him

        to Jerusalem, and he died there.

001:008 The children of Judah fought against Jerusalem, and took it,

        and struck it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire.

001:009 Afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against

        the Canaanites who lived in the hill country, and in the South,

        and in the lowland.

001:010 Judah went against the Canaanites who lived in Hebron

        (now the name of Hebron before was Kiriath Arba); and they

        struck Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai.

001:011 From there he went against the inhabitants of Debir.

        (Now the name of Debir before was Kiriath Sepher.)

001:012 Caleb said, He who strikes Kiriath Sepher, and takes it,

        to him will I give Achsah my daughter as wife.

001:013 Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, took it:

        and he gave him Achsah his daughter as wife.

001:014 It happened, when she came [to him], that she moved him to ask

        of her father a field:  and she alighted from off her donkey;

        and Caleb said to her, What would you?

001:015 She said to him, Give me a blessing; for that you have set me

        in the land of the South, give me also springs of water.

        Caleb gave her the upper springs and the lower springs.

001:016 The children of the Kenite, Moses' brother-in-law, went up

        out of the city of palm trees with the children of Judah

        into the wilderness of Judah, which is in the south of Arad;

        and they went and lived with the people.

001:017 Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they struck the

        Canaanites who inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it.

        The name of the city was called Hormah.

001:018 Also Judah took Gaza with the border of it, and Ashkelon

        with the border of it, and Ekron with the border of it.

001:019 Yahweh was with Judah; and drove out [the inhabitants of]

        the hill country; for he could not drive out the inhabitants

        of the valley, because they had chariots of iron.

001:020 They gave Hebron to Caleb, as Moses had spoken:

        and he drove out there the three sons of Anak.

001:021 The children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites who

        inhabited Jerusalem; but the Jebusites dwell with the children

        of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this day.

001:022 The house of Joseph, they also went up against Bethel;

        and Yahweh was with them.

001:023 The house of Joseph sent to spy out Bethel.  (Now the name

        of the city before was Luz.)

001:024 The watchers saw a man come forth out of the city, and they

        said to him, Show us, we pray you, the entrance into the city,

        and we will deal kindly with you.

001:025 He shown them the entrance into the city; and they struck

        the city with the edge of the sword; but they let the man go

        and all his family.

001:026 The man went into the land of the Hittites, and built a city,

        and called the name of it Luz, which is the name of it

        to this day.

001:027 Manasseh did not drive out [the inhabitants of] Beth Shean and

        its towns, nor [of] Taanach and its towns, nor the inhabitants

        of Dor and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and

        its towns, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns;

        but the Canaanites would dwell in that land.

001:028 It happened, when Israel had grown strong, that they put

        the Canaanites to forced labor, and did not utterly

        drive them out.

001:029 Ephraim didn't drive out the Canaanites who lived in Gezer;

        but the Canaanites lived in Gezer among them.

001:030 Zebulun didn't drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, nor the

        inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites lived among them,

        and became subject to forced labor.

001:031 Asher didn't drive out the inhabitants of Acco, nor the inhabitants

        of Sidon, nor of Ahlab, nor of Achzib, nor of Helbah,

        nor of Aphik, nor of Rehob;

001:032 but the Asherites lived among the Canaanites, the inhabitants

        of the land; for they did not drive them out.

001:033 Naphtali didn't drive out the inhabitants of Beth Shemesh,

        nor the inhabitants of Beth Anath; but he lived

        among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land:

        nevertheless the inhabitants of Beth Shemesh and of Beth Anath

        became subject to forced labor.

001:034 The Amorites forced the children of Dan into the hill country;

        for they would not allow them to come down to the valley;

001:035 but the Amorites would dwell in Mount Heres, in Aijalon,

        and in Shaalbim:  yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed,

        so that they became subject to forced labor.

001:036 The border of the Amorites was from the ascent of Akrabbim,

        from the rock, and upward.

002:001 The angel of Yahweh came up from Gilgal to Bochim.

        He said, I made you to go up out of Egypt, and have brought

        you to the land which I swore to your fathers; and I said,

        I will never break my covenant with you:

002:002 and you shall make no covenant with the inhabitants of this land;

        you shall break down their altars.  But you have not listened

        to my voice:  why have you done this?

002:003 Therefore I also said, I will not drive them out from before you;

        but they shall be [as thorns] in your sides, and their gods

        shall be a snare to you.

002:004 It happened, when the angel of Yahweh spoke these words

        to all the children of Israel, that the people lifted up

        their voice, and wept.

002:005 They called the name of that place Bochim:  and they sacrificed

        there to Yahweh.

002:006 Now when Joshua had sent the people away, the children of Israel

        went every man to his inheritance to possess the land.

002:007 The people served Yahweh all the days of Joshua, and all

        the days of the elders who outlived Joshua, who had seen

        all the great work of Yahweh that he had worked for Israel.

002:008 Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Yahweh, died, being one

        hundred ten years old.

002:009 They buried him in the border of his inheritance in

        Timnath Heres, in the hill country of Ephraim, on the north

        of the mountain of Gaash.

002:010 Also all that generation were gathered to their fathers:

        and there arose another generation after them, who didn't

        know Yahweh, nor yet the work which he had worked for Israel.

002:011 The children of Israel did that which was evil in the sight

        of Yahweh, and served the Baals;

002:012 and they forsook Yahweh, the God of their fathers, who brought

        them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods,

        of the gods of the peoples who were round about them, and bowed

        themselves down to them:  and they provoked Yahweh to anger.

002:013 They forsook Yahweh, and served Baal and the Ashtaroth.

002:014 The anger of Yahweh was kindled against Israel, and he delivered

        them into the hands of spoilers who despoiled them;

        and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about,

        so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies.

002:015 Wherever they went out, the hand of Yahweh was against them

        for evil, as Yahweh had spoken, and as Yahweh had sworn to them:

        and they were sore distressed.

002:016 Yahweh raised up judges, who saved them out of the hand

        of those who despoiled them.

002:017 Yet they didn't listen to their judges; for they played the

        prostitute after other gods, and bowed themselves down to them:

        they turned aside quickly out of the way in which their

        fathers walked, obeying the commandments of Yahweh;

        [but] they didn't do so.

002:018 When Yahweh raised them up judges, then Yahweh was with the judge,

        and saved them out of the hand of their enemies all the days

        of the judge:  for it grieved Yahweh because of their groaning

        by reason of those who oppressed them and vexed them.

002:019 But it happened, when the judge was dead, that they turned back,

        and dealt more corruptly than their fathers, in following

        other gods to serve them, and to bow down to them; they didn't

        cease from their doings, nor from their stubborn way.

002:020 The anger of Yahweh was kindled against Israel; and he said,

        Because this nation have transgressed my covenant which I

        commanded their fathers, and have not listened to my voice;

002:021 I also will not henceforth drive out any from before them

        of the nations that Joshua left when he died;

002:022 that by them I may prove Israel, whether they will keep

        the way of Yahweh to walk therein, as their fathers did

        keep it, or not.

002:023 So Yahweh left those nations, without driving them out hastily;

        neither delivered he them into the hand of Joshua.

003:001 Now these are the nations which Yahweh left, to prove Israel

        by them, even as many [of Israel] as had not known all

        the wars of Canaan;

003:002 only that the generations of the children of Israel might know,

        to teach them war, at the least such as before knew nothing of it:

003:003 [namely], the five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites,

        and the Sidonians, and the Hivites who lived on Mount Lebanon,

        from Mount Baal Hermon to the entrance of Hamath.

003:004 They were [left], to prove Israel by them, to know whether they

        would listen to the commandments of Yahweh, which he commanded

        their fathers by Moses.

003:005 The children of Israel lived among the Canaanites, the Hittites,

        and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites,

        and the Jebusites:

003:006 and they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave

        their own daughters to their sons and served their gods.

003:007 The children of Israel did that which was evil in the sight

        of Yahweh, and forgot Yahweh their God, and served the Baals

        and the Asheroth.

003:008 Therefore the anger of Yahweh was kindled against Israel, and he sold

        them into the hand of Cushan Rishathaim king of Mesopotamia:

        and the children of Israel served Cushan Rishathaim eight years.

003:009 When the children of Israel cried to Yahweh, Yahweh raised

        up a savior to the children of Israel, who saved them,

        even Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother.

003:010 The Spirit of Yahweh came on him, and he judged Israel;

        and he went out to war, and Yahweh delivered Cushan Rishathaim

        king of Mesopotamia into his hand:  and his hand prevailed

        against Cushan Rishathaim.

003:011 The land had rest forty years.  Othniel the son of Kenaz died.

003:012 The children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight

        of Yahweh:  and Yahweh strengthened Eglon the king of Moab

        against Israel, because they had done that which was evil

        in the sight of Yahweh.

003:013 He gathered to him the children of Ammon and Amalek;

        and he went and struck Israel, and they possessed the city

        of palm trees.

003:014 The children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.

003:015 But when the children of Israel cried to Yahweh, Yahweh raised

        them up a savior, Ehud the son of Gera, the Benjamite,

        a man left-handed. The children of Israel sent tribute by him

        to Eglon the king of Moab.

003:016 Ehud made him a sword which had two edges, a cubit in length;

        and he girded it under his clothing on his right thigh.

003:017 He offered the tribute to Eglon king of Moab:  now Eglon was

        a very fat man.

003:018 When he had made an end of offering the tribute, he sent away

        the people who bore the tribute.

003:019 But he himself turned back from the quarries that were by Gilgal,

        and said, I have a secret errand to you, king.  He said,

        Keep silence.  All who stood by him went out from him.

003:020 Ehud came to him; and he was sitting by himself alone in the cool

        upper room.  Ehud said, I have a message from God to you.

        He arose out of his seat.

003:021 Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the sword from his

        right thigh, and thrust it into his body:

003:022 and the haft also went in after the blade; and the fat closed

        on the blade, for he didn't draw the sword out of his body;

        and it came out behind.

003:023 Then Ehud went forth into the porch, and shut the doors

        of the upper room on him, and locked them.

003:024 Now when he was gone out, his servants came; and they saw,

        and behold, the doors of the upper room were locked; and they said,

        Surely he is covering his feet in the upper chamber.

003:025 They waited until they were ashamed; and behold, he didn't open

        the doors of the upper room:  therefore they took the key,

        and opened [them], and behold, their lord was fallen down dead

        on the earth.

003:026 Ehud escaped while they waited, and passed beyond the quarries,

        and escaped to Seirah.

003:027 It happened, when he had come, that he blew a trumpet in

        the hill country of Ephraim; and the children of Israel went

        down with him from the hill country, and he before them.

003:028 He said to them, Follow after me; for Yahweh has delivered your

        enemies the Moabites into your hand.  They went down after him,

        and took the fords of the Jordan against the Moabites,

        and didn't allow a man to pass over.

003:029 They struck of Moab at that time about ten thousand men,

        every lusty man, and every man of valor; and there escaped

        not a man.

003:030 So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel.

        The land had rest eighty years.

003:031 After him was Shamgar the son of Anath, who struck

        of the Philistines six hundred men with an oxgoad:

        and he also saved Israel.

004:001 The children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight

        of Yahweh, when Ehud was dead.

004:002 Yahweh sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan,

        who reigned in Hazor; the captain of whose army was Sisera,

        who lived in Harosheth of the Gentiles.

004:003 The children of Israel cried to Yahweh:  for he had nine hundred

        chariots of iron; and twenty years he mightily oppressed

        the children of Israel.

004:004 Now Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lappidoth, she judged

        Israel at that time.

004:005 She lived under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel

        in the hill country of Ephraim:  and the children of Israel

        came up to her for judgment.

004:006 She sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of

        Kedesh Naphtali, and said to him, Hasn't Yahweh, the God

        of Israel, commanded, [saying], Go and draw to Mount Tabor,

        and take with you ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali

        and of the children of Zebulun?

004:007 I will draw to you, to the river Kishon, Sisera, the captain

        of Jabin's army, with his chariots and his multitude;

        and I will deliver him into your hand.

004:008 Barak said to her, If you will go with me, then I will go;

        but if you will not go with me, I will not go.

004:009 She said, I will surely go with you:  notwithstanding, the journey

        that you take shall not be for your honor; for Yahweh

        will sell Sisera into the hand of a woman.  Deborah arose,

        and went with Barak to Kedesh.

004:010 Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali together to Kedesh;

        and there went up ten thousand men at his feet:

        and Deborah went up with him.

004:011 Now Heber the Kenite had separated himself from the Kenites,

        even from the children of Hobab the brother-in-law of Moses,

        and had pitched his tent as far as the oak in Zaanannim,

        which is by Kedesh.

004:012 They told Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone up

        to Mount Tabor.

004:013 Sisera gathered together all his chariots, even nine hundred

        chariots of iron, and all the people who were with him,

        from Harosheth of the Gentiles, to the river Kishon.

004:014 Deborah said to Barak, Up; for this is the day in which Yahweh has

        delivered Sisera into your hand; hasn't Yahweh gone out before you?

        So Barak went down from Mount Tabor, and ten thousand

        men after him.

004:015 Yahweh confused Sisera, and all his chariots, and all his army,

        with the edge of the sword before Barak; and Sisera alighted

        from his chariot, and fled away on his feet.

004:016 But Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the army,

        to Harosheth of the Gentiles:  and all the army of Sisera

        fell by the edge of the sword; there was not a man left.

004:017 However Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael

        the wife of Heber the Kenite; for there was peace between Jabin

        the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.

004:018 Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said to him, Turn in, my lord,

        turn in to me; don't be afraid.  He came in to her into the tent,

        and she covered him with a rug.

004:019 He said to her, Please give me a little water to drink;

        for I am thirsty.  She opened a bottle of milk, and gave

        him drink, and covered him.

004:020 He said to her, Stand in the door of the tent, and it shall be,

        when any man does come and inquire of you, and say, Is there

        any man here? that you shall say, No.

004:021 Then Jael Heber's wife took a tent peg, and took a hammer

        in her hand, and went softly to him, and struck the pin

        into his temples, and it pierced through into the ground;

        for he was in a deep sleep; so he swooned and died.

004:022 Behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him,

        and said to him, Come, and I will show you the man whom you seek.

        He came to her; and behold, Sisera lay dead, and the tent

        peg was in his temples.

004:023 So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before

        the children of Israel.

004:024 The hand of the children of Israel prevailed more and more

        against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had destroyed

        Jabin king of Canaan.

005:001 Then Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam sang on that day, saying,

005:002 Because the leaders took the lead in Israel, because the people

        offered themselves willingly, be blessed, Yahweh!

005:003 Hear, you kings!  Give ear, you princes!  I, [even] I,

        will sing to Yahweh.  I will sing praise to Yahweh,

        the God of Israel.

005:004 Yahweh, when you went forth out of Seir, when you marched out

        of the field of Edom, the earth trembled, the sky also dropped.

        Yes, the clouds dropped water.

005:005 The mountains quaked at the presence of Yahweh, even Sinai,

        at the presence of Yahweh, the God of Israel.

005:006 In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, in the days of Jael,

        the highways were unoccupied.  The travelers walked through byways.

005:007 The rulers ceased in Israel.  They ceased until I, Deborah, arose;

        Until I arose a mother in Israel.

005:008 They chose new gods.  Then war was in the gates.  Was there

        a shield or spear seen among forty thousand in Israel?

005:009 My heart is toward the governors of Israel, who offered

        themselves willingly among the people.  Bless Yahweh!

005:010 Tell [of it], you who ride on white donkeys, you who sit

        on rich carpets, and you who walk by the way.

005:011 Far from the noise of archers, in the places of drawing

        water, there they will rehearse the righteous acts

        of Yahweh, [Even] the righteous acts of his rule in Israel.

        Then the people of Yahweh went down to the gates.

005:012 Awake, awake, Deborah!  Awake, awake, utter a song!

        Arise, Barak, and lead away your captives, you son of Abinoam.

005:013 Then a remnant of the nobles [and] the people came down.

        Yahweh came down for me against the mighty.

005:014 Those whose root is in Amalek came out of Ephraim, after you,

        Benjamin, among your peoples.  Governors come down out of Machir.

        Those who handle the marshal's staff came out of Zebulun.

005:015 The princes of Issachar were with Deborah.  As was Issachar,

        so was Barak.  They rushed into the valley at his feet.

        By the watercourses of Reuben, there were great resolves of heart.

005:016 Why did you sit among the sheepfolds, To hear the whistling

        for the flocks?  At the watercourses of Reuben There were

        great searchings of heart.

005:017 Gilead lived beyond the Jordan.  Why did Dan remain in ships?

        Asher sat still at the haven of the sea, and lived by his creeks.

005:018 Zebulun was a people that jeopardized their lives to the deaths;

        Naphtali also, on the high places of the field.

005:019 The kings came and fought, then the kings of Canaan fought at

        Taanach by the waters of Megiddo.  They took no plunder of silver.

005:020 From the sky the stars fought.  From their courses,

        they fought against Sisera.

005:021 The river Kishon swept them away, that ancient river,

        the river Kishon.  My soul, march on with strength.

005:022 Then the horse hoofs stamped because of the prancings,

        the prancings of their strong ones.

005:023 Curse Meroz, said the angel of Yahweh.  Curse bitterly

        its inhabitants, because they didn't come to help Yahweh,

        to help Yahweh against the mighty.

005:024 Jael shall be blessed above women, the wife of Heber the Kenite;

        blessed shall she be above women in the tent.

005:025 He asked for water.  She gave him milk.  She brought him butter

        in a lordly dish.

005:026 She put her hand to the tent peg, and her right hand to

        the workmen's hammer.  With the hammer she struck Sisera.

        She struck through his head.  Yes, she pierced and struck

        through his temples.

005:027 At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay.  At her feet he bowed,

        he fell.  Where he bowed, there he fell down dead.

005:028 Through the window she looked out, and cried:  Sisera's mother

        looked through the lattice.  Why is his chariot so long in coming?

        Why do the wheels of his chariots wait?

005:029 Her wise ladies answered her, Yes, she returned answer to herself,

005:030 Have they not found, have they not divided the spoil?  A lady,

        two ladies to every man; to Sisera a spoil of dyed garments,

        A spoil of dyed garments embroidered, Of dyed garments

        embroidered on both sides, on the necks of the spoil?

005:031 So let all your enemies perish, Yahweh, but let those who love

        him be as the sun when it rises forth in its strength.

        The land had rest forty years.

006:001 The children of Israel did that which was evil in the sight

        of Yahweh:  and Yahweh delivered them into the hand of

        Midian seven years.

006:002 The hand of Midian prevailed against Israel; and because of

        Midian the children of Israel made them the dens which are

        in the mountains, and the caves, and the strongholds.

006:003 So it was, when Israel had sown, that the Midianites came up,

        and the Amalekites, and the children of the east; they came

        up against them;

006:004 and they encamped against them, and destroyed the increase

        of the earth, until you come to Gaza, and left no sustenance

        in Israel, neither sheep, nor ox, nor donkey.

006:005 For they came up with their livestock and their tents;

        they came in as locusts for multitude; both they and their

        camels were without number:  and they came into the land

        to destroy it.

006:006 Israel was brought very low because of Midian; and the children

        of Israel cried to Yahweh.

006:007 It happened, when the children of Israel cried to Yahweh

        because of Midian,

006:008 that Yahweh sent a prophet to the children of Israel:

        and he said to them, Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, I

        brought you up from Egypt, and brought you forth out of

        the house of bondage;

006:009 and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians,

        and out of the hand of all who oppressed you, and drove them

        out from before you, and gave you their land;

006:010 and I said to you, I am Yahweh your God; you shall not

        fear the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you dwell.

        But you have not listened to my voice.

006:011 The angel of Yahweh came, and sat under the oak which

        was in Ophrah, that pertained to Joash the Abiezrite:

        and his son Gideon was beating out wheat in the winepress,

        to hide it from the Midianites.

006:012 The angel of Yahweh appeared to him, and said to him,

        Yahweh is with you, you mighty man of valor.

006:013 Gideon said to him, Oh, my lord, if Yahweh is with us, why then

        has all this happened to us? and where are all his wondrous

        works which our fathers told us of, saying, Did not Yahweh

        bring us up from Egypt? but now Yahweh has cast us off,

        and delivered us into the hand of Midian.

006:014 Yahweh looked at him, and said, Go in this your might,

        and save Israel from the hand of Midian:  have not I sent you?

006:015 He said to him, Oh, Lord, with which shall I save Israel? behold,

        my family is the poorest in Manasseh, and I am the least

        in my father's house.

006:016 Yahweh said to him, Surely I will be with you, and you shall

        strike the Midianites as one man.

006:017 He said to him, If now I have found favor in your sight,

        then show me a sign that it is you who talk with me.

006:018 Please don't go away, until I come to you, and bring out

        my present, and lay it before you.  He said, I will wait

        until you come again.

006:019 Gideon went in, and made ready a kid, and unleavened cakes

        of an ephah of meal:  the flesh he put in a basket, and he put

        the broth in a pot, and brought it out to him under the oak,

        and presented it.

006:020 The angel of God said to him, Take the flesh and the unleavened

        cakes, and lay them on this rock, and pour out the broth.

        He did so.

006:021 Then the angel of Yahweh put forth the end of the staff that was

        in his hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes;

        and there went up fire out of the rock, and consumed the flesh

        and the unleavened cakes; and the angel of Yahweh departed

        out of his sight.

006:022 Gideon saw that he was the angel of Yahweh; and Gideon said,

        Alas, Lord Yahweh! because I have seen the angel of Yahweh

        face to face.

006:023 Yahweh said to him, Peace be to you; don't be afraid:

        you shall not die.

006:024 Then Gideon built an altar there to Yahweh, and called it

        Yahweh is Peace{or, Yahweh Shalom}: to this day it is still

        in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.

006:025 It happened the same night, that Yahweh said to him,

        Take your father's bull, even the second bull seven years old,

        and throw down the altar of Baal that your father has,

        and cut down the Asherah that is by it;

006:026 and build an altar to Yahweh your God on the top of this stronghold,

        in the orderly manner, and take the second bull, and offer

        a burnt offering with the wood of the Asherah which you

        shall cut down.

006:027 Then Gideon took ten men of his servants, and did as Yahweh

        had spoken to him:  and it happened, because he feared his

        father's household and the men of the city, so that he could

        not do it by day, that he did it by night.

006:028 When the men of the city arose early in the morning, behold,

        the altar of Baal was broken down, and the Asherah was cut

        down that was by it, and the second bull was offered on

        the altar that was built.

006:029 They said one to another, Who has done this thing?

        When they inquired and asked, they said, Gideon the son

        of Joash has done this thing.

006:030 Then the men of the city said to Joash, Bring out your son,

        that he may die, because he has broken down the altar of Baal,

        and because he has cut down the Asherah that was by it.

006:031 Joash said to all who stood against him, Will you contend

        for Baal?  Or will you save him? he who will contend for him,

        let him be put to death while [it is yet] morning:

        if he be a god, let him contend for himself, because one has

        broken down his altar.

006:032 Therefore on that day he named him Jerubbaal, saying, Let Baal

        contend against him, because he has broken down his altar.

006:033 Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children

        of the east assembled themselves together; and they passed over,

        and encamped in the valley of Jezreel.

006:034 But the Spirit of Yahweh came on Gideon; and he blew a trumpet;

        and Abiezer was gathered together after him.

006:035 He sent messengers throughout all Manasseh; and they also were

        gathered together after him:  and he sent messengers to Asher,

        and to Zebulun, and to Naphtali; and they came up to meet them.

006:036 Gideon said to God, If you will save Israel by my hand,

        as you have spoken,

006:037 behold, I will put a fleece of wool on the threshing floor;

        if there be dew on the fleece only, and it be dry on all the ground,

        then shall I know that you will save Israel by my hand,

        as you have spoken.

006:038 It was so; for he rose up early on the next day, and pressed

        the fleece together, and wrung the dew out of the fleece,

        a bowl full of water.

006:039 Gideon said to God, Don't let your anger be kindled against me,

        and I will speak but this once:  Please let me make a trial

        just this once with the fleece; let it now be dry only on

        the fleece, and on all the ground let there be dew.

006:040 God did so that night:  for it was dry on the fleece only,

        and there was dew on all the ground.

007:001 Then Jerubbaal, who is Gideon, and all the people who were with him,

        rose up early, and encamped beside the spring of Harod:

        and the camp of Midian was on the north side of them,

        by the hill of Moreh, in the valley.

007:002 Yahweh said to Gideon, The people who are with you are

        too many for me to give the Midianites into their hand,

        lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, My own hand

        has saved me.

007:003 Now therefore proclaim in the ears of the people, saying, Whoever is

        fearful and trembling, let him return and depart from Mount Gilead.

        There returned of the people twenty-two thousand; and there

        remained ten thousand.

007:004 Yahweh said to Gideon, The people are yet too many; bring them

        down to the water, and I will try them for you there:

        and it shall be, that of whom I tell you, This shall go with you,

        the same shall go with you; and of whoever I tell you,

        This shall not go with you, the same shall not go.

007:005 So he brought down the people to the water:  and Yahweh said

        to Gideon, Everyone who laps of the water with his tongue,

        as a dog laps, him shall you set by himself; likewise everyone

        who bows down on his knees to drink.

007:006 The number of those who lapped, putting their hand to their mouth,

        was three hundred men:  but all the rest of the people bowed

        down on their knees to drink water.

007:007 Yahweh said to Gideon, By the three hundred men who lapped

        will I save you, and deliver the Midianites into your hand;

        and let all the people go every man to his place.

007:008 So the people took food in their hand, and their trumpets;

        and he sent all the men of Israel every man to his tent,

        but retained the three hundred men:  and the camp of Midian

        was beneath him in the valley.

007:009 It happened the same night, that Yahweh said to him, Arise, get you

        down into the camp; for I have delivered it into your hand.

007:010 But if you fear to go down, go you with Purah your servant

        down to the camp:

007:011 and you shall hear what they say; and afterward shall

        your hands be strengthened to go down into the camp.

        Then went he down with Purah his servant to the outermost

        part of the armed men who were in the camp.

007:012 The Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of

        the east lay along in the valley like locusts for multitude;

        and their camels were without number, as the sand which is

        on the seashore for multitude.

007:013 When Gideon had come, behold, there was a man telling a dream

        to his fellow; and he said, Behold, I dreamed a dream;

        and behold, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the camp

        of Midian, and came to the tent, and struck it so that it fell,

        and turned it upside down, so that the tent lay flat.

007:014 His fellow answered, This is nothing else save the sword

        of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel:  into his hand

        God has delivered Midian, and all the army.

007:015 It was so, when Gideon heard the telling of the dream,

        and the interpretation of it, that he worshiped; and he returned

        into the camp of Israel, and said, Arise; for Yahweh has

        delivered into your hand the army of Midian.

007:016 He divided the three hundred men into three companies, and he put

        into the hands of all of them trumpets, and empty pitchers,

        with torches within the pitchers.

007:017 He said to them, Look on me, and do likewise:  and behold,

        when I come to the outermost part of the camp, it shall be that,

        as I do, so shall you do.

007:018 When I blow the trumpet, I and all who are with me, then blow

        you the trumpets also on every side of all the camp, and say,

        For Yahweh and for Gideon.

007:019 So Gideon, and the hundred men who were with him,

        came to the outermost part of the camp in the beginning

        of the middle watch, when they had but newly set the watch:

        and they blew the trumpets, and broke in pieces the pitchers

        that were in their hands.

007:020 The three companies blew the trumpets, and broke the pitchers,

        and held the torches in their left hands, and the trumpets

        in their right hands with which to blow; and they cried,

        The sword of Yahweh and of Gideon.

007:021 They stood every man in his place round about the camp;

        and all the army ran; and they shouted, and put [them] to flight.

007:022 They blew the three hundred trumpets, and Yahweh set every

        man's sword against his fellow, and against all the army;

        and the army fled as far as Beth Shittah toward Zererah,

        as far as the border of Abel Meholah, by Tabbath.

007:023 The men of Israel were gathered together out of Naphtali, and out

        of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and pursued after Midian.

007:024 Gideon sent messengers throughout all the hill country

        of Ephraim, saying, Come down against Midian, and take before

        them the waters, as far as Beth Barah, even the Jordan.

        So all the men of Ephraim were gathered together, and took

        the waters as far as Beth Barah, even the Jordan.

007:025 They took the two princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb;

        and they killed Oreb at the rock of Oreb, and Zeeb they

        killed at the winepress of Zeeb, and pursued Midian:

        and they brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon

        beyond the Jordan.

008:001 The men of Ephraim said to him, Why have you served us thus, that you

        didn't call us, when you went to fight with Midian?  They did

        chide with him sharply.

008:002 He said to them, What have I now done in comparison with you?

        Isn't the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than

        the vintage of Abiezer?

008:003 God has delivered into your hand the princes of Midian, Oreb

        and Zeeb:  and what was I able to do in comparison with you?

        Then their anger was abated toward him, when he had said that.

008:004 Gideon came to the Jordan, [and] passed over, he, and the three

        hundred men who were with him, faint, yet pursuing.

008:005 He said to the men of Succoth, Please give loaves of bread

        to the people who follow me; for they are faint, and I am

        pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian.

008:006 The princes of Succoth said, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna

        now in your hand, that we should give bread to your army?

008:007 Gideon said, Therefore when Yahweh has delivered Zebah and Zalmunna

        into my hand, then I will tear your flesh with the thorns

        of the wilderness and with briers.

008:008 He went up there to Penuel, and spoke to them in like manner;

        and the men of Penuel answered him as the men of

        Succoth had answered.

008:009 He spoke also to the men of Penuel, saying, When I come again

        in peace, I will break down this tower.

008:010 Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, and their armies with them,

        about fifteen thousand men, all who were left of all the army

        of the children of the east; for there fell one hundred twenty

        thousand men who drew sword.

008:011 Gideon went up by the way of those who lived in tents

        on the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and struck the army;

        for the army was secure.

008:012 Zebah and Zalmunna fled; and he pursued after them;

        and he took the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna,

        and confused all the army.

008:013 Gideon the son of Joash returned from the battle from

        the ascent of Heres.

008:014 He caught a young man of the men of Succoth, and inquired of him:

        and he described for him the princes of Succoth, and the elders

        of it, seventy-seven men.

008:015 He came to the men of Succoth, and said, See Zebah and Zalmunna,

        concerning whom you did taunt me, saying, Are the hands

        of Zebah and Zalmunna now in your hand, that we should give

        bread to your men who are weary?

008:016 He took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness

        and briers, and with them he taught the men of Succoth.

008:017 He broke down the tower of Penuel, and killed the men of the city.

008:018 Then said he to Zebah and Zalmunna, What manner of men were

        they whom you killed at Tabor?  They answered, As you are,

        so were they; each one resembled the children of a king.

008:019 He said, They were my brothers, the sons of my mother:

        as Yahweh lives, if you had saved them alive, I would

        not kill you.

008:020 He said to Jether his firstborn, Up, and kill them.

        But the youth didn't draw his sword; for he feared,

        because he was yet a youth.

008:021 Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, Rise you, and fall on us;

        for as the man is, so is his strength.  Gideon arose,

        and killed Zebah and Zalmunna, and took the crescents that

        were on their camels' necks.

008:022 Then the men of Israel said to Gideon, Rule you over us,

        both you, and your son, and your son's son also; for you

        have saved us out of the hand of Midian.

008:023 Gideon said to them, I will not rule over you, neither shall

        my son rule over you:  Yahweh shall rule over you.

008:024 Gideon said to them, I would make a request of you,

        that you would give me every man the earrings of his spoil.

        (For they had golden earrings, because they were Ishmaelites.)

008:025 They answered, We will willingly give them.  They spread a garment,

        and did cast therein every man the earrings of his spoil.

008:026 The weight of the golden earrings that he requested was one thousand

        and seven hundred [shekels] of gold, besides the crescents,

        and the pendants, and the purple clothing that was on

        the kings of Midian, and besides the chains that were about

        their camels' necks.

008:027 Gideon made an ephod of it, and put it in his city, even in Ophrah:

        and all Israel played the prostitute after it there;

        and it became a snare to Gideon, and to his house.

008:028 So Midian was subdued before the children of Israel, and they

        lifted up their heads no more.  The land had rest forty years

        in the days of Gideon.

008:029 Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and lived in his own house.

008:030 Gideon had seventy sons conceived from his body;

        for he had many wives.

008:031 His concubine who was in Shechem, she also bore him a son,

        and he named him Abimelech.

008:032 Gideon the son of Joash died in a good old age, and was buried

        in the tomb of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.

008:033 It happened, as soon as Gideon was dead, that the children of

        Israel turned again, and played the prostitute after the Baals,

        and made Baal Berith their god.

008:034 The children of Israel didn't remember Yahweh their God,

        who had delivered them out of the hand of all their enemies

        on every side;

008:035 neither shown they kindness to the house of Jerubbaal,

        [who is] Gideon, according to all the goodness which he had

        shown to Israel.

009:001 Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem to his

        mother's brothers, and spoke with them, and with all the family

        of the house of his mother's father, saying,

009:002 Please speak in the ears of all the men of Shechem, Whether is

        better for you, that all the sons of Jerubbaal, who are

        seventy persons, rule over you, or that one rule over you?

        Remember also that I am your bone and your flesh.

009:003 His mother's brothers spoke of him in the ears of all the men

        of Shechem all these words:  and their hearts inclined

        to follow Abimelech; for they said, He is our brother.

009:004 They gave him seventy [pieces] of silver out of the house of

        Baal Berith, with which Abimelech hired vain and light fellows,

        who followed him.

009:005 He went to his father's house at Ophrah, and killed his brothers

        the sons of Jerubbaal, being seventy persons, on one stone:

        but Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left;

        for he hid himself.

009:006 All the men of Shechem assembled themselves together,

        and all the house of Millo, and went and made Abimelech king,

        by the oak of the pillar that was in Shechem.

009:007 When they told it to Jotham, he went and stood on the top

        of Mount Gerizim, and lifted up his voice, and cried,

        and said to them, Listen to me, you men of Shechem, that God

        may listen to you.

009:008 The trees went forth on a time to anoint a king over them;

        and they said to the olive tree, Reign you over us.

009:009 But the olive tree said to them, Should I leave my fatness,

        with which by me they honor God and man, and go to wave back

        and forth over the trees?

009:010 The trees said to the fig tree, Come you, and reign over us.

009:011 But the fig tree said to them, Should I leave my sweetness,

        and my good fruit, and go to wave back and forth over the trees?

009:012 The trees said to the vine, Come you, and reign over us.

009:013 The vine said to them, Should I leave my new wine, which cheers

        God and man, and go to wave back and forth over the trees?

009:014 Then said all the trees to the bramble, Come you,

        and reign over us.

009:015 The bramble said to the trees, If in truth you anoint me

        king over you, then come and take refuge in my shade;

        and if not, let fire come out of the bramble, and devour

        the cedars of Lebanon.

009:016 Now therefore, if you have dealt truly and righteously,

        in that you have made Abimelech king, and if you have dealt

        well with Jerubbaal and his house, and have done to him

        according to the deserving of his hands

009:017 (for my father fought for you, and adventured his life,

        and delivered you out of the hand of Midian:

009:018 and you are risen up against my father's house this day,

        and have slain his sons, seventy persons, on one stone,

        and have made Abimelech, the son of his female servant,

        king over the men of Shechem, because he is your brother);

009:019 if you then have dealt truly and righteously with Jerubbaal

        and with his house this day, then rejoice you in Abimelech,

        and let him also rejoice in you:

009:020 but if not, let fire come out from Abimelech, and devour

        the men of Shechem, and the house of Millo; and let fire come

        out from the men of Shechem, and from the house of Millo,

        and devour Abimelech.

009:021 Jotham ran away, and fled, and went to Beer, and lived there,

        for fear of Abimelech his brother.

009:022 Abimelech was prince over Israel three years.

009:023 God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of Shechem;

        and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech:

009:024 that the violence done to the seventy sons of Jerubbaal might come,

        and that their blood might be laid on Abimelech their brother,

        who killed them, and on the men of Shechem, who strengthened

        his hands to kill his brothers.

009:025 The men of Shechem set an ambush for him on the tops of the mountains,

        and they robbed all who came along that way by them:

        and it was told Abimelech.

009:026 Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brothers, and went over

        to Shechem; and the men of Shechem put their trust in him.

009:027 They went out into the field, and gathered their vineyards,

        and trod [the grapes], and held festival, and went into the house

        of their god, and did eat and drink, and cursed Abimelech.

009:028 Gaal the son of Ebed said, Who is Abimelech, and who is Shechem,

        that we should serve him?  Isn't he the son of Jerubbaal? and Zebul

        his officer? serve you the men of Hamor the father of Shechem:

        but why should we serve him?

009:029 Would that this people were under my hand! then would I

        remove Abimelech.  He said to Abimelech, Increase your army,

        and come out.

009:030 When Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal

        the son of Ebed, his anger was kindled.

009:031 He sent messengers to Abimelech craftily, saying, Behold, Gaal the

        son of Ebed and his brothers are come to Shechem; and behold,

        they constrain the city [to take part] against you.

009:032 Now therefore, up by night, you and the people who are with you,

        and lie in wait in the field:

009:033 and it shall be, that in the morning, as soon as the sun is up,

        you shall rise early, and rush on the city; and behold,

        when he and the people who are with him come out against you,

        then may you do to them as you shall find occasion.

009:034 Abimelech rose up, and all the people who were with him, by night,

        and they laid wait against Shechem in four companies.

009:035 Gaal the son of Ebed went out, and stood in the entrance of

        the gate of the city:  and Abimelech rose up, and the people

        who were with him, from the ambush.

009:036 When Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, Behold, there come

        people down from the tops of the mountains.  Zebul said to him,

        You see the shadow of the mountains as if they were men.

009:037 Gaal spoke again and said, Behold, there come people down

        by the middle of the land, and one company comes by the way

        of the oak of Meonenim.

009:038 Then said Zebul to him, Where is now your mouth, that you said,

        Who is Abimelech, that we should serve him? is not this

        the people that you have despised? go out now, I pray,

        and fight with them.

009:039 Gaal went out before the men of Shechem, and fought with Abimelech.

009:040 Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him, and there fell

        many wounded, even to the entrance of the gate.

009:041 Abimelech lived at Arumah:  and Zebul drove out Gaal and

        his brothers, that they should not dwell in Shechem.

009:042 It happened on the next day, that the people went out into the field;

        and they told Abimelech.

009:043 He took the people, and divided them into three companies,

        and laid wait in the field; and he looked, and behold,

        the people came forth out of the city; He rose up against them,

        and struck them.

009:044 Abimelech, and the companies that were with him, rushed forward,

        and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city:

        and the two companies rushed on all who were in the field,

        and struck them.

009:045 Abimelech fought against the city all that day; and he took

        the city, and killed the people who were therein:

        and he beat down the city, and sowed it with salt.

009:046 When all the men of the tower of Shechem heard of it,

        they entered into the stronghold of the house of Elberith.

009:047 It was told Abimelech that all the men of the tower of Shechem

        were gathered together.

009:048 Abimelech got him up to Mount Zalmon, he and all the people

        who were with him; and Abimelech took an axe in his hand,

        and cut down a bough from the trees, and took it up,

        and laid it on his shoulder:  and he said to the people

        who were with him, What you have seen me do, make haste,

        and do as I have done.

009:049 All the people likewise cut down every man his bough,

        and followed Abimelech, and put them to the stronghold,

        and set the stronghold on fire on them; so that all the men

        of the tower of Shechem died also, about a thousand men and women.

009:050 Then went Abimelech to Thebez, and encamped against Thebez,

        and took it.

009:051 But there was a strong tower within the city, and there fled

        all the men and women, and all they of the city, and shut

        themselves in, and got them up to the roof of the tower.

009:052 Abimelech came to the tower, and fought against it, and drew

        near to the door of the tower to burn it with fire.

009:053 A certain woman cast an upper millstone on Abimelech's head,

        and broke his skull.

009:054 Then he called hastily to the young man his armor bearer,

        and said to him, Draw your sword, and kill me, that men not say

        of me, A woman killed him.  His young man thrust him through,

        and he died.

009:055 When the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they departed

        every man to his place.

009:056 Thus God requited the wickedness of Abimelech, which he did

        to his father, in killing his seventy brothers;

009:057 and all the wickedness of the men of Shechem did God requite

        on their heads:  and on them came the curse of Jotham

        the son of Jerubbaal.

010:001 After Abimelech there arose to save Israel Tola the son of Puah,

        the son of Dodo, a man of Issachar; and he lived in Shamir

        in the hill country of Ephraim.

010:002 He judged Israel twenty-three years, and died, and was

        buried in Shamir.

010:003 After him arose Jair, the Gileadite; and he judged

        Israel twenty-two years.

010:004 He had thirty sons who rode on thirty donkey colts, and they

        had thirty cities, which are called Havvoth Jair to this day,

        which are in the land of Gilead.

010:005 Jair died, and was buried in Kamon.

010:006 The children of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight

        of Yahweh, and served the Baals, and the Ashtaroth, and the gods

        of Syria, and the gods of Sidon, and the gods of Moab, and the gods

        of the children of Ammon, and the gods of the Philistines;

        and they forsook Yahweh, and didn't serve him.

010:007 The anger of Yahweh was kindled against Israel, and he sold

        them into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand

        of the children of Ammon.

010:008 They vexed and oppressed the children of Israel that year:

        eighteen years [oppressed they] all the children of Israel

        that were beyond the Jordan in the land of the Amorites,

        which is in Gilead.

010:009 The children of Ammon passed over the Jordan to fight also

        against Judah, and against Benjamin, and against the house

        of Ephraim; so that Israel was sore distressed.

010:010 The children of Israel cried to Yahweh, saying, We have

        sinned against you, even because we have forsaken our God,

        and have served the Baals.

010:011 Yahweh said to the children of Israel, Didn't I save you from

        the Egyptians, and from the Amorites, from the children of Ammon,

        and from the Philistines?

010:012 The Sidonians also, and the Amalekites, and the Maonites,

        did oppress you; and you cried to me, and I saved you out

        of their hand.

010:013 Yet you have forsaken me, and served other gods:

        therefore I will save you no more.

010:014 Go and cry to the gods which you have chosen; let them save

        you in the time of your distress.

010:015 The children of Israel said to Yahweh, We have sinned:

        do you to us whatever seems good to you; only deliver us,

        we pray you, this day.

010:016 They put away the foreign gods from among them, and served Yahweh;

        and his soul was grieved for the misery of Israel.

010:017 Then the children of Ammon were gathered together, and encamped

        in Gilead.  The children of Israel assembled themselves together,

        and encamped in Mizpah.

010:018 The people, the princes of Gilead, said one to another,

        What man is he who will begin to fight against the children

        of Ammon? he shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.

011:001 Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of valor,

        and he was the son of a prostitute:  and Gilead became

        the father of Jephthah.

011:002 Gilead's wife bore him sons; and when his wife's sons grew up,

        they drove out Jephthah, and said to him, You shall not inherit

        in our father's house; for you are the son of another woman.

011:003 Then Jephthah fled from his brothers, and lived in the land of Tob:

        and there were gathered vain fellows to Jephthah, and they

        went out with him.

011:004 It happened after a while, that the children of Ammon made

        war against Israel.

011:005 It was so, that when the children of Ammon made war against Israel,

        the elders of Gilead went to get Jephthah out of the land of Tob;

011:006 and they said to Jephthah, Come and be our chief, that we

        may fight with the children of Ammon.

011:007 Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, Didn't you hate me,

        and drive me out of my father's house? and why are you come

        to me now when you are in distress?

011:008 The elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, Therefore are we

        turned again to you now, that you may go with us, and fight

        with the children of Ammon; and you shall be our head over

        all the inhabitants of Gilead.

011:009 Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, If you bring me home

        again to fight with the children of Ammon, and Yahweh deliver

        them before me, shall I be your head?

011:010 The elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, Yahweh shall be witness

        between us; surely according to your word so will we do.

011:011 Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people

        made him head and chief over them:  and Jephthah spoke all

        his words before Yahweh in Mizpah.

011:012 Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the children of Ammon,

        saying, What have you to do with me, that you are come to me

        to fight against my land?

011:013 The king of the children of Ammon answered to the messengers

        of Jephthah, Because Israel took away my land, when he came up out

        of Egypt, from the Arnon even to the Jabbok, and to the Jordan:

        now therefore restore those [lands] again peaceably.

011:014 Jephthah sent messengers again to the king of the children of Ammon;

011:015 and he said to him, Thus says Jephthah:  Israel didn't take

        away the land of Moab, nor the land of the children of Ammon,

011:016 but when they came up from Egypt, and Israel went

        through the wilderness to the Red Sea{or, Sea of Reeds},

        and came to Kadesh;

011:017 then Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying, Please let

        me pass through your land; but the king of Edom didn't listen.

        In the same way, he sent to the king of Moab; but he would not:

        and Israel abode in Kadesh.

011:018 Then they went through the wilderness, and went around the land

        of Edom, and the land of Moab, and came by the east side

        of the land of Moab, and they encamped on the other side

        of the Arnon; but they didn't come within the border of Moab,

        for the Arnon was the border of Moab.

011:019 Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites,

        the king of Heshbon; and Israel said to him, Let us pass,

        we pray you, through your land to my place.

011:020 But Sihon didn't trust Israel to pass through his border;

        but Sihon gathered all his people together, and encamped in Jahaz,

        and fought against Israel.

011:021 Yahweh, the God of Israel, delivered Sihon and all his

        people into the hand of Israel, and they struck them:

        so Israel possessed all the land of the Amorites, the inhabitants

        of that country.

011:022 They possessed all the border of the Amorites, from the Arnon

        even to the Jabbok, and from the wilderness even to the Jordan.

011:023 So now Yahweh, the God of Israel, has dispossessed the Amorites

        from before his people Israel, and should you possess them?

011:024 Won't you possess that which Chemosh your god gives you to possess?

        So whoever Yahweh our God has dispossessed from before us,

        them will we possess.

011:025 Now are you anything better than Balak the son of Zippor,

        king of Moab? did he ever strive against Israel, or did

        he ever fight against them?

011:026 While Israel lived in Heshbon and its towns, and in Aroer

        and its towns, and in all the cities that are along by the side

        of the Arnon, three hundred years; why didn't you recover

        them within that time?

011:027 I therefore have not sinned against you, but you do me wrong

        to war against me:  Yahweh, the Judge, be judge this day

        between the children of Israel and the children of Ammon.

011:028 However the king of the children of Ammon didn't listen

        to the words of Jephthah which he sent him.

011:029 Then the Spirit of Yahweh came on Jephthah, and he passed

        over Gilead and Manasseh, and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead,

        and from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over to the children of Ammon.

011:030 Jephthah vowed a vow to Yahweh, and said, If you will indeed

        deliver the children of Ammon into my hand,

011:031 then it shall be, that whatever comes forth from the doors

        of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children

        of Ammon, it shall be Yahweh's, and I will offer it up

        for a burnt offering.

011:032 So Jephthah passed over to the children of Ammon to fight

        against them; and Yahweh delivered them into his hand.

011:033 He struck them from Aroer until you come to Minnith, even twenty

        cities, and to Abelcheramim, with a very great slaughter.

        So the children of Ammon were subdued before the children of Israel.

011:034 Jephthah came to Mizpah to his house; and behold, his daughter

        came out to meet him with tambourines and with dances:

        and she was his only child; besides her he had neither

        son nor daughter.

011:035 It happened, when he saw her, that he tore his clothes,

        and said, Alas, my daughter! you have brought me very low,

        and you are one of those who trouble me; for I have opened

        my mouth to Yahweh, and I can't go back.

011:036 She said to him, My father, you have opened your mouth to Yahweh;

        do to me according to that which has proceeded out of your mouth,

        because Yahweh has taken vengeance for you on your enemies,

        even on the children of Ammon.

011:037 She said to her father, Let this thing be done for me:

        let me alone two months, that I may depart and go down on

        the mountains, and bewail my virginity, I and my companions.

011:038 He said, Go.  He sent her away for two months:

        and she departed, she and her companions, and mourned her

        virginity on the mountains.

011:039 It happened at the end of two months, that she returned to her father,

        who did with her according to his vow which he had vowed:

        and she was a virgin.  It was a custom in Israel,

011:040 that the daughters of Israel went yearly to celebrate the daughter

        of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in a year.

012:001 The men of Ephraim were gathered together, and passed northward;

        and they said to Jephthah, Why did you pass over to fight

        against the children of Ammon, and didn't call us to go

        with you? we will burn your house on you with fire.

012:002 Jephthah said to them, I and my people were at great strife

        with the children of Ammon; and when I called you, you didn't

        save me out of their hand.

012:003 When I saw that you didn't save me, I put my life in my hand,

        and passed over against the children of Ammon, and Yahweh

        delivered them into my hand:  why then are you come up to me

        this day, to fight against me?

012:004 Then Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead,

        and fought with Ephraim; and the men of Gilead struck Ephraim,

        because they said, You are fugitives of Ephraim, you Gileadites,

        in the midst of Ephraim, [and] in the midst of Manasseh.

012:005 The Gileadites took the fords of the Jordan against the Ephraimites.

        It was so, that when [any of] the fugitives of Ephraim said,

        Let me go over, the men of Gilead said to him, Are you

        an Ephraimite?  If he said, No;

012:006 then said they to him, Say now Shibboleth; and he said Sibboleth;

        for he couldn't manage to pronounce it right:  then they laid

        hold on him, and killed him at the fords of the Jordan.

        There fell at that time of Ephraim forty-two thousand.

012:007 Jephthah judged Israel six years.  Then died Jephthah the Gileadite,

        and was buried in [one of] the cities of Gilead.

012:008 After him Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel.

012:009 He had thirty sons; and thirty daughters he sent abroad,

        and thirty daughters he brought in from abroad for his sons.

        He judged Israel seven years.

012:010 Ibzan died, and was buried at Bethlehem.

012:011 After him Elon the Zebulunite judged Israel; and he judged

        Israel ten years.

012:012 Elon the Zebulunite died, and was buried in Aijalon in the

        land of Zebulun.

012:013 After him Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite judged Israel.

012:014 He had forty sons and thirty sons' sons, who rode on seventy

        donkey colts:  and he judged Israel eight years.

012:015 Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died, and was buried

        in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the hill country

        of the Amalekites.

013:001 The children of Israel again did that which was evil in

        the sight of Yahweh; and Yahweh delivered them into the hand

        of the Philistines forty years.

013:002 There was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the Danites,

        whose name was Manoah; and his wife was barren, and didn't bear.

013:003 The angel of Yahweh appeared to the woman, and said to her,

        See now, you are barren, and don't bear; but you shall conceive,

        and bear a son.

013:004 Now therefore please beware and drink no wine nor strong drink,

        and don't eat any unclean thing:

013:005 for, behold, you shall conceive, and bear a son; and no razor

        shall come on his head; for the child shall be a Nazirite

        to God from the womb:  and he shall begin to save Israel

        out of the hand of the Philistines.

013:006 Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of God

        came to me, and his face was like the face of the angel

        of God, very awesome; and I didn't ask him whence he was,

        neither did he tell me his name:

013:007 but he said to me, Behold, you shall conceive, and bear a son;

        and now drink no wine nor strong drink, and eat not any

        unclean thing; for the child shall be a Nazirite to God

        from the womb to the day of his death.

013:008 Then Manoah entreated Yahweh, and said, Oh, Lord, please let

        the man of God whom you did send come again to us, and teach

        us what we shall do to the child who shall be born.

013:009 God listened to the voice of Manoah; and the angel of God

        came again to the woman as she sat in the field:

        but Manoah, her husband, wasn't with her.

013:010 The woman made haste, and ran, and told her husband, and said

        to him, Behold, the man has appeared to me, who came to me

        the [other] day.

013:011 Manoah arose, and went after his wife, and came to the man,

        and said to him, Are you the man who spoke to the woman?

        He said, I am.

013:012 Manoah said, Now let your words happen:  what shall be the ordering

        of the child, and [how] shall we do to him?

013:013 The angel of Yahweh said to Manoah, Of all that I said

        to the woman let her beware.

013:014 She may not eat of anything that comes of the vine, neither let

        her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing;

        all that I commanded her let her observe.

013:015 Manoah said to the angel of Yahweh, I pray you, let us detain you,

        that we may make ready a kid for you.

013:016 The angel of Yahweh said to Manoah, Though you detain me,

        I won't eat of your bread; and if you will make ready

        a burnt offering, you must offer it to Yahweh.

        For Manoah didn't know that he was the angel of Yahweh.

013:017 Manoah said to the angel of Yahweh, What is your name,

        that when your words happen, we may honor you?

013:018 The angel of Yahweh said to him, Why do you ask after my name,

        seeing it is wonderful?

013:019 So Manoah took the kid with the meal offering, and offered

        it on the rock to Yahweh:  and [the angel] did wondrously,

        and Manoah and his wife looked on.

013:020 For it happened, when the flame went up toward the sky

        from off the altar, that the angel of Yahweh ascended in

        the flame of the altar:  and Manoah and his wife looked on;

        and they fell on their faces to the ground.

013:021 But the angel of Yahweh did no more appear to Manoah or to his wife.

        Then Manoah knew that he was the angel of Yahweh.

013:022 Manoah said to his wife, We shall surely die, because we

        have seen God.

013:023 But his wife said to him, If Yahweh were pleased to kill us,

        he wouldn't have received a burnt offering and a meal offering

        at our hand, neither would he have shown us all these things,

        nor would at this time have told such things as these.

013:024 The woman bore a son, and named him Samson:  and the child grew,

        and Yahweh blessed him.

013:025 The Spirit of Yahweh began to move him in Mahaneh Dan,

        between Zorah and Eshtaol.

014:001 Samson went down to Timnah, and saw a woman in Timnah of

        the daughters of the Philistines.

014:002 He came up, and told his father and his mother, and said,

        I have seen a woman in Timnah of the daughters of the Philistines:

        now therefore get her for me as wife.

014:003 Then his father and his mother said to him, Is there

        never a woman among the daughters of your brothers,

        or among all my people, that you go to take a wife of

        the uncircumcised Philistines?  Samson said to his father,

        Get her for me; for she pleases me well.

014:004 But his father and his mother didn't know that it was of Yahweh;

        for he sought an occasion against the Philistines.

        Now at that time the Philistines had rule over Israel.

014:005 Then went Samson down, and his father and his mother,

        to Timnah, and came to the vineyards of Timnah:  and behold,

        a young lion roared against him.

014:006 The Spirit of Yahweh came mightily on him, and he tore him

        as he would have torn a kid; and he had nothing in his hand:

        but he didn't tell his father or his mother what he had done.

014:007 He went down, and talked with the woman, and she pleased Samson well.

014:008 After a while he returned to take her; and he turned aside

        to see the carcass of the lion:  and behold, there was a swarm

        of bees in the body of the lion, and honey.

014:009 He took it into his hands, and went on, eating as he went;

        and he came to his father and mother, and gave to them,

        and they ate:  but he didn't tell them that he had taken

        the honey out of the body of the lion.

014:010 His father went down to the woman:  and Samson made there a feast;

        for so used the young men to do.

014:011 It happened, when they saw him, that they brought thirty

        companions to be with him.

014:012 Samson said to them, Let me now put forth a riddle to you:

        if you can declare it to me within the seven days of the feast,

        and find it out, then I will give you thirty linen garments

        and thirty changes of clothing;

014:013 but if you can't declare it to me, then shall you give me

        thirty linen garments and thirty changes of clothing.

        They said to him, Put forth your riddle, that we may hear it.

014:014 He said to them, Out of the eater came forth food.

        Out of the strong came forth sweetness.  They couldn't

        in three days declare the riddle.

014:015 It happened on the seventh day, that they said to Samson's wife,

        Entice your husband, that he may declare to us the riddle,

        lest we burn you and your father's house with fire:

        have you called us to impoverish us? is it not [so]?

014:016 Samson's wife wept before him, and said, You do but hate me,

        and don't love me:  you have put forth a riddle

        to the children of my people, and haven't told it me.

        He said to her, Behold, I haven't told it my father nor my mother,

        and shall I tell you?

014:017 She wept before him the seven days, while their feast lasted:

        and it happened on the seventh day, that he told her,

        because she pressed him sore; and she told the riddle

        to the children of her people.

014:018 The men of the city said to him on the seventh day before the sun

        went down, What is sweeter than honey? and what is stronger than

        a lion?  He said to them, If you hadn't plowed with my heifer,

        you wouldn't have found out my riddle.

014:019 The Spirit of Yahweh came mightily on him, and he went down

        to Ashkelon, and struck thirty men of them, and took their spoil,

        and gave the changes [of clothing] to those who declared the riddle.

        His anger was kindled, and he went up to his father's house.

014:020 But Samson's wife was [given] to his companion, whom he had

        used as his friend.

015:001 But it happened after a while, in the time of wheat harvest,

        that Samson visited his wife with a kid; and he said,

        I will go in to my wife into the chamber.  But her father

        wouldn't allow him to go in.

015:002 Her father said, I most certainly thought that you had

        utterly hated her; therefore I gave her to your companion:

        isn't her younger sister more beautiful than she?

        Please take her, instead.

015:003 Samson said to them, This time shall I be blameless in regard

        of the Philistines, when I do them a mischief.

015:004 Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took firebrands,

        and turned tail to tail, and put a firebrand in the midst

        between every two tails.

015:005 When he had set the brands on fire, he let them go into

        the standing grain of the Philistines, and burnt up both

        the shocks and the standing grain, and also the olive groves.

015:006 Then the Philistines said, Who has done this?  They said, Samson,

        the son-in-law of the Timnite, because he has taken his wife,

        and given her to his companion.  The Philistines came up,

        and burnt her and her father with fire.

015:007 Samson said to them, If you do after this manner, surely I

        will be avenged of you, and after that I will cease.

015:008 He struck them hip and thigh with a great slaughter:

        and he went down and lived in the cleft of the rock of Etam.

015:009 Then the Philistines went up, and encamped in Judah, and spread

        themselves in Lehi.

015:010 The men of Judah said, Why are you come up against us?

        They said, To bind Samson are we come up, to do to him

        as he has done to us.

015:011 Then three thousand men of Judah went down to the cleft of the rock

        of Etam, and said to Samson, "Don't you know that the Philistines

        are rulers over us?  What then is this that you have done to us?"

        He said to them, As they did to me, so have I done to them.

015:012 They said to him, We have come down to bind you, that we

        may deliver you into the hand of the Philistines.

        Samson said to them, Swear to me that you will not fall

        on me yourselves.

015:013 They spoke to him, saying, No; but we will bind you fast,

        and deliver you into their hand:  but surely we will not kill you.

        They bound him with two new ropes, and brought him up

        from the rock.

015:014 When he came to Lehi, the Philistines shouted as they met him:

        and the Spirit of Yahweh came mightily on him, and the ropes

        that were on his arms became as flax that was burnt with fire,

        and his bands dropped from off his hands.

015:015 He found a fresh jawbone of a donkey, and put forth his hand,

        and took it, and struck a thousand men therewith.

015:016 Samson said, With the jawbone of a donkey, heaps on heaps,

        With the jawbone of a donkey I have struck a thousand men.

015:017 It happened, when he had made an end of speaking, that he cast

        away the jawbone out of his hand; and that place was

        called Ramath Lehi.

015:018 He was very thirsty, and called on Yahweh, and said, You have

        given this great deliverance by the hand of your servant;

        and now shall I die for thirst, and fall into the hand

        of the uncircumcised.

015:019 But God split the hollow place that is in Lehi, and water came out

        of it.  When he had drunk, his spirit came again, and he revived:

        therefore the name of it was called En Hakkore, which is in Lehi,

        to this day.

015:020 He judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty years.

016:001 Samson went to Gaza, and saw there a prostitute, and went

        in to her.

016:002 [It was told] the Gazites, saying, Samson is come here.

        They compassed him in, and laid wait for him all night in the gate

        of the city, and were quiet all the night, saying, [Let be]

        until morning light, then we will kill him.

016:003 Samson lay until midnight, and arose at midnight, and laid

        hold of the doors of the gate of the city, and the two posts,

        and plucked them up, bar and all, and put them on his shoulders,

        and carried them up to the top of the mountain that

        is before Hebron.

016:004 It came to pass afterward, that he loved a woman in the valley

        of Sorek, whose name was Delilah.

016:005 The lords of the Philistines came up to her, and said to her,

        Entice him, and see in which his great strength lies,

        and by what means we may prevail against him, that we may bind

        him to afflict him:  and we will each give you of us eleven

        hundred [pieces] of silver.

016:006 Delilah said to Samson, Tell me, Please, in which your great

        strength lies, and with which you might be bound to afflict you.

016:007 Samson said to her, If they bind me with seven green cords

        that were never dried, then shall I become weak, and be

        as another man.

016:008 Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven green

        cords which had not been dried, and she bound him with them.

016:009 Now she had an ambush waiting in the inner chamber.

        She said to him, "The Philistines are on you, Samson!"  He broke

        the cords, as a string of tow is broken when it touches the fire.

        So his strength was not known.

016:010 Delilah said to Samson, Behold, you have mocked me, and told me lies:

        now tell me, Please, with which you might be bound.

016:011 He said to her, If they only bind me with new ropes with

        which no work has been done, then shall I become weak,

        and be as another man.

016:012 So Delilah took new ropes, and bound him therewith,

        and said to him, The Philistines are on you, Samson.

        The ambush was waiting in the inner chamber.  He broke them

        off his arms like a thread.

016:013 Delilah said to Samson, Hitherto you have mocked me,

        and told me lies:  tell me with which you might be bound.

        He said to her, If you weave the seven locks of my head

        with the web.

016:014 She fastened it with the pin, and said to him, The Philistines

        are on you, Samson.  He awakened out of his sleep, and plucked

        away the pin of the beam, and the web.

016:015 She said to him, How can you say, I love you, when your heart

        is not with me? you have mocked me these three times,

        and have not told me in which your great strength lies.

016:016 It happened, when she pressed him daily with her words,

        and urged him, that his soul was vexed to death.

016:017 He told her all his heart, and said to her, "No razor has ever

        come on my head; for I have been a Nazirite to God from my

        mother's womb.  If I am shaved, then my strength will go from me,

        and I will become weak, and be like any other man."

016:018 When Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart,

        she sent and called for the lords of the Philistines, saying,

        Come up this once, for he has told me all his heart.

        Then the lords of the Philistines came up to her, and brought

        the money in their hand.

016:019 She made him sleep on her knees; and she called for a man,

        and shaved off the seven locks of his head; and she began

        to afflict him, and his strength went from him.

016:020 She said, The Philistines are on you, Samson.  He awoke out

        of his sleep, and said, I will go out as at other times,

        and shake myself free.  But he didn't know that Yahweh had

        departed from him.

016:021 The Philistines laid hold on him, and put out his eyes; and they

        brought him down to Gaza, and bound him with fetters of brass;

        and he ground at the mill in the prison.

016:022 However the hair of his head began to grow again after

        he was shaved.

016:023 The lords of the Philistines gathered them together to offer

        a great sacrifice to Dagon their god, and to rejoice;

        for they said, Our god has delivered Samson our enemy

        into our hand.

016:024 When the people saw him, they praised their god; for they said,

        Our god has delivered into our hand our enemy, and the destroyer

        of our country, who has slain many of us.

016:025 It happened, when their hearts were merry, that they said,

        Call for Samson, that he may make us sport.  They called

        for Samson out of the prison; and he made sport before them.

        They set him between the pillars:

016:026 and Samson said to the boy who held him by the hand, Allow me

        that I may feel the pillars whereupon the house rests,

        that I may lean on them.

016:027 Now the house was full of men and women; and all the lords

        of the Philistines were there; and there were on the roof about

        three thousand men and women, who saw while Samson made sport.

016:028 Samson called to Yahweh, and said, Lord Yahweh, remember me,

        Please, and strengthen me, Please, only this once, God, that I

        may be at once avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes.

016:029 Samson took hold of the two middle pillars on which the

        house rested, and leaned on them, the one with his right hand,

        and the other with his left.

016:030 Samson said, Let me die with the Philistines.

        He bowed himself with all his might; and the house fell

        on the lords, and on all the people who were therein.

        So the dead that he killed at his death were more than those

        who he killed in his life.

016:031 Then his brothers and all the house of his father came down,

        and took him, and brought him up, and buried him between

        Zorah and Eshtaol in the burial site of Manoah his father.

        He judged Israel twenty years.

017:001 There was a man of the hill country of Ephraim, whose name was Micah.

017:002 He said to his mother, The eleven hundred [pieces] of silver

        that were taken from you, about which you did utter a curse,

        and did also speak it in my ears, behold, the silver is with me;

        I took it.  His mother said, Blessed be my son of Yahweh.

017:003 He restored the eleven hundred [pieces] of silver to his mother;

        and his mother said, I most certainly dedicate the silver

        to Yahweh from my hand for my son, to make an engraved image

        and a molten image:  now therefore I will restore it to you.

017:004 When he restored the money to his mother, his mother took

        two hundred [pieces] of silver, and gave them to the founder,

        who made of it an engraved image and a molten image:

        and it was in the house of Micah.

017:005 The man Micah had a house of gods, and he made an ephod, and teraphim,

        and consecrated one of his sons, who became his priest.

017:006 In those days there was no king in Israel:  every man did

        that which was right in his own eyes.

017:007 There was a young man out of Bethlehem Judah, of the family

        of Judah, who was a Levite; and he sojourned there.

017:008 The man departed out of the city, out of Bethlehem Judah,

        to sojourn where he could find [a place], and he came

        to the hill country of Ephraim to the house of Micah,

        as he traveled.

017:009 Micah said to him, Whence come you?  He said to him, I am

        a Levite of Bethlehem Judah, and I go to sojourn where I

        may find [a place].

017:010 Micah said to him, Dwell with me, and be to me a father

        and a priest, and I will give you ten [pieces] of silver

        by the year, and a suit of clothing, and your food.

        So the Levite went in.

017:011 The Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the young

        man was to him as one of his sons.

017:012 Micah consecrated the Levite, and the young man became his priest,

        and was in the house of Micah.

017:013 Then said Micah, Now know I that Yahweh will do me good,

        seeing I have a Levite to my priest.

018:001 In those days there was no king in Israel:  and in those days

        the tribe of the Danites sought them an inheritance to dwell in;

        for to that day [their] inheritance had not fallen to them

        among the tribes of Israel.

018:002 The children of Dan sent of their family five men from their

        whole number, men of valor, from Zorah, and from Eshtaol,

        to spy out the land, and to search it; and they said to them,

        Go, search the land.  They came to the hill country of Ephraim,

        to the house of Micah, and lodged there.

018:003 When they were by the house of Micah, they knew the voice

        of the young man the Levite; and they turned aside there,

        and said to him, Who brought you here? and what do you in this

        place? and what have you here?

018:004 He said to them, Thus and thus has Micah dealt with me,

        and he has hired me, and I am become his priest.

018:005 They said to him, Ask counsel, we pray you, of God, that we

        may know whether our way which we go shall be prosperous.

018:006 The priest said to them, Go in peace:  before Yahweh is your

        way wherein you go.

018:007 Then the five men departed, and came to Laish, and saw

        the people who were therein, how they lived in security,

        after the manner of the Sidonians, quiet and secure;

        for there was none in the land, possessing authority,

        that might put [them] to shame in anything, and they were far

        from the Sidonians, and had no dealings with any man.

018:008 They came to their brothers to Zorah and Eshtaol:

        and their brothers said to them, What [say] you?

018:009 They said, Arise, and let us go up against them;

        for we have seen the land, and behold, it is very good:

        and are you still? don't be slothful to go and to enter

        in to possess the land.

018:010 When you go, you shall come to a people secure, and the land

        is large; for God has given it into your hand, a place

        where there is no want of anything that is in the earth.

018:011 There set forth from there of the family of the Danites,

        out of Zorah and out of Eshtaol, six hundred men girt with

        weapons of war.

018:012 They went up, and encamped in Kiriath Jearim, in Judah:

        therefore they called that place Mahaneh Dan, to this day;

        behold, it is behind Kiriath Jearim.

018:013 They passed there to the hill country of Ephraim, and came

        to the house of Micah.

018:014 Then the five men who went to spy out the country of Laish answered,

        and said to their brothers, Do you know that there is in

        these houses an ephod, and teraphim, and an engraved image,

        and a molten image? now therefore consider what you have to do.

018:015 They turned aside there, and came to the house of the young

        man the Levite, even to the house of Micah, and asked him

        of his welfare.

018:016 The six hundred men girt with their weapons of war, who were

        of the children of Dan, stood by the entrance of the gate.

018:017 The five men who went to spy out the land went up, and came

        in there, and took the engraved image, and the ephod,

        and the teraphim, and the molten image:  and the priest stood

        by the entrance of the gate with the six hundred men girt

        with weapons of war.

018:018 When these went into Micah's house, and fetched the engraved image,

        the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image, the priest

        said to them, What do you?

018:019 They said to him, Hold your peace, lay your hand on your mouth,

        and go with us, and be to us a father and a priest:

        is it better for you to be priest to the house of one man,

        or to be priest to a tribe and a family in Israel?

018:020 The priest's heart was glad, and he took the ephod, and the teraphim,

        and the engraved image, and went in the midst of the people.

018:021 So they turned and departed, and put the little ones and

        the livestock and the goods before them.

018:022 When they were a good way from the house of Micah, the men who

        were in the houses near to Micah's house were gathered together,

        and overtook the children of Dan.

018:023 They cried to the children of Dan.  They turned their faces,

        and said to Micah, What ails you, that you come with

        such a company?

018:024 He said, you have taken away my gods which I made, and the priest,

        and are gone away, and what have I more? and how then say

        you to me, What ails you?

018:025 The children of Dan said to him, "Don't let your voice be heard

        among us, lest angry fellows fall on you, and you lose your life,

        with the lives of your household."

018:026 The children of Dan went their way:  and when Micah saw

        that they were too strong for him, he turned and went back

        to his house.

018:027 They took that which Micah had made, and the priest whom

        he had, and came to Laish, to a people quiet and secure,

        and struck them with the edge of the sword; and they burnt

        the city with fire.

018:028 There was no deliverer, because it was far from Sidon,

        and they had no dealings with any man; and it was in

        the valley that lies by Beth Rehob.  They built the city,

        and lived therein.

018:029 They called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan

        their father, who was born to Israel:  however the name

        of the city was Laish at the first.

018:030 The children of Dan set up for themselves the engraved image:

        and Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Moses, he and his

        sons were priests to the tribe of the Danites until the day

        of the captivity of the land.

018:031 So they set them up Micah's engraved image which he made,

        all the time that the house of God was in Shiloh.

019:001 It happened in those days, when there was no king in Israel,

        that there was a certain Levite sojourning on the farther side

        of the hill country of Ephraim, who took to him a concubine

        out of Bethlehem Judah.

019:002 His concubine played the prostitute against him, and went

        away from him to her father's house to Bethlehem Judah,

        and was there the space of four months.

019:003 Her husband arose, and went after her, to speak kindly to her,

        to bring her again, having his servant with him, and a couple

        of donkeys:  and she brought him into her father's house;

        and when the father of the young lady saw him, he rejoiced

        to meet him.

019:004 His father-in-law, the young lady's father, retained him;

        and he abode with him three days:  so they ate and drink,

        and lodged there.

019:005 It happened on the fourth day, that they arose early in the morning,

        and he rose up to depart:  and the young lady's father said

        to his son-in-law, Strengthen your heart with a morsel of bread,

        and afterward you shall go your way.

019:006 So they sat down, ate, and drank, both of them together:

        and the young lady's father said to the man, Please be pleased

        to stay all night, and let your heart be merry.

019:007 The man rose up to depart; but his father-in-law urged him,

        and he lodged there again.

019:008 He arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart;

        and the young lady's father said, Please strengthen your heart

        and stay until the day declines; and they ate, both of them.

019:009 When the man rose up to depart, he, and his concubine,

        and his servant, his father-in-law, the young lady's father,

        said to him, Behold, now the day draws toward evening,

        please stay all night:  behold, the day grows to an end,

        lodge here, that your heart may be merry; and tomorrow get

        you early on your way, that you may go home.

019:010 But the man wouldn't stay that night, but he rose up and departed,

        and came over against Jebus (the same is Jerusalem):

        and there were with him a couple of donkeys saddled;

        his concubine also was with him.

019:011 When they were by Jebus, the day was far spent; and the servant

        said to his master, Please come and let us turn aside into

        this city of the Jebusites, and lodge in it.

019:012 His master said to him, We won't turn aside into the city

        of a foreigner, that is not of the children of Israel;

        but we will pass over to Gibeah.

019:013 He said to his servant, Come and let us draw near to one

        of these places; and we will lodge in Gibeah, or in Ramah.

019:014 So they passed on and went their way; and the sun went down

        on them near to Gibeah, which belongs to Benjamin.

019:015 They turned aside there, to go in to lodge in Gibeah:

        and he went in, and sat him down in the street of the city;

        for there was no man who took them into his house to lodge.

019:016 Behold, there came an old man from his work out of the field at even:

        now the man was of the hill country of Ephraim, and he sojourned

        in Gibeah; but the men of the place were Benjamites.

019:017 He lifted up his eyes, and saw the wayfaring man in the street

        of the city; and the old man said, Where go you? and

        whence come you?

019:018 He said to him, We are passing from Bethlehem Judah to the farther

        side of the hill country of Ephraim; from there am I, and I went

        to Bethlehem Judah:  and I am [now] going to the house of Yahweh;

        and there is no man who takes me into his house.

019:019 Yet there is both straw and provender for our donkeys;

        and there is bread and wine also for me, and for your handmaid,

        and for the young man who is with your servants:

        there is no want of anything.

019:020 The old man said, Peace be to you; howsoever let all your wants

        lie on me; only don't lodge in the street.

019:021 So he brought him into his house, and gave the donkeys fodder;

        and they washed their feet, and ate and drink.

019:022 As they were making their hearts merry, behold, the men of

        the city, certain base fellows, beset the house round about,

        beating at the door; and they spoke to the master of the house,

        the old man, saying, Bring forth the man who came into your house,

        that we may know him.

019:023 The man, the master of the house, went out to them, and said

        to them, No, my brothers, please don't act so wickedly;

        seeing that this man is come into my house, don't do this folly.

019:024 Behold, here is my daughter a virgin, and his concubine;

        them I will bring out now, and humble you them, and do

        with them what seems good to you:  but to this man don't

        do any such folly.

019:025 But the men wouldn't listen to him:  so the man laid hold

        on his concubine, and brought her forth to them; and they

        knew her, and abused her all the night until the morning:

        and when the day began to spring, they let her go.

019:026 Then came the woman in the dawning of the day, and fell

        down at the door of the man's house where her lord was,

        until it was light.

019:027 Her lord rose up in the morning, and opened the doors of

        the house, and went out to go his way; and behold, the woman

        his concubine was fallen down at the door of the house,

        with her hands on the threshold.

019:028 He said to her, Up, and let us be going; but none answered:

        then he took her up on the donkey; and the man rose up,

        and got him to his place.

019:029 When he was come into his house, he took a knife, and laid hold on

        his concubine, and divided her, limb by limb, into twelve pieces,

        and sent her throughout all the borders of Israel.

019:030 It was so, that all who saw it said, There was no such deed

        done nor seen from the day that the children of Israel came

        up out of the land of Egypt to this day:  consider it,

        take counsel, and speak.

020:001 Then all the children of Israel went out, and the congregation

        was assembled as one man, from Dan even to Beersheba,

        with the land of Gilead, to Yahweh at Mizpah.

020:002 The chiefs of all the people, even of all the tribes of Israel,

        presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God,

        four hundred thousand footmen who drew sword.

020:003 (Now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel

        had gone up to Mizpah.)  The children of Israel said, Tell us,

        how was this wickedness brought to pass?

020:004 The Levite, the husband of the woman who was murdered,

        answered, I came into Gibeah that belongs to Benjamin, I and

        my concubine, to lodge.

020:005 The men of Gibeah rose against me, and beset the house

        round about me by night; me they thought to have slain,

        and my concubine they forced, and she is dead.

020:006 I took my concubine, and cut her in pieces, and sent her

        throughout all the country of the inheritance of Israel;

        for they have committed lewdness and folly in Israel.

020:007 Behold, you children of Israel, all of you, give here your

        advice and counsel.

020:008 All the people arose as one man, saying, We will not any of us

        go to his tent, neither will we any of us turn to his house.

020:009 But now this is the thing which we will do to Gibeah:

        [we will go up] against it by lot;

020:010 and we will take ten men of one hundred throughout all

        the tribes of Israel, and one hundred of one thousand,

        and a thousand out of ten thousand, to get food for the people,

        that they may do, when they come to Gibeah of Benjamin,

        according to all the folly that they have worked in Israel.

020:011 So all the men of Israel were gathered against the city,

        knit together as one man.

020:012 The tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin,

        saying, What wickedness is this that is happen among you?

020:013 Now therefore deliver up the men, the base fellows, who are in Gibeah,

        that we may put them to death, and put away evil from Israel.

        But Benjamin would not listen to the voice of their brothers

        the children of Israel.

020:014 The children of Benjamin gathered themselves together

        out of the cities to Gibeah, to go out to battle against

        the children of Israel.

020:015 The children of Benjamin were numbered on that day out

        of the cities twenty-six thousand men who drew the sword,

        besides the inhabitants of Gibeah, who were numbered seven

        hundred chosen men.

020:016 Among all this people there were seven hundred chosen

        men left-handed; everyone could sling stones at a hair-breadth,

        and not miss.

020:017 The men of Israel, besides Benjamin, were numbered four hundred

        thousand men who drew sword:  all these were men of war.

020:018 The children of Israel arose, and went up to Bethel, and asked

        counsel of God; and they said, Who shall go up for us first

        to battle against the children of Benjamin?  Yahweh said,

        Judah [shall go up] first.

020:019 The children of Israel rose up in the morning,

        and encamped against Gibeah.

020:020 The men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin;

        and the men of Israel set the battle in array against

        them at Gibeah.

020:021 The children of Benjamin came forth out of Gibeah,

        and destroyed down to the ground of the Israelites on that day

        Twenty-two thousand men.

020:022 The people, the men of Israel, encouraged themselves,

        and set the battle again in array in the place where they

        set themselves in array the first day.

020:023 The children of Israel went up and wept before Yahweh until even;

        and they asked of Yahweh, saying, Shall I again draw near

        to battle against the children of Benjamin my brother?

        Yahweh said, Go up against him.

020:024 The children of Israel came near against the children of Benjamin

        the second day.

020:025 Benjamin went forth against them out of Gibeah the second day,

        and destroyed down to the ground of the children of Israel

        again eighteen thousand men; all these drew the sword.

020:026 Then all the children of Israel, and all the people, went up,

        and came to Bethel, and wept, and sat there before Yahweh,

        and fasted that day until even; and they offered burnt

        offerings and peace offerings before Yahweh.

020:027 The children of Israel asked of Yahweh (for the ark of the covenant

        of God was there in those days,

020:028 and Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood before

        it in those days), saying, Shall I yet again go out to battle

        against the children of Benjamin my brother, or shall I cease?

        Yahweh said, Go up; for tomorrow I will deliver him

        into your hand.

020:029 Israel set ambushes all around Gibeah.

020:030 The children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin

        on the third day, and set themselves in array against Gibeah,

        as at other times.

020:031 The children of Benjamin went out against the people,

        and were drawn away from the city; and they began to strike

        and kill of the people, as at other times, in the highways,

        of which one goes up to Bethel, and the other to Gibeah,

        in the field, about thirty men of Israel.

020:032 The children of Benjamin said, They are struck down before us,

        as at the first.  But the children of Israel said, Let us flee,

        and draw them away from the city to the highways.

020:033 All the men of Israel rose up out of their place, and set

        themselves in array at Baal Tamar:  and the ambushers of Israel

        broke forth out of their place, even out of Maareh Geba.

020:034 There came over against Gibeah ten thousand chosen men out

        of all Israel, and the battle was sore; but they didn't know

        that evil was close on them.

020:035 Yahweh struck Benjamin before Israel; and the children of Israel

        destroyed of Benjamin that day twenty-five thousand one hundred men:

        all these drew the sword.

020:036 So the children of Benjamin saw that they were struck;

        for the men of Israel gave place to Benjamin, because they

        trusted the ambushers whom they had set against Gibeah.

020:037 The ambushers hurried, and rushed on Gibeah; and the ambushers

        drew themselves along, and struck all the city with the edge

        of the sword.

020:038 Now the appointed sign between the men of Israel and the ambushers

        was that they should make a great cloud of smoke rise up

        out of the city.

020:039 The men of Israel turned in the battle, and Benjamin began

        to strike and kill of the men of Israel about thirty persons;

        for they said, Surely they are struck down before us,

        as in the first battle.

020:040 But when the cloud began to arise up out of the city in a pillar

        of smoke, the Benjamites looked behind them; and behold,

        the whole of the city went up in smoke to the sky.

020:041 The men of Israel turned, and the men of Benjamin were dismayed;

        for they saw that evil had come on them.

020:042 Therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel

        to the way of the wilderness; but the battle followed hard

        after them; and those who came out of the cities destroyed

        them in the midst of it.

020:043 They enclosed the Benjamites round about, [and] chased them,

        [and] trod them down at [their] resting place, as far as over

        against Gibeah toward the sunrise.

020:044 There fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand men; all these [were]

        men of valor.

020:045 They turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon:

        and they gleaned of them in the highways five thousand men,

        and followed hard after them to Gidom, and struck of them

        two thousand men.

020:046 So that all who fell that day of Benjamin were twenty-five

        thousand men who drew the sword; all these [were] men of valor.

020:047 But six hundred men turned and fled toward the wilderness to

        the rock of Rimmon, and abode in the rock of Rimmon four months.

020:048 The men of Israel turned again on the children of Benjamin,

        and struck them with the edge of the sword, both the

        entire city, and the livestock, and all that they found:

        moreover all the cities which they found they set on fire.

021:001 Now the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpah, saying, There shall

        not any of us give his daughter to Benjamin as wife.

021:002 The people came to Bethel, and sat there until evening before God,

        and lifted up their voices, and wept sore.

021:003 They said, Yahweh, the God of Israel, why has this happened in Israel,

        that there should be today one tribe lacking in Israel?

021:004 It happened on the next day that the people rose early,

        and built there an altar, and offered burnt offerings

        and peace offerings.

021:005 The children of Israel said, Who is there among all the tribes

        of Israel who didn't come up in the assembly to Yahweh?  For they

        had made a great oath concerning him who didn't come up

        to Yahweh to Mizpah, saying, He shall surely be put to death.

021:006 The children of Israel grieved for Benjamin their brother,

        and said, There is one tribe cut off from Israel this day.

021:007 How shall we do for wives for those who remain, seeing we

        have sworn by Yahweh that we will not give them of our

        daughters to wives?

021:008 They said, What one is there of the tribes of Israel who didn't

        come up to Yahweh to Mizpah?  Behold, there came none

        to the camp from Jabesh Gilead to the assembly.

021:009 For when the people were numbered, behold, there were none

        of the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead there.

021:010 The congregation sent there twelve thousand men of the most valiant,

        and commanded them, saying, Go and strike the inhabitants

        of Jabesh Gilead with the edge of the sword, with the women

        and the little ones.

021:011 This is the thing that you shall do:  you shall utterly destroy

        every male, and every woman who has lain by man.

021:012 They found among the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead four hundred

        young virgins, who had not known man by lying with him;

        and they brought them to the camp to Shiloh, which is in

        the land of Canaan.

021:013 The whole congregation sent and spoke to the children of Benjamin

        who were in the rock of Rimmon, and proclaimed peace to them.

021:014 Benjamin returned at that time; and they gave them the women

        whom they had saved alive of the women of Jabesh Gilead:

        and yet so they weren't enough for them.

021:015 The people grieved for Benjamin, because that Yahweh had made

        a breach in the tribes of Israel.

021:016 Then the elders of the congregation said, How shall we do for

        wives for those who remain, seeing the women are destroyed

        out of Benjamin?

021:017 They said, There must be an inheritance for those who are escaped

        of Benjamin, that a tribe not be blotted out from Israel.

021:018 However we may not give them wives of our daughters,

        for the children of Israel had sworn, saying, Cursed be

        he who gives a wife to Benjamin.

021:019 They said, Behold, there is a feast of Yahweh from year to year

        in Shiloh, which is on the north of Bethel, on the east

        side of the highway that goes up from Bethel to Shechem,

        and on the south of Lebonah.

021:020 They commanded the children of Benjamin, saying, Go and lie

        in wait in the vineyards,

021:021 and see, and behold, if the daughters of Shiloh come out

        to dance in the dances, then come you out of the vineyards,

        and catch you every man his wife of the daughters of Shiloh,

        and go to the land of Benjamin.

021:022 It shall be, when their fathers or their brothers come to complain

        to us, that we will say to them, Grant them graciously to us,

        because we didn't take for each man his wife in battle,

        neither did you give them to them, else would you now be guilty.

021:023 The children of Benjamin did so, and took them wives, according to

        their number, of those who danced, whom they carried off:

        and they went and returned to their inheritance, and built

        the cities, and lived in them.

021:024 The children of Israel departed there at that time, every man

        to his tribe and to his family, and they went out from there

        every man to his inheritance.

021:025 In those days there was no king in Israel:  every man did

        that which was right in his own eyes.

Book 08 Ruth

001:001 It happened in the days when the judges judged, that there

        was a famine in the land.  A certain man of Bethlehem Judah

        went to sojourn in the country of Moab, he, and his wife,

        and his two sons.

001:002 The name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife Naomi,

        and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of

        Bethlehem Judah.  They came into the country of Moab,

        and continued there.

001:003 Elimelech, Naomi's husband, died; and she was left,

        and her two sons.

001:004 They took them wives of the women of Moab; the name

        of the one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth:

        and they lived there about ten years.

001:005 Mahlon and Chilion died both of them; and the woman was left

        of her two children and of her husband.

001:006 Then she arose with her daughters-in-law, that she might return

        from the country of Moab:  for she had heard in the country of Moab

        how that Yahweh had visited his people in giving them bread.

001:007 She went forth out of the place where she was, and her two

        daughters-in-law with her; and they went on the way to return

        to the land of Judah.

001:008 Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, Go, return each

        of you to her mother's house:  Yahweh deal kindly with you,

        as you have dealt with the dead, and with me.

001:009 Yahweh grant you that you may find rest, each of you in the house

        of her husband.  Then she kissed them, and they lifted up

        their voice, and wept.

001:010 They said to her, No, but we will return with you to your people.

001:011 Naomi said, Turn again, my daughters:  why will you go with me?

        have I yet sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands?

001:012 Turn again, my daughters, go your way; for I am too old to have

        a husband.  If I should say, I have hope, if I should even

        have a husband tonight, and should also bear sons;

001:013 would you therefore wait until they were grown? would you

        therefore stay from having husbands? nay, my daughters,

        for it grieves me much for your sakes, for the hand of Yahweh

        is gone forth against me.

001:014 They lifted up their voice, and wept again:  and Orpah kissed

        her mother-in-law, but Ruth joined with her.

001:015 She said, Behold, your sister-in-law is gone back to her people,

        and to her god:  return you after your sister-in-law.

001:016 Ruth said, "Don't entreat me to leave you, and to return

        from following after you, for where you go, I will go;

        and where you lodge, I will lodge; your people shall be my people,

        and your God my God;

001:017 where you die, will I die, and there will I be buried:

        Yahweh do so to me, and more also, if anything but death part

        you and me."

001:018 When she saw that she was steadfastly minded to go with her,

        she left off speaking to her.

001:019 So they two went until they came to Bethlehem.  It happened,

        when they were come to Bethlehem, that all the city was moved

        about them, and [the women] said, Is this Naomi?

001:020 She said to them, "Don't call me Naomi, call me Mara;

        for the Almighty has dealt very bitterly with me.

001:021 I went out full, and Yahweh has brought me home again empty;

        why do you call me Naomi, seeing Yahweh has testified against me,

        and the Almighty has afflicted me?"

001:022 So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter-in-law,

        with her, who returned out of the country of Moab:

        and they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest.

002:001 Naomi had a kinsman of her husband's, a mighty man of wealth,

        of the family of Elimelech, and his name was Boaz.

002:002 Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi, Let me now go to the field,

        and glean among the ears of grain after him in whose sight

        I shall find favor.  She said to her, Go, my daughter.

002:003 She went, and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers:

        and she happened to come to the portion of the field belonging

        to Boaz, who was of the family of Elimelech.

002:004 Behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said to the reapers,

        Yahweh be with you.  They answered him, Yahweh bless you.

002:005 Then said Boaz to his servant who was set over the reapers,

        Whose young lady is this?

002:006 The servant who was set over the reapers answered, It is the Moabite

        lady who came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab:

002:007 She said, Please let me glean and gather after the reapers

        among the sheaves.  So she came, and has continued even

        from the morning until now, except that she stayed a little

        in the house.

002:008 Then said Boaz to Ruth, Don't you hear, my daughter?

        Don't go to glean in another field, neither pass from hence,

        but abide here fast by my maidens.

002:009 Let your eyes be on the field that they reap, and go after them:

        haven't I charged the young men that they shall not touch

        you? and when you are thirsty, go to the vessels, and drink

        of that which the young men have drawn.

002:010 Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground,

        and said to him, Why have I found favor in your sight,

        that you should take knowledge of me, seeing I am a foreigner?

002:011 Boaz answered her, It has fully been shown me, all that you

        have done to your mother-in-law since the death of your husband;

        and how you have left your father and your mother,

        and the land of your birth, and have come to a people that you

        didn't know before.

002:012 Yahweh recompense your work, and a full reward be given you

        of Yahweh, the God of Israel, under whose wings you are come

        to take refuge.

002:013 Then she said, Let me find favor in your sight, my lord,

        because you have comforted me, and because you have spoken kindly

        to your handmaid, though I am not as one of your handmaidens.

002:014 At meal time Boaz said to her, Come here, and eat of the bread,

        and dip your morsel in the vinegar.  She sat beside the reapers,

        and they reached her parched grain, and she ate, and was sufficed,

        and left of it.

002:015 When she was risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his

        young men, saying, Let her glean even among the sheaves,

        and don't reproach her.

002:016 Also pull out some for her from the bundles, and leave it,

        and let her glean, and don't rebuke her.

002:017 So she gleaned in the field until even; and she beat out that

        which she had gleaned, and it was about an ephah of barley.

002:018 She took it up, and went into the city; and her mother-in-law

        saw what she had gleaned:  and she brought forth and gave

        to her that which she had left after she was sufficed.

002:019 Her mother-in-law said to her, Where have you gleaned today? and

        where have you worked? blessed be he who did take knowledge of you.

        She shown her mother-in-law with whom she had worked, and said,

        The man's name with whom I worked today is Boaz.

002:020 Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, Blessed be he of Yahweh,

        who has not left off his kindness to the living and to the dead.

        Naomi said to her, The man is a close relative to us,

        one of our near kinsmen.

002:021 Ruth the Moabitess said, Yes, he said to me, You shall keep

        fast by my young men, until they have ended all my harvest.

002:022 Naomi said to Ruth her daughter-in-law, It is good, my daughter,

        that you go out with his maidens, and that they not meet you

        in any other field.

002:023 So she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz, to glean to the end

        of barley harvest and of wheat harvest; and she lived

        with her mother-in-law.

003:001 Naomi her mother-in-law said to her, My daughter, shall I

        not seek rest for you, that it may be well with you?

003:002 Now isn't Boaz our kinsman, with whose maidens you were?

        Behold, he winnows barley tonight in the threshing floor.

003:003 Wash yourself therefore, and anoint you, and put your clothing

        on you, and get you down to the threshing floor, but don't

        make yourself known to the man, until he shall have done

        eating and drinking.

003:004 It shall be, when he lies down, that you shall mark the place

        where he shall lie, and you shall go in, and uncover his feet,

        and lay you down; and he will tell you what you shall do.

003:005 She said to her, All that you say I will do.

003:006 She went down to the threshing floor, and did according to all

        that her mother-in-law told her.

003:007 When Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry,

        he went to lie down at the end of the heap of grain:

        and she came softly, and uncovered his feet, and laid her down.

003:008 It happened at midnight, that the man was afraid, and turned himself;

        and behold, a woman lay at his feet.

003:009 He said, Who are you?  She answered, I am Ruth your handmaid:

        spread therefore your skirt over your handmaid; for you are

        a near kinsman.

003:010 He said, Blessed are you by Yahweh, my daughter:

        you have shown more kindness in the latter end than at

        the beginning, inasmuch as you didn't follow young men,

        whether poor or rich.

003:011 Now, my daughter, don't be afraid; I will do to you all that

        you say; for all the city of my people does know that you

        are a worthy woman.

003:012 Now it is true that I am a near kinsman; however there is

        a kinsman nearer than I.

003:013 Stay this night, and it shall be in the morning, that if he will

        perform to you the part of a kinsman, well; let him do the

        kinsman's part:  but if he will not do the part of a kinsman to you,

        then will I do the part of a kinsman to you, as Yahweh lives:

        lie down until the morning.

003:014 She lay at his feet until the morning.  She rose up before

        one could discern another.  For he said, Let it not be known

        that the woman came to the threshing floor.

003:015 He said, Bring the mantle that is on you, and hold it;

        and she held it; and he measured six [measures] of barley,

        and laid it on her:  and he went into the city.

003:016 When she came to her mother-in-law, she said, Who are you,

        my daughter?  She told her all that the man had done to her.

003:017 She said, These six [measures] of barley gave he me; for he said,

        "Don't go empty to your mother-in-law."

003:018 Then said she, "Sit still, my daughter, until you know how

        the matter will fall; for the man will not rest, until he has

        finished the thing this day."

004:001 Now Boaz went up to the gate, and sat him down there:

        and behold, the near kinsman of whom Boaz spoke came by;

        to whom he said, Ho, such a one! turn aside, sit down here.

        He turned aside, and sat down.

004:002 He took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit you

        down here.  They sat down.

004:003 He said to the near kinsman, Naomi, who has come back out

        of the country of Moab, is selling the parcel of land,

        which was our brother Elimelech's:

004:004 I thought to disclose it to you, saying, Buy it before

        those who sit here, and before the elders of my people.

        If you will redeem it, redeem it:  but if you will not

        redeem it, then tell me, that I may know; for there

        is none to redeem it besides you; and I am after you.

        He said, I will redeem it.

004:005 Then said Boaz, What day you buy the field of the hand of Naomi,

        you must buy it also of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead,

        to raise up the name of the dead on his inheritance.

004:006 The near kinsman said, I can't redeem it for myself, lest I

        mar my own inheritance:  take my right of redemption on you;

        for I can't redeem it.

004:007 Now this was [the custom] in former time in Israel concerning

        redeeming and concerning exchanging, to confirm all things:

        a man drew off his shoe, and gave it to his neighbor;

        and this was the [manner of] attestation in Israel.

004:008 So the near kinsman said to Boaz, Buy it for yourself.

        He drew off his shoe.

004:009 Boaz said to the elders, and to all the people, You are witnesses

        this day, that I have bought all that was Elimelech's,

        and all that was Chilion's and Mahlon's, of the hand of Naomi.

004:010 Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I

        purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead

        on his inheritance, that the name of the dead not be cut off

        from among his brothers, and from the gate of his place:

        you are witnesses this day.

004:011 All the people who were in the gate, and the elders, said, We

        are witnesses.  Yahweh make the woman who has come into your house

        like Rachel and like Leah, which two built the house of Israel:

        and do you worthily in Ephrathah, and be famous in Bethlehem:

004:012 and let your house be like the house of Perez, whom Tamar

        bore to Judah, of the seed which Yahweh shall give you

        of this young woman.

004:013 So Boaz took Ruth, and she became his wife; and he went in to her,

        and Yahweh gave her conception, and she bore a son.

004:014 The women said to Naomi, Blessed be Yahweh, who has not left

        you this day without a near kinsman; and let his name be

        famous in Israel.

004:015 He shall be to you a restorer of life, and sustain you

        in your old age, for your daughter-in-law, who loves you,

        who is better to you than seven sons, has borne him.

004:016 Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became

        nurse to it.

004:017 The women her neighbors gave it a name, saying, There is a son

        born to Naomi; and they named him Obed:  he is the father

        of Jesse, the father of David.

004:018 Now this is the history of the generations of Perez:  Perez became

        the father of Hezron,

004:019 and Hezron became the father of Ram, and Ram became

        the father of Amminadab,

004:020 and Amminadab became the father of Nahshon, and Nahshon became

        the father of Salmon,

004:021 and Salmon became the father of Boaz, and Boaz became

        the father of Obed,

004:022 and Obed became the father of Jesse, and Jesse became

        the father of David.

Book 09 1 Samuel

001:001 Now there was a certain man of Ramathaim Zophim,

        of the hill country of Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah,

        the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu,

        the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite:

001:002 and he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah,

        and the name of other Peninnah:  and Peninnah had children,

        but Hannah had no children.

001:003 This man went up out of his city from year to year to worship

        and to sacrifice to Yahweh of Armies in Shiloh.  The two sons

        of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, priests to Yahweh, were there.

001:004 When the day came that Elkanah sacrificed, he gave to Peninnah

        his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions:

001:005 but to Hannah he gave a double portion; for he loved Hannah,

        but Yahweh had shut up her womb.

001:006 Her rival provoked her sore, to make her fret, because Yahweh

        had shut up her womb.

001:007 [as] he did so year by year, when she went up to the house

        of Yahweh, so she provoked her; therefore she wept,

        and did not eat.

001:008 Elkanah her husband said to her, Hannah, why weep you? and why

        don't you eat? and why is your heart grieved? am I not better

        to you than ten sons?

001:009 So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after

        they had drunk.  Now Eli the priest was sitting on his seat

        by the doorpost of the temple of Yahweh.

001:010 She was in bitterness of soul, and prayed to Yahweh,

        and wept sore.

001:011 She vowed a vow, and said, Yahweh of Armies, if you will indeed

        look on the affliction of your handmaid, and remember me,

        and not forget your handmaid, but will give to your handmaid

        a boy, then I will give him to Yahweh all the days of his life,

        and there shall no razor come on his head.

001:012 It happened, as she continued praying before Yahweh, that Eli

        marked her mouth.

001:013 Now Hannah, she spoke in her heart; only her lips moved,

        but her voice was not heard:  therefore Eli thought she

        had been drunken.

001:014 Eli said to her, How long will you be drunken? put away your

        wine from you.

001:015 Hannah answered, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit:

        I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but I poured

        out my soul before Yahweh.

001:016 Don't count your handmaid for a wicked woman; for out

        of the abundance of my complaint and my provocation have

        I spoken hitherto.

001:017 Then Eli answered, Go in peace; and the God of Israel grant

        your petition that you have asked of him.

001:018 She said, Let your handmaid find favor in your sight.

        So the woman went her way, and ate; and her facial expression

        wasn't sad any more.

001:019 They rose up in the morning early, and worshiped before Yahweh,

        and returned, and came to their house to Ramah:

        and Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and Yahweh remembered her.

001:020 It happened, when the time was come about, that Hannah conceived,

        and bore a son; and she named him Samuel, [saying], Because I

        have asked him of Yahweh.

001:021 The man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer to Yahweh

        the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.

001:022 But Hannah didn't go up; for she said to her husband, [I will not

        go up] until the child be weaned; and then I will bring him,

        that he may appear before Yahweh, and there abide forever.

001:023 Elkanah her husband said to her, Do what seems you good;

        wait until you have weaned him; only Yahweh establish his word.

        So the woman waited and nursed her son, until she weaned him.

001:024 When she had weaned him, she took him up with her,

        with three bulls, and one ephah of meal, and a bottle

        of wine, and brought him to the house of Yahweh in Shiloh:

        and the child was young.

001:025 They killed the bull, and brought the child to Eli.

001:026 She said, Oh, my lord, as your soul lives, my lord, I am

        the woman who stood by you here, praying to Yahweh.

001:027 For this child I prayed; and Yahweh has given me my petition

        which I asked of him:

001:028 therefore also I have granted him to Yahweh; as long as he lives

        he is granted to Yahweh.  He worshiped Yahweh there.

002:001 Hannah prayed, and said:  My heart exults in Yahweh!  My horn

        is exalted in Yahweh.  My mouth is enlarged over my enemies,

        because I rejoice in your salvation.

002:002 There is no one as holy as Yahweh, For there is no one besides you,

        nor is there any rock like our God.

002:003 Talk no more so exceeding proudly.  Don't let arrogance

        come out of your mouth, For Yahweh is a God of knowledge.

        By him actions are weighed.

002:004 The bows of the mighty men are broken.  Those who stumbled

        are girded with strength.

002:005 Those who were full have hired themselves out for bread.

        Those who were hungry have ceased [to hunger]. Yes, the barren

        has borne seven.  She who has many children languishes.

002:006 Yahweh kills, and makes alive.  He brings down to Sheol,

        and brings up.

002:007 Yahweh makes poor, and makes rich.  He brings low,

        he also lifts up.

002:008 He raises up the poor out of the dust.  He lifts up the needy

        from the dunghill, To make them sit with princes, and inherit

        the throne of glory, for the pillars of the earth are Yahweh's.

        He has set the world on them.

002:009 He will keep the feet of his holy ones, but the wicked shall be put

        to silence in darkness; for no man shall prevail by strength.

002:010 Those who strive with Yahweh shall be broken to pieces.

        He will thunder against them in the sky.  Yahweh will judge

        the ends of the earth.  He will give strength to his king,

        and exalt the horn of his anointed.

002:011 Elkanah went to Ramah to his house.  The child did minister

        to Yahweh before Eli the priest.

002:012 Now the sons of Eli were base men; they didn't know Yahweh.

002:013 The custom of the priests with the people was that when any man

        offered sacrifice, the priest's servant came, while the flesh

        was boiling, with a fork of three teeth in his hand;

002:014 and he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot;

        all that the fork brought up the priest took therewith.

        So they did in Shiloh to all the Israelites who came there.

002:015 Yes, before they burnt the fat, the priest's servant came, and said

        to the man who sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest;

        for he will not have boiled flesh of you, but raw.

002:016 If the man said to him, They will surely burn the fat first,

        and then take as much as your soul desires; then he would say,

        No, but you shall give it me now:  and if not, I will take

        it by force.

002:017 The sin of the young men was very great before Yahweh;

        for the men despised the offering of Yahweh.

002:018 But Samuel ministered before Yahweh, being a child,

        girded with a linen ephod.

002:019 Moreover his mother made him a little robe, and brought it

        to him from year to year, when she came up with her husband

        to offer the yearly sacrifice.

002:020 Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, Yahweh give you seed

        of this woman for the petition which was asked of Yahweh.

        They went to their own home.

002:021 Yahweh visited Hannah, and she conceived, and bore three sons

        and two daughters.  The child Samuel grew before Yahweh.

002:022 Now Eli was very old; and he heard all that his sons did

        to all Israel, and how that they lay with the women who served

        at the door of the tent of meeting.

002:023 He said to them, Why do you such things? for I hear of your

        evil dealings from all this people.

002:024 No, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear:

        you make Yahweh's people to disobey.

002:025 If one man sin against another, God shall judge him;

        but if a man sin against Yahweh, who shall entreat for him?

        Notwithstanding, they didn't listen to the voice of their father,

        because Yahweh was minded to kill them.

002:026 The child Samuel grew on, and increased in favor both with Yahweh,

        and also with men.

002:027 There came a man of God to Eli, and said to him, Thus says

        Yahweh, Did I reveal myself to the house of your father,

        when they were in Egypt [in bondage] to Pharaoh's house?

002:028 and did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be

        my priest, to go up to my altar, to burn incense, to wear

        an ephod before me? and did I give to the house of your father

        all the offerings of the children of Israel made by fire?

002:029 Why kick you at my sacrifice and at my offering, which I have

        commanded in [my] habitation, and honor your sons above me,

        to make yourselves fat with the best of all the offerings

        of Israel my people?

002:030 Therefore Yahweh, the God of Israel, says, I said indeed

        that your house, and the house of your father, should walk

        before me forever:  but now Yahweh says, Be it far from me;

        for those who honor me I will honor, and those who despise

        me shall be lightly esteemed.

002:031 Behold, the days come, that I will cut off your arm, and the arm

        of your father's house, that there shall not be an old man

        in your house.

002:032 You shall see the affliction of [my] habitation, in all the wealth

        which [God] shall give Israel; and there shall not be an old

        man in your house forever.

002:033 The man of yours, [whom] I shall not cut off from my altar,

        [shall be] to consume your eyes, and to grieve your heart;

        and all the increase of your house shall die in the flower

        of their age.

002:034 This shall be the sign to you, that shall come on your two sons,

        on Hophni and Phinehas:  in one day they shall die both of them.

002:035 I will raise me up a faithful priest, that shall do

        according to that which is in my heart and in my mind:

        and I will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before

        my anointed forever.

002:036 It shall happen, that everyone who is left in your house shall

        come and bow down to him for a piece of silver and a loaf

        of bread, and shall say, Please put me into one of the priests'

        offices, that I may eat a morsel of bread.

003:001 The child Samuel ministered to Yahweh before Eli.

        The word of Yahweh was precious in those days; there was

        no frequent vision.

003:002 It happened at that time, when Eli was laid down in his place

        (now his eyes had begun to grow dim, so that he could not see),

003:003 and the lamp of God hadn't yet gone out, and Samuel had laid

        down [to sleep], in the temple of Yahweh, where the ark

        of God was;

003:004 that Yahweh called Samuel; and he said, Here am I.

003:005 He ran to Eli, and said, Here am I; for you called me.

        He said, I didn't call; lie down again.  He went and lay down.

003:006 Yahweh called yet again, Samuel.  Samuel arose and went to Eli,

        and said, Here am I; for you called me.  He answered,

        I didn't call, my son; lie down again.

003:007 Now Samuel didn't yet know Yahweh, neither was the word

        of Yahweh yet revealed to him.

003:008 Yahweh called Samuel again the third time.  He arose

        and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for you called me.

        Eli perceived that Yahweh had called the child.

003:009 Therefore Eli said to Samuel, Go, lie down:  and it shall be,

        if he call you, that you shall say, Speak, Yahweh; for your

        servant hears.  So Samuel went and lay down in his place.

003:010 Yahweh came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel.

        Then Samuel said, Speak; for your servant hears.

003:011 Yahweh said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel,

        at which both the ears of everyone who hears it shall tingle.

003:012 In that day I will perform against Eli all that I have spoken

        concerning his house, from the beginning even to the end.

003:013 For I have told him that I will judge his house forever,

        for the iniquity which he knew, because his sons did bring

        a curse on themselves, and he didn't restrain them.

003:014 Therefore I have sworn to the house of Eli, that the iniquity

        of Eli's house shall not be expiated with sacrifice

        nor offering forever.

003:015 Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house

        of Yahweh.  Samuel feared to show Eli the vision.

003:016 Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son.

        He said, Here am I.

003:017 He said, "What is the thing that [Yahweh] has spoken to you?

        Please don't hide it from me.  God do so to you, and more also,

        if you hide anything from me of all the things that he

        spoke to you."

003:018 Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him.

        He said, It is Yahweh:  let him do what seems him good.

003:019 Samuel grew, and Yahweh was with him, and did let none of his

        words fall to the ground.

003:020 All Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel was

        established to be a prophet of Yahweh.

003:021 Yahweh appeared again in Shiloh; for Yahweh revealed himself

        to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of Yahweh.

004:001 The word of Samuel came to all Israel.  Now Israel went out

        against the Philistines to battle, and encamped beside Ebenezer:

        and the Philistines encamped in Aphek.

004:002 The Philistines put themselves in array against Israel:

        and when they joined battle, Israel was struck before

        the Philistines; and they killed of the army in the field

        about four thousand men.

004:003 When the people were come into the camp, the elders of Israel said,

        Why has Yahweh struck us today before the Philistines?  Let us

        get the ark of the covenant of Yahweh out of Shiloh to us,

        that it may come among us, and save us out of the hand

        of our enemies.

004:004 So the people sent to Shiloh; and they brought from there the ark

        of the covenant of Yahweh of Armies, who sits [above] the cherubim:

        and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there

        with the ark of the covenant of God.

004:005 When the ark of the covenant of Yahweh came into the camp,

        all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth rang again.

004:006 When the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said,

        What means the noise of this great shout in the camp of

        the Hebrews?  They understood that the ark of Yahweh was come

        into the camp.

004:007 The Philistines were afraid, for they said, God is come

        into the camp.  They said, Woe to us! for there has not been

        such a thing heretofore.

004:008 Woe to us! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty

        gods? these are the gods that struck the Egyptians with all

        manner of plagues in the wilderness.

004:009 Be strong, and behave yourselves like men, O you Philistines,

        that you not be servants to the Hebrews, as they have been to you:

        quit yourselves like men, and fight.

004:010 The Philistines fought, and Israel was struck, and they fled

        every man to his tent:  and there was a very great slaughter;

        for there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen.

004:011 The ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni

        and Phinehas, were slain.

004:012 There ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to Shiloh

        the same day, with his clothes torn, and with earth on his head.

004:013 When he came, behold, Eli was sitting on his seat by the

        road watching; for his heart trembled for the ark of God.

        When the man came into the city, and told it, all the

        city cried out.

004:014 When Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, What means

        the noise of this tumult?  The man hurried, and came

        and told Eli.

004:015 Now Eli was ninety-eight years old; and his eyes were set,

        so that he could not see.

004:016 The man said to Eli, I am he who came out of the army, and I fled

        today out of the army.  He said, How went the matter, my son?

004:017 He who brought the news answered, Israel is fled before

        the Philistines, and there has been also a great slaughter

        among the people, and your two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas,

        are dead, and the ark of God is taken.

004:018 It happened, when he made mention of the ark of God, that [Eli]

        fell from off his seat backward by the side of the gate;

        and his neck broke, and he died:  for he was an old man, and heavy.

        He had judged Israel forty years.

004:019 His daughter-in-law, Phinehas' wife, was with child,

        near to be delivered:  and when she heard the news that

        the ark of God was taken, and that her father-in-law and her

        husband were dead, she bowed herself and brought forth;

        for her pains came on her.

004:020 About the time of her death the women who stood by her said

        to her, Don't be afraid; for you have brought forth a son.

        But she didn't answer, neither did she regard it.

004:021 She named the child Ichabod, saying, The glory is departed

        from Israel; because the ark of God was taken, and because

        of her father-in-law and her husband.

004:022 She said, The glory is departed from Israel; for the ark

        of God is taken.

005:001 Now the Philistines had taken the ark of God, and they brought

        it from Ebenezer to Ashdod.

005:002 The Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it into

        the house of Dagon, and set it by Dagon.

005:003 When they of Ashdod arose early on the next day, behold, Dagon was

        fallen on his face to the ground before the ark of Yahweh.

        They took Dagon, and set him in his place again.

005:004 When they arose early on the next day morning, behold, Dagon was

        fallen on his face to the ground before the ark of Yahweh;

        and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands [lay]

        cut off on the threshold; only [the stump of] Dagon was

        left to him.

005:005 Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any who come into

        Dagon's house, tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod,

        to this day.

005:006 But the hand of Yahweh was heavy on them of Ashdod,

        and he destroyed them, and struck them with tumors, even Ashdod

        and the borders of it.

005:007 When the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said,

        The ark of the God of Israel shall not abide with us;

        for his hand is sore on us, and on Dagon our god.

005:008 They sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the Philistines

        to them, and said, What shall we do with the ark of the God

        of Israel?  They answered, Let the ark of the God of Israel

        be carried about to Gath.  They carried the ark of the God

        of Israel [there].

005:009 It was so, that after they had carried it about, the hand

        of Yahweh was against the city with a very great confusion:

        and he struck the men of the city, both small and great;

        and tumors broke out on them.

005:010 So they sent the ark of God to Ekron.  It happened, as the ark

        of God came to Ekron, that the Ekronites cried out, saying,

        They have brought about the ark of the God of Israel to us,

        to kill us and our people.

005:011 They sent therefore and gathered together all the lords of

        the Philistines, and they said, Send away the ark of the God

        of Israel, and let it go again to its own place, that it

        not kill us and our people.  For there was a deadly confusion

        throughout all the city; the hand of God was very heavy there.

005:012 The men who didn't die were struck with the tumors;

        and the cry of the city went up to heaven.

006:001 The ark of Yahweh was in the country of the Philistines seven months.

006:002 The Philistines called for the priests and the diviners,

        saying, "What shall we do with the ark of Yahweh?  Show us

        with which we shall send it to its place."

006:003 They said, "If you send away the ark of the God of Israel, don't send

        it empty; but by all means return him a trespass offering:

        then you shall be healed, and it shall be known to you why

        his hand is not removed from you."

006:004 Then they said, "What shall be the trespass offering which we

        shall return to him?"  They said, "Five golden tumors,

        and five golden mice, [according to] the number of the lords

        of the Philistines; for one plague was on you all,

        and on your lords.

006:005 Therefore you shall make images of your tumors, and images of your

        mice that mar the land; and you shall give glory to the God

        of Israel:  peradventure he will lighten his hand from off you,

        and from off your gods, and from off your land.

006:006 Why then do you harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and Pharaoh

        hardened their hearts?  When he had worked wonderfully among them,

        didn't they let the people go, and they departed?

006:007 Now therefore take and prepare yourselves a new cart,

        and two milk cows, on which there has come no yoke; and tie

        the cows to the cart, and bring their calves home from them;

006:008 and take the ark of Yahweh, and lay it on the cart; and put

        the jewels of gold, which you return him for a trespass offering,

        in a coffer by the side of it; and send it away, that it may go.

006:009 Behold; if it goes up by the way of its own border to

        Beth Shemesh, then he has done us this great evil:  but if not,

        then we shall know that it is not his hand that struck us;

        it was a chance that happened to us."

006:010 The men did so, and took two milk cows, and tied them to the cart,

        and shut up their calves at home;

006:011 and they put the ark of Yahweh on the cart, and the coffer

        with the mice of gold and the images of their tumors.

006:012 The cows took the straight way by the way to Beth Shemesh;

        they went along the highway, lowing as they went,

        and didn't turn aside to the right hand or to the left;

        and the lords of the Philistines went after them to the border

        of Beth Shemesh.

006:013 They of Beth Shemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley;

        and they lifted up their eyes, and saw the ark, and rejoiced

        to see it.

006:014 The cart came into the field of Joshua of Beth Shemesh,

        and stood there, where there was a great stone:

        and they split the wood of the cart, and offered up the cows

        for a burnt offering to Yahweh.

006:015 The Levites took down the ark of Yahweh, and the coffer that

        was with it, in which the jewels of gold were, and put them

        on the great stone:  and the men of Beth Shemesh offered burnt

        offerings and sacrificed sacrifices the same day to Yahweh.

006:016 When the five lords of the Philistines had seen it, they returned

        to Ekron the same day.

006:017 These are the golden tumors which the Philistines returned for

        a trespass offering to Yahweh:  for Ashdod one, for Gaza one,

        for Ashkelon one, for Gath one, for Ekron one;

006:018 and the golden mice, according to the number of all the cities

        of the Philistines belonging to the five lords, both of fortified

        cities and of country villages, even to the great stone,

        whereon they set down the ark of Yahweh, [which stone remains]

        to this day in the field of Joshua of Beth Shemesh.

006:019 He struck of the men of Beth Shemesh, because they had looked

        into the ark of Yahweh, he struck of the people fifty thousand

        seventy men; and the people mourned, because Yahweh had struck

        the people with a great slaughter.

006:020 The men of Beth Shemesh said, Who is able to stand before Yahweh,

        this holy God? and to whom shall he go up from us?

006:021 They sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kiriath Jearim,

        saying, The Philistines have brought back the ark of Yahweh;

        come you down, and bring it up to you.

007:001 The men of Kiriath Jearim came, and fetched up the ark of Yahweh,

        and brought it into the house of Abinadab in the hill,

        and sanctified Eleazar his son to keep the ark of Yahweh.

007:002 It happened, from the day that the ark abode in Kiriath Jearim,

        that the time was long; for it was twenty years:

        and all the house of Israel lamented after Yahweh.

007:003 Samuel spoke to all the house of Israel, saying, If you

        do return to Yahweh with all your heart, then put away

        the foreign gods and the Ashtaroth from among you,

        and direct your hearts to Yahweh, and serve him only;

        and he will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines.

007:004 Then the children of Israel did put away the Baals and the Ashtaroth,

        and served Yahweh only.

007:005 Samuel said, "Gather all Israel to Mizpah, and I will pray

        for you to Yahweh."

007:006 They gathered together to Mizpah, and drew water, and poured

        it out before Yahweh, and fasted on that day, and said there,

        "We have sinned against Yahweh."  Samuel judged the children

        of Israel in Mizpah.

007:007 When the Philistines heard that the children of Israel were

        gathered together at Mizpah, the lords of the Philistines went

        up against Israel.  When the children of Israel heard it,

        they were afraid of the Philistines.

007:008 The children of Israel said to Samuel, "Don't cease to cry

        to Yahweh our God for us, that he will save us out of the hand

        of the Philistines."

007:009 Samuel took a sucking lamb, and offered it for a whole burnt

        offering to Yahweh:  and Samuel cried to Yahweh for Israel;

        and Yahweh answered him.

007:010 As Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Philistines

        drew near to battle against Israel; but Yahweh thundered with a

        great thunder on that day on the Philistines, and confused them;

        and they were struck down before Israel.

007:011 The men of Israel went out of Mizpah, and pursued the Philistines,

        and struck them, until they came under Beth Kar.

007:012 Then Samuel took a stone, and set it between Mizpah and Shen,

        and called the name of it Ebenezer, saying, Hitherto has

        Yahweh helped us.

007:013 So the Philistines were subdued, and they came no more within

        the border of Israel:  and the hand of Yahweh was against

        the Philistines all the days of Samuel.

007:014 The cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were

        restored to Israel, from Ekron even to Gath; and the border

        of it did Israel deliver out of the hand of the Philistines.

        There was peace between Israel and the Amorites.

007:015 Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.

007:016 He went from year to year in circuit to Bethel and Gilgal,

        and Mizpah; and he judged Israel in all those places.

007:017 His return was to Ramah, for there was his house; and there

        he judged Israel:  and he built there an altar to Yahweh.

008:001 It happened, when Samuel was old, that he made his sons

        judges over Israel.

008:002 Now the name of his firstborn was Joel; and the name of

        his second, Abijah:  they were judges in Beersheba.

008:003 His sons didn't walk in his ways, but turned aside after lucre,

        and took bribes, and perverted justice.

008:004 Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together,

        and came to Samuel to Ramah;

008:005 and they said to him, Behold, you are old, and your sons

        don't walk in your ways:  now make us a king to judge us

        like all the nations.

008:006 But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, Give us a king

        to judge us.  Samuel prayed to Yahweh.

008:007 Yahweh said to Samuel, Listen to the voice of the people

        in all that they tell you; for they have not rejected you,

        but they have rejected me, that I should not be king over them.

008:008 According to all the works which they have done since the day

        that I brought them up out of Egypt even to this day,

        in that they have forsaken me, and served other gods,

        so do they also to you.

008:009 Now therefore listen to their voice:  however you shall protest

        solemnly to them, and shall show them the manner of the king

        who shall reign over them.

008:010 Samuel told all the words of Yahweh to the people who asked

        of him a king.

008:011 He said, This will be the manner of the king who shall reign

        over you:  he will take your sons, and appoint them to him,

        for his chariots, and to be his horsemen; and they shall run

        before his chariots;

008:012 and he will appoint them to him for captains of thousands,

        and captains of fifties; and [he will set some] to plow his ground,

        and to reap his harvest, and to make his instruments of war,

        and the instruments of his chariots.

008:013 He will take your daughters to be perfumers, and to be cooks,

        and to be bakers.

008:014 He will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your olive groves,

        even the best of them, and give them to his servants.

008:015 He will take the tenth of your seed, and of your vineyards,

        and give to his officers, and to his servants.

008:016 He will take your male servants, and your female servants,

        and your best young men, and your donkeys, and put them

        to his work.

008:017 He will take the tenth of your flocks:  and you shall

        be his servants.

008:018 You shall cry out in that day because of your king whom you shall

        have chosen you; and Yahweh will not answer you in that day.

008:019 But the people refused to listen to the voice of Samuel;

        and they said, No:  but we will have a king over us,

008:020 that we also may be like all the nations, and that our king

        may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles.

008:021 Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed

        them in the ears of Yahweh.

008:022 Yahweh said to Samuel, Listen to their voice, and make them a king.

        Samuel said to the men of Israel, Go you every man to his city.

009:001 Now there was a man of Benjamin, whose name was Kish, the son

        of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Becorath, the son

        of Aphiah, the son of a Benjamite, a mighty man of valor.

009:002 He had a son, whose name was Saul, an impressive young man;

        and there was not among the children of Israel a better

        person than he.  From his shoulders and upward he was higher

        than any of the people.

009:003 The donkeys of Kish, Saul's father, were lost.  Kish said

        to Saul his son, Take now one of the servants with you,

        and arise, go seek the donkeys.

009:004 He passed through the hill country of Ephraim, and passed

        through the land of Shalishah, but they didn't find them:

        then they passed through the land of Shaalim, and there they

        weren't there:  and he passed through the land of the Benjamites,

        but they didn't find them.

009:005 When they had come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant

        who was with him, Come, and let us return, lest my father

        leave off caring for the donkeys, and be anxious for us.

009:006 He said to him, See now, there is in this city a man of God,

        and he is a man who is held in honor; all that he says comes

        surely to pass:  now let us go there; peradventure he can

        tell us concerning our journey whereon we go.

009:007 Then said Saul to his servant, But, behold, if we go, what shall

        we bring the man? for the bread is spent in our vessels,

        and there is not a present to bring to the man of God:

        what have we?

009:008 The servant answered Saul again, and said, Behold, I have

        in my hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver:

        that will I give to the man of God, to tell us our way.

009:009 (In earlier times in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God,

        thus he said, Come, and let us go to the seer; for he who is

        now called a Prophet was before called a Seer.)

009:010 Then said Saul to his servant, Well said; come, let us go.

        So they went to the city where the man of God was.

009:011 As they went up the ascent to the city, they found young maidens

        going out to draw water, and said to them, Is the seer here?

009:012 They answered them, and said, He is; behold, [he is] before you:

        make haste now, for he is come today into the city;

        for the people have a sacrifice today in the high place:

009:013 as soon as you are come into the city, you shall immediately

        find him, before he goes up to the high place to eat;

        for the people will not eat until he come, because he does bless

        the sacrifice; [and] afterwards they eat who are invited.

        Now therefore get you up; for at this time you shall find him.

009:014 They went up to the city; [and] as they came within the city,

        behold, Samuel came out toward them, to go up to the high place.

009:015 Now Yahweh had revealed to Samuel a day before Saul came, saying,

009:016 Tomorrow about this time I will send you a man out of the land

        of Benjamin, and you shall anoint him to be prince over my

        people Israel; and he shall save my people out of the hand

        of the Philistines:  for I have looked on my people,

        because their cry is come to me.

009:017 When Samuel saw Saul, Yahweh said to him, Behold, the man

        of whom I spoke to you! this same shall have authority

        over my people.

009:018 Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said,

        Tell me, Please, where the seer's house is.

009:019 Samuel answered Saul, and said, I am the seer; go up before

        me to the high place, for you shall eat with me today:

        and in the morning I will let you go, and will tell you all

        that is in your heart.

009:020 As for your donkeys who were lost three days ago,

        don't set your mind on them; for they are found.

        For whom is all that is desirable in Israel?  Is it not for you,

        and for all your father's house?

009:021 Saul answered, Am I not a Benjamite, of the smallest

        of the tribes of Israel? and my family the least of all

        the families of the tribe of Benjamin? why then speak you

        to me after this manner?

009:022 Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into

        the guest room, and made them sit in the best place among

        those who were invited, who were about thirty persons.

009:023 Samuel said to the cook, Bring the portion which I gave you,

        of which I said to you, Set it by you.

009:024 The cook took up the thigh, and that which was on it, and set it

        before Saul.  [Samuel] said, Behold, that which has been reserved!

        set it before you and eat; because to the appointed time has

        it been kept for you, for I said, I have invited the people.

        So Saul ate with Samuel that day.

009:025 When they were come down from the high place into the city,

        he talked with Saul on the housetop.

009:026 They arose early:  and it happened about the spring of the day,

        that Samuel called to Saul on the housetop, saying, Up, that I

        may send you away.  Saul arose, and they went out both of them,

        he and Samuel, abroad.

009:027 As they were going down at the end of the city, Samuel said

        to Saul, Bid the servant pass on before us (and he passed on),

        but stand you still first, that I may cause you to hear

        the word of God.

010:001 Then Samuel took the vial of oil, and poured it on his head,

        and kissed him, and said, Isn't it that Yahweh has anointed

        you to be prince over his inheritance?

010:002 When you are departed from me today, then you shall find two men

        by Rachel's tomb, in the border of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they

        will tell you, The donkeys which you went to seek are found;

        and behold, your father has left off caring for the donkeys,

        and is anxious for you, saying, What shall I do for my son?

010:003 Then shall you go on forward from there, and you shall

        come to the oak of Tabor; and there shall meet you there

        three men going up to God to Bethel, one carrying three kids,

        and another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying

        a bottle of wine:

010:004 and they will greet you, and give you two loaves of bread,

        which you shall receive of their hand.

010:005 After that you shall come to the hill of God, where is

        the garrison of the Philistines:  and it shall happen,

        when you are come there to the city, that you shall meet a band

        of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery,

        and a tambourine, and a pipe, and a harp, before them;

        and they will be prophesying:

010:006 and the Spirit of Yahweh will come mightily on you, and you shall

        prophesy with them, and shall be turned into another man.

010:007 Let it be, when these signs are come to you, that you do

        as occasion shall serve you; for God is with you.

010:008 You shall go down before me to Gilgal; and behold, I will come

        down to you, to offer burnt offerings, and to sacrifice

        sacrifices of peace offerings:  seven days shall you wait,

        until I come to you, and show you what you shall do.

010:009 It was so, that when he had turned his back to go

        from Samuel, God gave him another heart:  and all those signs

        happened that day.

010:010 When they came there to the hill, behold, a band of prophets

        met him; and the Spirit of God came mightily on him,

        and he prophesied among them.

010:011 It happened, when all who knew him before saw that, behold,

        he prophesied with the prophets, then the people said one

        to another, What is this that is come to the son of Kish?  Is Saul

        also among the prophets?

010:012 One of the same place answered, Who is their father?

        Therefore it became a proverb, Is Saul also among the prophets?

010:013 When he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the high place.

010:014 Saul's uncle said to him and to his servant, Where went you?

        He said, To seek the donkeys; and when we saw that they

        were not found, we came to Samuel.

010:015 Saul's uncle said, Tell me, Please, what Samuel said to you.

010:016 Saul said to his uncle, He told us plainly that the donkeys

        were found.  But concerning the matter of the kingdom,

        of which Samuel spoke, he didn't tell him.

010:017 Samuel called the people together to Yahweh to Mizpah;

010:018 and he said to the children of Israel, Thus says Yahweh,

        the God of Israel, I brought up Israel out of Egypt,

        and I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians,

        and out of the hand of all the kingdoms that oppressed you:

010:019 but you have this day rejected your God, who himself saves

        you out of all your calamities and your distresses;

        and you have said to him, [No], but set a king over us.

        Now therefore present yourselves before Yahweh by your tribes,

        and by your thousands.

010:020 So Samuel brought all the tribes of Israel near, and the tribe

        of Benjamin was taken.

010:021 He brought the tribe of Benjamin near by their families;

        and the family of the Matrites was taken; and Saul the son

        of Kish was taken:  but when they sought him, he could

        not be found.

010:022 Therefore they asked of Yahweh further, Is there yet a man

        to come here?  Yahweh answered, Behold, he has hid himself

        among the baggage.

010:023 They ran and fetched him there; and when he stood among

        the people, he was higher than any of the people from his

        shoulders and upward.

010:024 Samuel said to all the people, "You see him whom Yahweh

        has chosen, that there is none like him among all the people?"

        All the people shouted, and said, [Long] live the king.

010:025 Then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom,

        and wrote it in a book, and laid it up before Yahweh.

        Samuel sent all the people away, every man to his house.

010:026 Saul also went to his house to Gibeah; and there went with him

        the army, whose hearts God had touched.

010:027 But certain worthless fellows said, How shall this man save us?

        They despised him, and brought him no present.

        But he held his peace.

011:001 Then Nahash the Ammonite came up, and encamped against Jabesh Gilead:

        and all the men of Jabesh said to Nahash, Make a covenant

        with us, and we will serve you.

011:002 Nahash the Ammonite said to them, On this condition will I

        make it with you, that all your right eyes be put out;

        and I will lay it for a reproach on all Israel.

011:003 The elders of Jabesh said to him, Give us seven days' respite, that we

        may send messengers to all the borders of Israel; and then,

        if there be none to save us, we will come out to you.

011:004 Then came the messengers to Gibeah of Saul, and spoke these

        words in the ears of the people:  and all the people lifted

        up their voice, and wept.

011:005 Behold, Saul came following the oxen out of the field;

        and Saul said, What ails the people that they weep?

        They told him the words of the men of Jabesh.

011:006 The Spirit of God came mightily on Saul when he heard those words,

        and his anger was kindled greatly.

011:007 He took a yoke of oxen, and cut them in pieces, and sent

        them throughout all the borders of Israel by the hand

        of messengers, saying, Whoever doesn't come forth after

        Saul and after Samuel, so shall it be done to his oxen.

        The dread of Yahweh fell on the people, and they came out

        as one man.

011:008 He numbered them in Bezek; and the children of Israel were

        three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand.

011:009 They said to the messengers who came, Thus shall you tell

        the men of Jabesh Gilead, Tomorrow, by the time the sun is hot,

        you shall have deliverance.  The messengers came and told

        the men of Jabesh; and they were glad.

011:010 Therefore the men of Jabesh said, Tomorrow we will come out to you,

        and you shall do with us all that seems good to you.

011:011 It was so on the next day, that Saul put the people in

        three companies; and they came into the midst of the camp in the

        morning watch, and struck the Ammonites until the heat of the day:

        and it happened, that those who remained were scattered,

        so that no two of them were left together.

011:012 The people said to Samuel, Who is he who said, Shall Saul reign

        over us? bring the men, that we may put them to death.

011:013 Saul said, There shall not a man be put to death this day;

        for today Yahweh has worked deliverance in Israel.

011:014 Then said Samuel to the people, Come, and let us go to Gilgal,

        and renew the kingdom there.

011:015 All the people went to Gilgal; and there they made Saul king

        before Yahweh in Gilgal; and there they offered sacrifices

        of peace offerings before Yahweh; and there Saul and all

        the men of Israel rejoiced greatly.

012:001 Samuel said to all Israel, Behold, I have listened to your voice

        in all that you said to me, and have made a king over you.

012:002 Now, behold, the king walks before you; and I am old

        and gray-headed; and behold, my sons are with you:

        and I have walked before you from my youth to this day.

012:003 Here I am:  witness against me before Yahweh, and before

        his anointed:  whose ox have I taken? or whose donkey have I

        taken? or whom have I defrauded? whom have I oppressed?

        or of whose hand have I taken a ransom to blind my eyes

        therewith? and I will restore it you.

012:004 They said, You have not defrauded us, nor oppressed us,

        neither have you taken anything of any man's hand.

012:005 He said to them, Yahweh is witness against you, and his anointed

        is witness this day, that you have not found anything in my hand.

        They said, He is witness.

012:006 Samuel said to the people, It is Yahweh who appointed Moses and Aaron,

        and that brought your fathers up out of the land of Egypt.

012:007 Now therefore stand still, that I may plead with you

        before Yahweh concerning all the righteous acts of Yahweh,

        which he did to you and to your fathers.

012:008 When Jacob was come into Egypt, and your fathers cried to Yahweh,

        then Yahweh sent Moses and Aaron, who brought forth your

        fathers out of Egypt, and made them to dwell in this place.

012:009 But they forgot Yahweh their God; and he sold them into the hand

        of Sisera, captain of the army of Hazor, and into the hand

        of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of Moab;

        and they fought against them.

012:010 They cried to Yahweh, and said, We have sinned, because we have

        forsaken Yahweh, and have served the Baals and the Ashtaroth:

        but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies, and we

        will serve you.

012:011 Yahweh sent Jerubbaal, and Bedan, and Jephthah, and Samuel,

        and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on every side;

        and you lived in safety.

012:012 When you saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon came

        against you, you said to me, No, but a king shall reign over us;

        when Yahweh your God was your king.

012:013 Now therefore see the king whom you have chosen, and whom you

        have asked for:  and behold, Yahweh has set a king over you.

012:014 If you will fear Yahweh, and serve him, and listen to his voice,

        and not rebel against the commandment of Yahweh, and both you

        and also the king who reigns over you are followers of Yahweh

        your God, [well]:

012:015 but if you will not listen to the voice of Yahweh, but rebel

        against the commandment of Yahweh, then will the hand of Yahweh

        be against you, as it was against your fathers.

012:016 Now therefore stand still and see this great thing, which Yahweh

        will do before your eyes.

012:017 Isn't it wheat harvest today?  I will call to Yahweh,

        that he may send thunder and rain; and you shall know and see

        that your wickedness is great, which you have done in the sight

        of Yahweh, in asking you a king.

012:018 So Samuel called to Yahweh; and Yahweh sent thunder and rain

        that day:  and all the people greatly feared Yahweh and Samuel.

012:019 All the people said to Samuel, Pray for your servants to Yahweh

        your God, that we not die; for we have added to all our sins

        [this] evil, to ask us a king.

012:020 Samuel said to the people, "Don't be afraid; you have indeed

        done all this evil; yet don't turn aside from following Yahweh,

        but serve Yahweh with all your heart:

012:021 and don't turn aside; for [then would you go] after vain things

        which can't profit nor deliver, for they are vain.

012:022 For Yahweh will not forsake his people for his great name's sake,

        because it has pleased Yahweh to make you a people to himself.

012:023 Moreover as for me, far be it from me that I should sin against

        Yahweh in ceasing to pray for you:  but I will instruct you

        in the good and the right way.

012:024 Only fear Yahweh, and serve him in truth with all your heart;

        for consider how great things he has done for you.

012:025 But if you shall still do wickedly, you shall be consumed,

        both you and your king."

013:001 Saul was [forty] years old when he began to reign;

        and when he had reigned two years over Israel,

013:002 Saul chose him three thousand men of Israel, of which two

        thousand were with Saul in Michmash and in the Mount of Bethel,

        and one thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin:

        and the rest of the people he sent every man to his tent.

013:003 Jonathan struck the garrison of the Philistines that was in Geba:

        and the Philistines heard of it.  Saul blew the trumpet

        throughout all the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear.

013:004 All Israel heard say that Saul had struck the garrison of

        the Philistines, and also that Israel was had in abomination

        with the Philistines.  The people were gathered together

        after Saul to Gilgal.

013:005 The Philistines assembled themselves together to fight with Israel,

        thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen,

        and people as the sand which is on the seashore in multitude:

        and they came up, and encamped in Michmash, eastward of Beth Aven.

013:006 When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait

        (for the people were distressed), then the people did

        hide themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks,

        and in coverts, and in pits.

013:007 Now some of the Hebrews had gone over the Jordan to the land

        of Gad and Gilead; but as for Saul, he was yet in Gilgal,

        and all the people followed him trembling.

013:008 He stayed seven days, according to the set time that Samuel

        [had appointed]: but Samuel didn't come to Gilgal;

        and the people were scattered from him.

013:009 Saul said, Bring here the burnt offering to me, and the

        peace offerings.  He offered the burnt offering.

013:010 It came to pass that as soon as he had made an end of offering

        the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out

        to meet him, that he might greet him.

013:011 Samuel said, What have you done?  Saul said, Because I saw

        that the people were scattered from me, and that you didn't

        come within the days appointed, and that the Philistines

        assembled themselves together at Michmash;

013:012 therefore said I, Now will the Philistines come down on me

        to Gilgal, and I haven't entreated the favor of Yahweh:  I forced

        myself therefore, and offered the burnt offering.

013:013 Samuel said to Saul, You have done foolishly; you have not kept

        the commandment of Yahweh your God, which he commanded you:

        for now would Yahweh have established your kingdom

        on Israel forever.

013:014 But now your kingdom shall not continue:  Yahweh has sought

        him a man after his own heart, and Yahweh has appointed him

        to be prince over his people, because you have not kept

        that which Yahweh commanded you.

013:015 Samuel arose, and got him up from Gilgal to Gibeah of Benjamin.

        Saul numbered the people who were present with him,

        about six hundred men.

013:016 Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people who were present

        with them, abode in Geba of Benjamin:  but the Philistines

        encamped in Michmash.

013:017 The spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in

        three companies:  one company turned to the way that leads

        to Ophrah, to the land of Shual;

013:018 and another company turned the way to Beth Horon;

        and another company turned the way of the border that looks

        down on the valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.

013:019 Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of Israel;

        for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make them

        swords or spears:

013:020 but all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to sharpen

        every man his plowshare, mattock, axe, and sickle;

013:021 yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the plowshares,

        and for the forks, and for the axes, and to set the goads.

013:022 So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was neither

        sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people who

        were with Saul and Jonathan:  but with Saul and with Jonathan

        his son was there found.

013:023 The garrison of the Philistines went out to the pass of Michmash.

014:001 Now it fell on a day, that Jonathan the son of Saul said

        to the young man who bore his armor, Come, and let us go

        over to the Philistines' garrison, that is on yonder side.

        But he didn't tell his father.

014:002 Saul abode in the uttermost part of Gibeah under the pomegranate

        tree which is in Migron:  and the people who were with him

        were about six hundred men;

014:003 and Ahijah, the son of Ahitub, Ichabod's brother, the son of Phinehas,

        the son of Eli, the priest of Yahweh in Shiloh, wearing an ephod.

        The people didn't know that Jonathan was gone.

014:004 Between the passes, by which Jonathan sought to go over to

        the Philistines' garrison, there was a rocky crag on the one side,

        and a rocky crag on the other side:  and the name of the one

        was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.

014:005 The one crag rose up on the north in front of Michmash,

        and the other on the south in front of Geba.

014:006 Jonathan said to the young man who bore his armor, Come,

        and let us go over to the garrison of these uncircumcised:

        it may be that Yahweh will work for us; for there is no

        restraint to Yahweh to save by many or by few.

014:007 His armor bearer said to him, Do all that is in your heart:

        turn you, behold, I am with you according to your heart.

014:008 Then said Jonathan, Behold, we will pass over to the men,

        and we will disclose ourselves to them.

014:009 If they say thus to us, Wait until we come to you; then we

        will stand still in our place, and will not go up to them.

014:010 But if they say thus, Come up to us; then we will go up;

        for Yahweh has delivered them into our hand:  and this shall

        be the sign to us.

014:011 Both of them disclosed themselves to the garrison of the Philistines:

        and the Philistines said, Behold, the Hebrews come forth

        out of the holes where they had hid themselves.

014:012 The men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his armor bearer,

        and said, Come up to us, and we will show you a thing.

        Jonathan said to his armor bearer, Come up after me;

        for Yahweh has delivered them into the hand of Israel.

014:013 Jonathan climbed up on his hands and on his feet, and his

        armor bearer after him:  and they fell before Jonathan;

        and his armor bearer killed them after him.

014:014 That first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armor bearer made,

        was about twenty men, within as it were half a furrow's length

        in an acre of land.

014:015 There was a trembling in the camp, in the field, and among all

        the people; the garrison, and the spoilers, they also trembled;

        and the earth quaked:  so there was an exceeding great trembling.

014:016 The watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and behold,

        the multitude melted away, and they went [here] and there.

014:017 Then said Saul to the people who were with him, Number now,

        and see who is gone from us.  When they had numbered, behold,

        Jonathan and his armor bearer were not there.

014:018 Saul said to Ahijah, Bring here the ark of God.  For the ark

        of God was [there] at that time with the children of Israel.

014:019 It happened, while Saul talked to the priest, that the tumult

        that was in the camp of the Philistines went on and increased:

        and Saul said to the priest, Withdraw your hand.

014:020 Saul and all the people who were with him were gathered together,

        and came to the battle:  and behold, every man's sword was

        against his fellow, [and there was] a very great confusion.

014:021 Now the Hebrews who were with the Philistines as before,

        and who went up with them into the camp, [from the country]

        round about, even they also [turned] to be with the Israelites

        who were with Saul and Jonathan.

014:022 Likewise all the men of Israel who had hid themselves in the hill

        country of Ephraim, when they heard that the Philistines fled,

        even they also followed hard after them in the battle.

014:023 So Yahweh saved Israel that day:  and the battle passed over

        by Beth Aven.

014:024 The men of Israel were distressed that day; for Saul had

        adjured the people, saying, Cursed be the man who eats any

        food until it be evening, and I be avenged on my enemies.

        So none of the people tasted food.

014:025 All the people came into the forest; and there was honey

        on the ground.

014:026 When the people were come to the forest, behold, the honey dropped:

        but no man put his hand to his mouth; for the people

        feared the oath.

014:027 But Jonathan didn't hear when his father charged the people

        with the oath:  therefore he put forth the end of the rod

        who was in his hand, and dipped it in the honeycomb, and put

        his hand to his mouth; and his eyes were enlightened.

014:028 Then answered one of the people, and said, Your father directly

        charged the people with an oath, saying, Cursed be the man

        who eats food this day.  The people were faint.

014:029 Then said Jonathan, My father has troubled the land.

        Please look how my eyes have been enlightened, because I

        tasted a little of this honey.

014:030 How much more, if haply the people had eaten freely today

        of the spoil of their enemies which they found? for now has

        there been no great slaughter among the Philistines.

014:031 They struck of the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon.

        The people were very faint;

014:032 and the people flew on the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen,

        and calves, and killed them on the ground; and the people

        ate them with the blood.

014:033 Then they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin

        against Yahweh, in that they eat with the blood.

        He said, you have dealt treacherously:  roll a great stone

        to me this day.

014:034 Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and tell them,

        Bring me here every man his ox, and every man his sheep,

        and kill them here, and eat; and don't sin against Yahweh

        in eating with the blood.  All the people brought every man

        his ox with him that night, and killed them there.

014:035 Saul built an altar to Yahweh:  the same was the first altar

        that he built to Yahweh.

014:036 Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night,

        and take spoil among them until the morning light, and let us not

        leave a man of them.  They said, Do whatever seems good to you.

        Then said the priest, Let us draw near here to God.

014:037 Saul asked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the Philistines?

        will you deliver them into the hand of Israel?  But he didn't

        answer him that day.

014:038 Saul said, Draw near here, all you chiefs of the people;

        and know and see in which this sin has been this day.

014:039 For, as Yahweh lives, who saves Israel, though it be in Jonathan

        my son, he shall surely die.  But there was not a man among

        all the people who answered him.

014:040 Then said he to all Israel, Be you on one side,

        and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side.

        The people said to Saul, Do what seems good to you.

014:041 Therefore Saul said to Yahweh, the God of Israel, Show the right.

        Jonathan and Saul were taken [by lot]; but the people escaped.

014:042 Saul said, Cast [lots] between me and Jonathan my son.

        Jonathan was taken.

014:043 Then Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what you have done.

        Jonathan told him, and said, I did certainly taste a little

        honey with the end of the rod that was in my hand; and behold,

        I must die.

014:044 Saul said, God do so and more also; for you shall

        surely die, Jonathan.

014:045 The people said to Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who has

        worked this great salvation in Israel?  Far from it:

        as Yahweh lives, there shall not one hair of his head

        fall to the ground; for he has worked with God this day.

        So the people rescued Jonathan, that he didn't die.

014:046 Then Saul went up from following the Philistines;

        and the Philistines went to their own place.

014:047 Now when Saul had taken the kingdom over Israel, he fought

        against all his enemies on every side, against Moab,

        and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom,

        and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines:

        and wherever he turned himself, he put [them] to the worse.

014:048 He did valiantly, and struck the Amalekites, and delivered

        Israel out of the hands of those who despoiled them.

014:049 Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishvi, and Malchishua;

        and the names of his two daughters were these:  the name

        of the firstborn Merab, and the name of the younger Michal:

014:050 and the name of Saul's wife was Ahinoam the daughter of Ahimaaz.

        The name of the captain of his army was Abner the son

        of Ner, Saul's uncle.

014:051 Kish was the father of Saul; and Ner the father of Abner was

        the son of Abiel.

014:052 There was sore war against the Philistines all the days of Saul:

        and when Saul saw any mighty man, or any valiant man,

        he took him to him.

015:001 Samuel said to Saul, Yahweh sent me to anoint you to be king

        over his people, over Israel:  now therefore listen you

        to the voice of the words of Yahweh.

015:002 Thus says Yahweh of Armies, I have marked that which Amalek

        did to Israel, how he set himself against him in the way,

        when he came up out of Egypt.

015:003 Now go and strike Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have,

        and don't spare them; but kill both man and woman,

        infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and donkey.

015:004 Saul summoned the people, and numbered them in Telaim,

        two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah.

015:005 Saul came to the city of Amalek, and laid wait in the valley.

015:006 Saul said to the Kenites, Go, depart, get you down from among

        the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them; for you shown kindness

        to all the children of Israel, when they came up out of Egypt.

        So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.

015:007 Saul struck the Amalekites, from Havilah as you go to Shur,

        that is before Egypt.

015:008 He took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly

        destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.

015:009 But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep,

        and of the oxen, and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and all

        that was good, and wouldn't utterly destroy them:  but everything

        that was vile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly.

015:010 Then came the word of Yahweh to Samuel, saying,

015:011 It grieves me that I have set up Saul to be king; for he is turned

        back from following me, and has not performed my commandments.

        Samuel was angry; and he cried to Yahweh all night.

015:012 Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning; and it

        was told Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and behold,

        he set him up a monument, and turned, and passed on,

        and went down to Gilgal.

015:013 Samuel came to Saul; and Saul said to him, Blessed are you

        by Yahweh:  I have performed the commandment of Yahweh.

015:014 Samuel said, What means then this bleating of the sheep in my ears,

        and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?

015:015 Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites:

        for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen,

        to sacrifice to Yahweh your God; and the rest we

        have utterly destroyed.

015:016 Then Samuel said to Saul, Stay, and I will tell you what Yahweh

        has said to me this night.  He said to him, Say on.

015:017 Samuel said, "Though you were little in your own sight,

        weren't you made the head of the tribes of Israel?  Yahweh anointed

        you king over Israel;

015:018 and Yahweh sent you on a journey, and said, 'Go, and utterly

        destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them

        until they are consumed.'

015:019 Why then didn't you obey the voice of Yahweh, but flew on the spoil,

        and did that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh?"

015:020 Saul said to Samuel, Yes, I have obeyed the voice of Yahweh,

        and have gone the way which Yahweh sent me, and have brought Agag

        the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites.

015:021 But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief

        of the devoted things, to sacrifice to Yahweh your God in Gilgal.

015:022 Samuel said, Has Yahweh as great delight in burnt offerings

        and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of Yahweh?  Behold, to obey

        is better than sacrifice, and to listen than the fat of rams.

015:023 For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is

        as idolatry and teraphim.  Because you have rejected the word

        of Yahweh, he has also rejected you from being king.

015:024 Saul said to Samuel, I have sinned; for I have transgressed

        the commandment of Yahweh, and your words, because I feared

        the people, and obeyed their voice.

015:025 Now therefore, please pardon my sin, and turn again with me,

        that I may worship Yahweh.

015:026 Samuel said to Saul, I will not return with you; for you

        have rejected the word of Yahweh, and Yahweh has rejected

        you from being king over Israel.

015:027 As Samuel turned about to go away, [Saul] laid hold on the skirt

        of his robe, and it tore.

015:028 Samuel said to him, Yahweh has torn the kingdom of Israel

        from you this day, and has given it to a neighbor of yours

        who is better than you.

015:029 Also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent;

        for he is not a man, that he should repent.

015:030 Then he said, I have sinned:  yet honor me now, Please, before the

        elders of my people, and before Israel, and turn again with me,

        that I may worship Yahweh your God.

015:031 So Samuel turned again after Saul; and Saul worshiped Yahweh.

015:032 Then said Samuel, Bring you here to me Agag the king

        of the Amalekites.  Agag came to him cheerfully.

        Agag said, Surely the bitterness of death is past.

015:033 Samuel said, As your sword has made women childless, so shall

        your mother be childless among women.  Samuel hewed Agag

        in pieces before Yahweh in Gilgal.

015:034 Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house

        to Gibeah of Saul.

015:035 Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death;

        for Samuel mourned for Saul:  and Yahweh grieved that he had

        made Saul king over Israel.

016:001 Yahweh said to Samuel, How long will you mourn for Saul, seeing I

        have rejected him from being king over Israel? fill your horn

        with oil, and go:  I will send you to Jesse the Bethlehemite;

        for I have provided me a king among his sons.

016:002 Samuel said, How can I go? if Saul hear it, he will kill me.

        Yahweh said, Take a heifer with you, and say, I am come

        to sacrifice to Yahweh.

016:003 Call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what you shall do:

        and you shall anoint to me him whom I name to you.

016:004 Samuel did that which Yahweh spoke, and came to Bethlehem.

        The elders of the city came to meet him trembling, and said,

        Come you peaceably?

016:005 He said, Peaceably; I am come to sacrifice to Yahweh:

        sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice.

        He sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the sacrifice.

016:006 It happened, when they had come, that he looked at Eliab,

        and said, Surely Yahweh's anointed is before him.

016:007 But Yahweh said to Samuel, "Don't look on his face, or on

        the height of his stature; because I have rejected him:

        for [Yahweh sees] not as man sees; for man looks at the

        outward appearance, but Yahweh looks at the heart."

016:008 Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel.

        He said, Neither has Yahweh chosen this.

016:009 Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by.  He said, Neither has

        Yahweh chosen this.

016:010 Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel.

        Samuel said to Jesse, Yahweh has not chosen these.

016:011 Samuel said to Jesse, Are here all your children?

        He said, There remains yet the youngest, and behold, he is

        keeping the sheep.  Samuel said to Jesse, Send and get him;

        for we will not sit down until he come here.

016:012 He sent, and brought him in.  Now he was ruddy,

        and withal of a beautiful face, and goodly to look on.

        Yahweh said, Arise, anoint him; for this is he.

016:013 Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the midst

        of his brothers:  and the Spirit of Yahweh came mightily

        on David from that day forward.  So Samuel rose up,

        and went to Ramah.

016:014 Now the Spirit of Yahweh departed from Saul, and an evil spirit

        from Yahweh troubled him.

016:015 Saul's servants said to him, See now, an evil spirit from

        God troubles you.

016:016 Let our lord now command your servants who are before you,

        to seek out a man who is a skillful player on the harp:

        and it shall happen, when the evil spirit from God is on you,

        that he shall play with his hand, and you shall be well.

016:017 Saul said to his servants, Provide me now a man who can play well,

        and bring him to me.

016:018 Then answered one of the young men, and said, Behold, I have seen

        a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, who is skillful in playing,

        and a mighty man of valor, and a man of war, and prudent

        in speech, and a comely person; and Yahweh is with him.

016:019 Therefore Saul sent messengers to Jesse, and said, Send me

        David your son, who is with the sheep.

016:020 Jesse took a donkey loaded with bread, and a bottle of wine,

        and a kid, and sent them by David his son to Saul.

016:021 David came to Saul, and stood before him:  and he loved him greatly;

        and he became his armor bearer.

016:022 Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Please let David stand before me;

        for he has found favor in my sight.

016:023 It happened, when the [evil] spirit from God was on Saul,

        that David took the harp, and played with his hand:

        so Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit

        departed from him.

017:001 Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle;

        and they were gathered together at Socoh, which belongs to Judah,

        and encamped between Socoh and Azekah, in Ephesdammim.

017:002 Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together,

        and encamped in the valley of Elah, and set the battle in array

        against the Philistines.

017:003 The Philistines stood on the mountain on the one side,

        and Israel stood on the mountain on the other side:

        and there was a valley between them.

017:004 There went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines,

        named Goliath, of Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span.

017:005 He had a helmet of brass on his head, and he was clad with a

        coat of mail; and the weight of the coat was five thousand

        shekels of brass.

017:006 He had brass shin armor on his legs, and a javelin of brass

        between his shoulders.

017:007 The staff of his spear was like a weaver's beam;

        and his spear's head [weighed] six hundred shekels of iron:

        and his shield bearer went before him.

017:008 He stood and cried to the armies of Israel, and said to them,

        Why are you come out to set your battle in array? am I not

        a Philistine, and you servants to Saul? choose you a man for you,

        and let him come down to me.

017:009 If he be able to fight with me, and kill me, then will we

        be your servants; but if I prevail against him, and kill him,

        then shall you be our servants, and serve us.

017:010 The Philistine said, I defy the armies of Israel this day;

        give me a man, that we may fight together.

017:011 When Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine,

        they were dismayed, and greatly afraid.

017:012 Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Bethlehem Judah,

        whose name was Jesse; and he had eight sons:  and the man was

        an old man in the days of Saul, stricken [in years] among men.

017:013 The three eldest sons of Jesse had gone after Saul to the battle:

        and the names of his three sons who went to the battle

        were Eliab the firstborn, and next to him Abinadab,

        and the third Shammah.

017:014 David was the youngest; and the three eldest followed Saul.

017:015 Now David went back and forth from Saul to feed his father's

        sheep at Bethlehem.

017:016 The Philistine drew near morning and evening, and presented

        himself forty days.

017:017 Jesse said to David his son, Take now for your brothers

        an ephah of this parched grain, and these ten loaves,

        and carry [them] quickly to the camp to your brothers;

017:018 and bring these ten cheeses to the captain of their thousand,

        and look how your brothers fare, and take their pledge.

017:019 Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel, were in the valley

        of Elah, fighting with the Philistines.

017:020 David rose up early in the morning, and left the sheep with

        a keeper, and took, and went, as Jesse had commanded him;

        and he came to the place of the wagons, as the army which was

        going forth to the fight shouted for the battle.

017:021 Israel and the Philistines put the battle in array,

        army against army.

017:022 David left his baggage in the hand of the keeper of the baggage,

        and ran to the army, and came and greeted his brothers.

017:023 As he talked with them, behold, there came up the champion,

        the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, out of the ranks

        of the Philistines, and spoke according to the same words:

        and David heard them.

017:024 All the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from him,

        and were sore afraid.

017:025 The men of Israel said, Have you seen this man who is come

        up? surely to defy Israel is he come up:  and it shall be,

        that the man who kills him, the king will enrich him

        with great riches, and will give him his daughter, and make

        his father's house free in Israel.

017:026 David spoke to the men who stood by him, saying, What shall

        be done to the man who kills this Philistine, and takes away

        the reproach from Israel? for who is this uncircumcised Philistine,

        that he should defy the armies of the living God?

017:027 The people answered him after this manner, saying, So shall

        it be done to the man who kills him.

017:028 Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spoke to the men; and Eliab's

        anger was kindled against David, and he said, Why are you come down?

        and with whom have you left those few sheep in the wilderness?

        I know your pride, and the naughtiness of your heart;

        for you have come down that you might see the battle.

017:029 David said, What have I now done?  Is there not a cause?

017:030 He turned away from him toward another, and spoke after

        the same manner:  and the people answered him again after

        the former manner.

017:031 When the words were heard which David spoke, they rehearsed

        them before Saul; and he sent for him.

017:032 David said to Saul, Let no man's heart fail because of him;

        your servant will go and fight with this Philistine.

017:033 Saul said to David, You are not able to go against this

        Philistine to fight with him; for you are but a youth,

        and he a man of war from his youth.

017:034 David said to Saul, Your servant was keeping his father's sheep;

        and when there came a lion, or a bear, and took a lamb out

        of the flock,

017:035 I went out after him, and struck him, and delivered it out

        of his mouth; and when he arose against me, I caught him

        by his beard, and struck him, and killed him.

017:036 Your servant struck both the lion and the bear:

        and this uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them,

        seeing he has defied the armies of the living God.

017:037 David said, Yahweh who delivered me out of the paw of the lion,

        and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the hand

        of this Philistine.  Saul said to David, Go, and Yahweh shall

        be with you.

017:038 Saul clad David with his clothing, and he put a helmet of brass

        on his head, and he clad him with a coat of mail.

017:039 David girded his sword on his clothing, and he tried to go;

        for he had not proved it.  David said to Saul, I can't go with these;

        for I have not proved them.  David put them off him.

017:040 He took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth stones

        out of the brook, and put them in the shepherd's bag which

        he had, even in his wallet; and his sling was in his hand:

        and he drew near to the Philistine.

017:041 The Philistine came on and drew near to David; and the man

        who bore the shield went before him.

017:042 When the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he disdained him;

        for he was but a youth, and ruddy, and withal of a fair face.

017:043 The Philistine said to David, Am I a dog, that you come to me

        with sticks?  The Philistine cursed David by his gods.

017:044 The Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give

        your flesh to the birds of the sky, and to the animals

        of the field.

017:045 Then said David to the Philistine, You come to me with a sword,

        and with a spear, and with a javelin:  but I come to you in

        the name of Yahweh of Armies, the God of the armies of Israel,

        whom you have defied.

017:046 This day will Yahweh deliver you into my hand; and I will

        strike you, and take your head from off you; and I will give

        the dead bodies of the army of the Philistines this day

        to the birds of the sky, and to the wild animals of the earth;

        that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel,

017:047 and that all this assembly may know that Yahweh doesn't

        save with sword and spear:  for the battle is Yahweh's,

        and he will give you into our hand.

017:048 It happened, when the Philistine arose, and came and drew near

        to meet David, that David hurried, and ran toward the army

        to meet the Philistine.

017:049 David put his hand in his bag, and took there a stone,

        and slang it, and struck the Philistine in his forehead;

        and the stone sank into his forehead, and he fell on his face

        to the earth.

017:050 So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and

        with a stone, and struck the Philistine, and killed him;

        but there was no sword in the hand of David.

017:051 Then David ran, and stood over the Philistine, and took his sword,

        and drew it out of the sheath of it, and killed him,

        and cut off his head therewith.  When the Philistines saw

        that their champion was dead, they fled.

017:052 The men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and pursued

        the Philistines, until you come to Gai, and to the gates of Ekron.

        The wounded of the Philistines fell down by the way to Shaaraim,

        even to Gath, and to Ekron.

017:053 The children of Israel returned from chasing after the Philistines,

        and they plundered their camp.

017:054 David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to Jerusalem;

        but he put his armor in his tent.

017:055 When Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said to Abner,

        the captain of the army, Abner, whose son is this youth?

        Abner said, As your soul lives, O king, I can't tell.

017:056 The king said, "Inquire whose son the young man is!"

017:057 As David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner

        took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of

        the Philistine in his hand.

017:058 Saul said to him, Whose son are you, you young man?

        David answered, I am the son of your servant Jesse the Bethlehemite.

018:001 It happened, when he had made an end of speaking to Saul,

        that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of David,

        and Jonathan loved him as his own soul.

018:002 Saul took him that day, and would let him go no more home

        to his father's house.

018:003 Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him

        as his own soul.

018:004 Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was on him,

        and gave it to David, and his clothing, even to his sword,

        and to his bow, and to his sash.

018:005 David went out wherever Saul sent him, [and] behaved himself wisely:

        and Saul set him over the men of war, and it was good in the sight

        of all the people, and also in the sight of Saul's servants.

018:006 It happened as they came, when David returned from the slaughter

        of the Philistine, that the women came out of all the cities

        of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul,

        with tambourines, with joy, and with instruments of music.

018:007 The women sang one to another as they played, and said,

        Saul has slain his thousands, David his ten thousands.

018:008 Saul was very angry, and this saying displeased him;

        and he said, They have ascribed to David ten thousands,

        and to me they have ascribed but thousands:  and what can

        he have more but the kingdom?

018:009 Saul eyed David from that day and forward.

018:010 It happened on the next day, that an evil spirit from God came

        mightily on Saul, and he prophesied in the midst of the house:

        and David played with his hand, as he did day by day.

        Saul had his spear in his hand;

018:011 and Saul cast the spear; for he said, I will strike David

        even to the wall.  David avoided out of his presence twice.

018:012 Saul was afraid of David, because Yahweh was with him,

        and was departed from Saul.

018:013 Therefore Saul removed him from him, and made him his captain

        over a thousand; and he went out and came in before the people.

018:014 David behaved himself wisely in all his ways; and Yahweh

        was with him.

018:015 When Saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely, he stood

        in awe of him.

018:016 But all Israel and Judah loved David; for he went out and came

        in before them.

018:017 Saul said to David, Behold, my elder daughter Merab, her will I give

        you as wife:  only be valiant for me, and fight Yahweh's battles.

        For Saul said, Don't let my hand be on him, but let the hand

        of the Philistines be on him.

018:018 David said to Saul, Who am I, and what is my life, [or] my

        father's family in Israel, that I should be son-in-law

        to the king?

018:019 But it happened at the time when Merab, Saul's daughter,

        should have been given to David, that she was given to Adriel

        the Meholathite as wife.

018:020 Michal, Saul's daughter, loved David:  and they told Saul,

        and the thing pleased him.

018:021 Saul said, I will give her to him, that she may be a snare to him,

        and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him.

        Therefore Saul said to David, You shall this day be my son-in-law

        a second time.

018:022 Saul commanded his servants, [saying], Commune with David secretly,

        and say, Behold, the king has delight in you, and all his

        servants love you:  now therefore be the king's son-in-law.

018:023 Saul's servants spoke those words in the ears of David.

        David said, Seems it to you a light thing to be the king's

        son-in-law, seeing that I am a poor man, and lightly esteemed?

018:024 The servants of Saul told him, saying, On this manner spoke David.

018:025 Saul said, Thus shall you tell David, The king desires

        no dowry except one hundred foreskins of the Philistines,

        to be avenged of the king's enemies.  Now Saul thought to make

        David fall by the hand of the Philistines.

018:026 When his servants told David these words, it pleased David

        well to be the king's son-in-law. The days were not expired;

018:027 and David arose and went, he and his men, and killed

        of the Philistines two hundred men; and David brought

        their foreskins, and they gave them in full number to the king,

        that he might be the king's son-in-law. Saul gave him Michal

        his daughter as wife.

018:028 Saul saw and knew that Yahweh was with David;

        and Michal, Saul's daughter, loved him.

018:029 Saul was yet the more afraid of David; and Saul was

        David's enemy continually.

018:030 Then the princes of the Philistines went forth:

        and it happened, as often as they went forth, that David

        behaved himself more wisely than all the servants of Saul;

        so that his name was much set by.

019:001 Saul spoke to Jonathan his son, and to all his servants,

        that they should kill David.  But Jonathan, Saul's son,

        delighted much in David.

019:002 Jonathan told David, saying, Saul my father seeks to kill you:

        now therefore, please take care of yourself in the morning,

        and live in a secret place, and hide yourself:

019:003 and I will go out and stand beside my father in the field

        where you are, and I will commune with my father of you;

        and if I see anything, I will tell you.

019:004 Jonathan spoke good of David to Saul his father, and said to him,

        Don't let the king sin against his servant, against David;

        because he has not sinned against you, and because his works

        have been very good toward you:

019:005 for he put his life in his hand, and struck the Philistine,

        and Yahweh worked a great victory for all Israel:  you saw it,

        and did rejoice; why then will you sin against innocent blood,

        to kill David without a cause?

019:006 Saul listened to the voice of Jonathan:  and Saul swore,

        As Yahweh lives, he shall not be put to death.

019:007 Jonathan called David, and Jonathan showed him all those things.

        Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence,

        as before.

019:008 There was war again:  and David went out, and fought with

        the Philistines, and killed them with a great slaughter;

        and they fled before him.

019:009 An evil spirit from Yahweh was on Saul, as he sat in his house

        with his spear in his hand; and David was playing with his hand.

019:010 Saul sought to strike David even to the wall with the spear;

        but he slipped away out of Saul's presence, and he struck

        the spear into the wall:  and David fled, and escaped that night.

019:011 Saul sent messengers to David's house, to watch him,

        and to kill him in the morning:  and Michal, David's wife,

        told him, saying, If you don't save your life tonight,

        tomorrow you will be slain.

019:012 So Michal let David down through the window:  and he went,

        and fled, and escaped.

019:013 Michal took the teraphim, and laid it in the bed, and put

        a pillow of goats' [hair] at the head of it, and covered it

        with the clothes.

019:014 When Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, He is sick.

019:015 Saul sent the messengers to see David, saying, Bring him up

        to me in the bed, that I may kill him.

019:016 When the messengers came in, behold, the teraphim was in the bed,

        with the pillow of goats' [hair] at the head of it.

019:017 Saul said to Michal, Why have you deceived me thus, and let my

        enemy go, so that he is escaped?  Michal answered Saul, He said

        to me, Let me go; why should I kill you?

019:018 Now David fled, and escaped, and came to Samuel to Ramah,

        and told him all that Saul had done to him.  He and Samuel

        went and lived in Naioth.

019:019 It was told Saul, saying, Behold, David is at Naioth in Ramah.

019:020 Saul sent messengers to take David:  and when they saw the company

        of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as head

        over them, the Spirit of God came on the messengers of Saul,

        and they also prophesied.

019:021 When it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they

        also prophesied.  Saul sent messengers again the third time,

        and they also prophesied.

019:022 Then went he also to Ramah, and came to the great well

        that is in Secu:  and he asked and said, Where are Samuel

        and David?  One said, Behold, they are at Naioth in Ramah.

019:023 He went there to Naioth in Ramah:  and the Spirit of God came

        on him also, and he went on, and prophesied, until he came

        to Naioth in Ramah.

019:024 He also stripped off his clothes, and he also prophesied

        before Samuel, and lay down naked all that day and all that night.

        Therefore they say, "Is Saul also among the prophets?"

020:001 David fled from Naioth in Ramah, and came and said

        before Jonathan, "What have I done?  What is my iniquity?"

        and "What is my sin before your father, that he seeks my life?"

020:002 He said to him, "Far from it; you shall not die:  behold, my father

        does nothing either great or small, but that he discloses it

        to me; and why should my father hide this thing from me?

        It is not so."

020:003 David swore moreover, and said, "Your father knows

        well that I have found favor in your eyes; and he says,

        'Don't let Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved:'

        but truly as Yahweh lives, and as your soul lives, there is

        but a step between me and death."

020:004 Then said Jonathan to David, "Whatever your soul desires,

        I will even do it for you."

020:005 David said to Jonathan, "Behold, tomorrow is the new moon,

        and I should not fail to dine with the king; but let me go,

        that I may hide myself in the field to the third day at evening.

020:006 If your father miss me at all, then say, 'David earnestly

        asked leave of me that he might run to Bethlehem his city;

        for it is the yearly sacrifice there for all the family.'

020:007 If he says, 'It is well;' your servant shall have peace:

        but if he be angry, then know that evil is determined by him.

020:008 Therefore deal kindly with your servant; for you have

        brought your servant into a covenant of Yahweh with you:

        but if there be in me iniquity, kill me yourself; for why

        should you bring me to your father?"

020:009 Jonathan said, "Far be it from you; for if I should at all

        know that evil were determined by my father to come on you,

        then wouldn't I tell you that?"

020:010 Then said David to Jonathan, "Who shall tell me if perchance

        your father answer you roughly?"

020:011 Jonathan said to David, "Come, and let us go out into the field."

        They both went out into the field.

020:012 Jonathan said to David, "Yahweh, the God of Israel, [be witness]:

        when I have sounded my father about this time tomorrow,

        [or] the third day, behold, if there be good toward David,

        shall I not then send to you, and disclose it to you?

020:013 Yahweh do so to Jonathan, and more also, should it please my

        father to do you evil, if I don't disclose it to you, and send

        you away, that you may go in peace:  and Yahweh be with you,

        as he has been with my father.

020:014 You shall not only while yet I live show me the loving kindness

        of Yahweh, that I not die;

020:015 but also you shall not cut off your kindness from my house forever;

        no, not when Yahweh has cut off the enemies of David everyone

        from the surface of the earth."

020:016 So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David, [saying],

        Yahweh will require it at the hand of David's enemies.

020:017 Jonathan caused David to swear again, for the love that he had

        to him; for he loved him as he loved his own soul.

020:018 Then Jonathan said to him, Tomorrow is the new moon:

        and you will be missed, because your seat will be empty.

020:019 When you have stayed three days, you shall go down quickly,

        and come to the place where you did hide yourself when the

        business was in hand, and shall remain by the stone Ezel.

020:020 I will shoot three arrows on the side of it, as though I shot

        at a mark.

020:021 Behold, I will send the boy, [saying], Go, find the arrows.

        If I tell the boy, Behold, the arrows are on this side of you;

        take them, and come; for there is peace to you and no hurt,

        as Yahweh lives.

020:022 But if I say thus to the boy, Behold, the arrows are beyond you;

        go your way; for Yahweh has sent you away.

020:023 As touching the matter which you and I have spoken of, behold,

        Yahweh is between you and me forever.

020:024 So David hid himself in the field:  and when the new moon was come,

        the king sat him down to eat food.

020:025 The king sat on his seat, as at other times, even on the seat

        by the wall; and Jonathan stood up, and Abner sat by Saul's side:

        but David's place was empty.

020:026 Nevertheless Saul didn't say anything that day:

        for he thought, Something has happened to him.  He is not clean.

        Surely he is not clean.

020:027 It happened on the next day after the new moon, [which was]

        the second [day], that David's place was empty:  and Saul said

        to Jonathan his son, Why doesn't the son of Jesse come to meat,

        neither yesterday, nor today?

020:028 Jonathan answered Saul, David earnestly asked leave of me

        to go to Bethlehem:

020:029 and he said, Please let me go, for our family has a sacrifice

        in the city; and my brother, he has commanded me [to

        be there]: and now, if I have found favor in your eyes,

        let me get away, I pray you, and see my brothers.

        Therefore he is not come to the king's table.

020:030 Then Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said

        to him, You son of a perverse rebellious woman, don't I know

        that you have chosen the son of Jesse to your own shame,

        and to the shame of your mother's nakedness?

020:031 For as long as the son of Jesse lives on the earth, you shall

        not be established, nor your kingdom.  Therefore now send

        and bring him to me, for he shall surely die.

020:032 Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said to him, "Why should

        he be put to death?  What has he done?"

020:033 Saul cast his spear at him to strike him.  By this Jonathan

        knew that his father was determined to put David to death.

020:034 So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and ate no food

        the second day of the month; for he was grieved for David,

        because his father had done him shame.

020:035 It happened in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the field

        at the time appointed with David, and a little boy with him.

020:036 He said to his boy, Run, find now the arrows which I shoot.

        As the boy ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.

020:037 When the boy was come to the place of the arrow which

        Jonathan had shot, Jonathan cried after the boy, and said,

        Isn't the arrow beyond you?

020:038 Jonathan cried after the boy, Go fast!  Hurry!  Don't delay!

        Jonathan's boy gathered up the arrows, and came to his master.

020:039 But the boy didn't know anything:  only Jonathan and David

        knew the matter.

020:040 Jonathan gave his weapons to his boy, and said to him, Go,

        carry them to the city.

020:041 As soon as the boy was gone, David arose out of [a place]

        toward the South, and fell on his face to the ground,

        and bowed himself three times:  and they kissed one another,

        and wept one with another, until David exceeded.

020:042 Jonathan said to David, Go in peace, because we have sworn

        both of us in the name of Yahweh, saying, Yahweh shall be

        between me and you, and between my seed and your seed, forever.

        He arose and departed:  and Jonathan went into the city.

021:001 Then came David to Nob to Ahimelech the priest:

        and Ahimelech came to meet David trembling, and said to him,

        Why are you alone, and no man with you?

021:002 David said to Ahimelech the priest, The king has commanded me

        a business, and has said to me, Let no man know anything of the

        business about which I send you, and what I have commanded you:

        and I have appointed the young men to such and such a place.

021:003 Now therefore what is under your hand? give me five loaves

        of bread in my hand, or whatever there is present.

021:004 The priest answered David, and said, There is no common bread

        under my hand, but there is holy bread; if only the young

        men have kept themselves from women.

021:005 David answered the priest, and said to him, Of a truth

        women have been kept from us about these three days;

        when I came out, the vessels of the young men were holy,

        though it was but a common journey; how much more then today

        shall their vessels be holy?

021:006 So the priest gave him holy [bread]; for there was no bread

        there but the show bread, that was taken from before Yahweh,

        to put hot bread in the day when it was taken away.

021:007 Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day,

        detained before Yahweh; and his name was Doeg the Edomite,

        the best of the herdsmen who belonged to Saul.

021:008 David said to Ahimelech, Isn't there here under your hand spear

        or sword? for I have neither brought my sword nor my weapons

        with me, because the king's business required haste.

021:009 The priest said, The sword of Goliath the Philistine,

        whom you killed in the valley of Elah, behold, it is here

        wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod:  if you will take that,

        take it; for there is no other except that here.

        David said, There is none like that; give it me.

021:010 David arose, and fled that day for fear of Saul, and went

        to Achish the king of Gath.

021:011 The servants of Achish said to him, "Isn't this David

        the king of the land?  Didn't they sing one to another

        about him in dances, saying, 'Saul has slain his thousands,

        David his ten thousands?'"

021:012 David laid up these words in his heart, and was very afraid

        of Achish the king of Gath.

021:013 He changed his behavior before them, and feigned himself mad

        in their hands, and scrabbled on the doors of the gate,

        and let his spittle fall down on his beard.

021:014 Then said Achish to his servants, Look, you see the man is mad;

        why then have you brought him to me?

021:015 Do I lack madmen, that you have brought this fellow to play

        the madman in my presence? shall this fellow come into my house?

022:001 David therefore departed there, and escaped to the cave of Adullam:

        and when his brothers and all his father's house heard it,

        they went down there to him.

022:002 Everyone who was in distress, and everyone who was in debt,

        and everyone who was discontented, gathered themselves to him;

        and he became captain over them:  and there were with him

        about four hundred men.

022:003 David went there to Mizpeh of Moab:  and he said to the king

        of Moab, Please let my father and my mother come forth,

        [and be] with you, until I know what God will do for me.

022:004 He brought them before the king of Moab:  and they lived

        with him all the while that David was in the stronghold.

022:005 The prophet Gad said to David, Don't stay in the stronghold;

        depart, and get you into the land of Judah.  Then David departed,

        and came into the forest of Hereth.

022:006 Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men who were with him:

        now Saul was sitting in Gibeah, under the tamarisk tree

        in Ramah, with his spear in his hand, and all his servants

        were standing about him.

022:007 Saul said to his servants who stood about him, Hear now,

        you Benjamites; will the son of Jesse give everyone of you

        fields and vineyards, will he make you all captains of thousands

        and captains of hundreds,

022:008 that all of you have conspired against me, and there is none

        who discloses to me when my son makes a league with the son

        of Jesse, and there is none of you who is sorry for me,

        or discloses to me that my son has stirred up my servant

        against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?

022:009 Then answered Doeg the Edomite, who stood by the servants

        of Saul, and said, I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob,

        to Ahimelech the son of Ahitub.

022:010 He inquired of Yahweh for him, and gave him food, and gave

        him the sword of Goliath the Philistine.

022:011 Then the king sent to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub,

        and all his father's house, the priests who were in Nob:

        and they came all of them to the king.

022:012 Saul said, Hear now, you son of Ahitub.  He answered,

        Here I am, my lord.

022:013 Saul said to him, Why have you conspired against me,

        you and the son of Jesse, in that you have given him bread,

        and a sword, and have inquired of God for him, that he should

        rise against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?

022:014 Then Ahimelech answered the king, and said, Who among all your

        servants is so faithful as David, who is the king's son-in-law,

        and is taken into your council, and is honorable in your house?

022:015 Have I today begun to inquire of God for him? be it far from me:

        don't let the king impute anything to his servant, nor to

        all the house of my father; for your servant knows nothing

        of all this, less or more.

022:016 The king said, You shall surely die, Ahimelech, you, and all

        your father's house.

022:017 The king said to the guard who stood about him, Turn, and kill

        the priests of Yahweh; because their hand also is with David,

        and because they knew that he fled, and didn't disclose it to me.

        But the servants of the king wouldn't put forth their hand

        to fall on the priests of Yahweh.

022:018 The king said to Doeg, Turn you, and fall on the priests.

        Doeg the Edomite turned, and he fell on the priests,

        and he killed on that day eighty-five persons who wore

        a linen ephod.

022:019 Nob, the city of the priests, struck he with the edge of

        the sword, both men and women, children and nursing babies,

        and oxen and donkeys and sheep, with the edge of the sword.

022:020 One of the sons of Ahimelech, the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar,

        escaped, and fled after David.

022:021 Abiathar told David that Saul had slain Yahweh's priests.

022:022 David said to Abiathar, I knew on that day, when Doeg the Edomite

        was there, that he would surely tell Saul:  I have occasioned

        [the death] of all the persons of your father's house.

022:023 Abide you with me, don't be afraid; for he who seeks my life

        seeks your life:  for with me you shall be in safeguard.

023:001 They told David, saying, Behold, the Philistines are fighting

        against Keilah, and are robbing the threshing floors.

023:002 Therefore David inquired of Yahweh, saying, Shall I go and strike

        these Philistines?  Yahweh said to David, Go, and strike

        the Philistines, and save Keilah.

023:003 David's men said to him, Behold, we are afraid here in Judah:

        how much more then if we go to Keilah against the armies

        of the Philistines?

023:004 Then David inquired of Yahweh yet again.  Yahweh answered him,

        and said, Arise, go down to Keilah; for I will deliver

        the Philistines into your hand.

023:005 David and his men went to Keilah, and fought with the Philistines,

        and brought away their livestock, and killed them with a

        great slaughter.  So David saved the inhabitants of Keilah.

023:006 It happened, when Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David

        to Keilah, that he came down with an ephod in his hand.

023:007 It was told Saul that David was come to Keilah.  Saul said,

        God has delivered him into my hand; for he is shut in,

        by entering into a town that has gates and bars.

023:008 Saul summoned all the people to war, to go down to Keilah,

        to besiege David and his men.

023:009 David knew that Saul was devising mischief against him;

        and he said to Abiathar the priest, Bring here the ephod.

023:010 Then said David, O Yahweh, the God of Israel, your servant has

        surely heard that Saul seeks to come to Keilah, to destroy

        the city for my sake.

023:011 Will the men of Keilah deliver me up into his hand?

        will Saul come down, as your servant has heard?

        Yahweh, the God of Israel, I beg you, tell your servant.

        Yahweh said, He will come down.

023:012 Then said David, Will the men of Keilah deliver up to me

        and my men into the hand of Saul?  Yahweh said, They will

        deliver you up.

023:013 Then David and his men, who were about six hundred, arose and

        departed out of Keilah, and went wherever they could go.

        It was told Saul that David was escaped from Keilah;

        and he gave up going there.

023:014 David abode in the wilderness in the strongholds,

        and remained in the hill country in the wilderness of Ziph.

        Saul sought him every day, but God didn't deliver him

        into his hand.

023:015 David saw that Saul had come out to seek his life:

        and David was in the wilderness of Ziph in the wood.

023:016 Jonathan, Saul's son, arose, and went to David into the wood,

        and strengthened his hand in God.

023:017 He said to him, Don't be afraid; for the hand of Saul my father

        shall not find you; and you shall be king over Israel, and I

        shall be next to you; and that also Saul my father knows.

023:018 They two made a covenant before Yahweh:  and David abode

        in the wood, and Jonathan went to his house.

023:019 Then came up the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doesn't David

        hide himself with us in the strongholds in the wood,

        in the hill of Hachilah, which is on the south of the desert?

023:020 Now therefore, O king, come down, according to all the desire

        of your soul to come down; and our part shall be to deliver

        him up into the king's hand.

023:021 Saul said, Blessed be you of Yahweh; for you have had

        compassion on me.

023:022 Please go make yet more sure, and know and see his place

        where his haunt is, [and] who has seen him there; for it

        is told me that he deals very subtly.

023:023 See therefore, and take knowledge of all the lurking places

        where he hides himself, and come you again to me of a certainty,

        and I will go with you:  and it shall happen, if he be in the land,

        that I will search him out among all the thousands of Judah.

023:024 They arose, and went to Ziph before Saul:  but David and his men

        were in the wilderness of Maon, in the Arabah on the south

        of the desert.

023:025 Saul and his men went to seek him.  When David was told,

        he went down to the rock, and stayed in the wilderness of Maon.

        When Saul heard [that], he pursued after David in the

        wilderness of Maon.

023:026 Saul went on this side of the mountain, and David and his men

        on that side of the mountain:  and David made haste to get

        away for fear of Saul; for Saul and his men compassed David

        and his men round about to take them.

023:027 But there came a messenger to Saul, saying, Haste you, and come;

        for the Philistines have made a raid on the land.

023:028 So Saul returned from pursuing after David, and went

        against the Philistines:  therefore they called that

        place Sela Hammahlekoth.

023:029 David went up from there, and lived in the strongholds

        of En Gedi.

024:001 It happened, when Saul was returned from following the Philistines,

        that it was told him, saying, Behold, David is in the wilderness

        of En Gedi.

024:002 Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel,

        and went to seek David and his men on the rocks of the wild goats.

024:003 He came to the sheep pens by the way, where was a cave;

        and Saul went in to relieve himself.  Now David and his men

        were abiding in the innermost parts of the cave.

024:004 The men of David said to him, Behold, the day of which Yahweh

        said to you, Behold, I will deliver your enemy into your hand,

        and you shall do to him as it shall seem good to you.

        Then David arose, and cut off the skirt of Saul's robe secretly.

024:005 It happened afterward, that David's heart struck him,

        because he had cut off Saul's skirt.

024:006 He said to his men, Yahweh forbid that I should do this thing

        to my lord, Yahweh's anointed, to put forth my hand against him,

        seeing he is Yahweh's anointed.

024:007 So David checked his men with these words, and didn't allow

        them to rise against Saul.  Saul rose up out of the cave,

        and went on his way.

024:008 David also arose afterward, and went out of the cave,

        and cried after Saul, saying, My lord the king.  When Saul

        looked behind him, David bowed with his face to the earth,

        and did obeisance.

024:009 David said to Saul, Why listen you to men's words, saying,

        Behold, David seeks your hurt?

024:010 Behold, this day your eyes have seen how that Yahweh

        had delivered you today into my hand in the cave:

        and some bade me kill you; but [my eye] spared you;

        and I said, I will not put forth my hand against my lord;

        for he is Yahweh's anointed.

024:011 Moreover, my father, behold, yes, see the skirt of your robe

        in my hand; for in that I cut off the skirt of your robe,

        and didn't kill you, know you and see that there is neither evil

        nor disobedience in my hand, and I have not sinned against you,

        though you hunt after my life to take it.

024:012 Yahweh judge between me and you, and Yahweh avenge me of you;

        but my hand shall not be on you.

024:013 As says the proverb of the ancients, Out of the wicked comes

        forth wickedness; but my hand shall not be on you.

024:014 After whom is the king of Israel come out? after whom do you

        pursue? after a dead dog, after a flea.

024:015 Yahweh therefore be judge, and give sentence between me and you,

        and see, and plead my cause, and deliver me out of your hand.

024:016 It came to pass, when David had made an end of speaking

        these words to Saul, that Saul said, Is this your voice,

        my son David?  Saul lifted up his voice, and wept.

024:017 He said to David, You are more righteous than I; for you have

        rendered to me good, whereas I have rendered to you evil.

024:018 You have declared this day how that you have dealt well with me,

        because when Yahweh had delivered me up into your hand,

        you didn't kill me.

024:019 For if a man finds his enemy, will he let him go away unharmed?

        Therefore may Yahweh reward you good for that which you

        have done to me this day.

024:020 Now, behold, I know that you shall surely be king, and that

        the kingdom of Israel shall be established in your hand.

024:021 Swear now therefore to me by Yahweh, that you will not cut

        off my seed after me, and that you will not destroy my name

        out of my father's house.

024:022 David swore to Saul.  Saul went home; but David and his men

        got them up to the stronghold.

025:001 Samuel died; and all Israel gathered themselves together,

        and lamented him, and buried him in his house at Ramah.

        David arose, and went down to the wilderness of Paran.

025:002 There was a man in Maon, whose possessions were in Carmel;

        and the man was very great, and he had three thousand sheep,

        and a thousand goats:  and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel.

025:003 Now the name of the man was Nabal; and the name of his wife Abigail;

        and the woman was of good understanding, and of a beautiful face:

        but the man was churlish and evil in his doings; and he was

        of the house of Caleb.

025:004 David heard in the wilderness that Nabal was shearing his sheep.

025:005 David sent ten young men, and David said to the young men,

        Go up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet him in my name:

025:006 and thus shall you tell him who lives [in prosperity],

        Peace be to you, and peace be to your house, and peace be

        to all that you have.

025:007 Now I have heard that you have shearers:  your shepherds have

        now been with us, and we did them no hurt, neither was there

        anything missing to them, all the while they were in Carmel.

025:008 Ask your young men, and they will tell you:  therefore let

        the young men find favor in your eyes; for we come in a good day.

        Please give whatever comes to your hand, to your servants,

        and to your son David.

025:009 When David's young men came, they spoke to Nabal according

        to all those words in the name of David, and ceased.

025:010 Nabal answered David's servants, and said, Who is David?

        and who is the son of Jesse? there are many servants who break

        away from their masters these days.

025:011 Shall I then take my bread, and my water, and my meat that I

        have killed for my shearers, and give it to men who I don't

        know where they come from?

025:012 So David's young men turned on their way, and went back,

        and came and told him according to all these words.

025:013 David said to his men, Gird you on every man his sword.

        They girded on every man his sword; and David also girded on

        his sword:  and there went up after David about four hundred men;

        and two hundred abode by the baggage.

025:014 But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal's wife,

        saying, Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness

        to Greet our master; and he railed at them.

025:015 But the men were very good to us, and we were not hurt,

        neither missed we anything, as long as we went with them,

        when we were in the fields:

025:016 they were a wall to us both by night and by day, all the while we

        were with them keeping the sheep.

025:017 Now therefore know and consider what you will do; for evil

        is determined against our master, and against all his house:

        for he is such a worthless fellow that one can't speak to him.

025:018 Then Abigail made haste, and took two hundred loaves,

        and two bottles of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five

        measures of parched grain, and one hundred clusters of raisins,

        and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid them on donkeys.

025:019 She said to her young men, Go on before me; behold, I come after you.

        But she didn't tell her husband, Nabal.

025:020 It was so, as she rode on her donkey, and came down by the covert

        of the mountain, that behold, David and his men came down

        toward her; and she met them.

025:021 Now David had said, Surely in vain have I kept all that this

        fellow has in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all

        that pertained to him:  and he has returned me evil for good.

025:022 God do so to the enemies of David, and more also, if I leave

        of all that belongs to him by the morning light so much

        as one who urinates on a wall.{or, male.}

025:023 When Abigail saw David, she hurried, and alighted from her donkey,

        and fell before David on her face, and bowed herself

        to the ground.

025:024 She fell at his feet, and said, On me, my lord, on me be

        the iniquity; and please let your handmaid speak in your ears.

        Hear the words of your handmaid.

025:025 Please don't let my lord regard this worthless fellow, even Nabal;

        for as his name is, so is he; Nabal is his name, and folly

        is with him:  but I your handmaid didn't see the young men

        of my lord, whom you did send.

025:026 Now therefore, my lord, as Yahweh lives, and as your soul lives,

        seeing Yahweh has withheld you from blood guiltiness,

        and from avenging yourself with your own hand, now therefore

        let your enemies, and those who seek evil to my lord,

        be as Nabal.

025:027 Now this present which your servant has brought to my lord,

        let it be given to the young men who follow my lord.

025:028 Please forgive the trespass of your handmaid:  for Yahweh

        will certainly make my lord a sure house, because my lord

        fights the battles of Yahweh; and evil shall not be found

        in you all your days.

025:029 Though men be risen up to pursue you, and to seek your soul,

        yet the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life

        with Yahweh your God; and the souls of your enemies,

        them shall he sling out, as from the hollow of a sling.

025:030 It shall come to pass, when Yahweh shall have done to my lord

        according to all the good that he has spoken concerning you,

        and shall have appointed you prince over Israel,

025:031 that this shall be no grief to you, nor offense of heart

        to my lord, either that you have shed blood without cause,

        or that my lord has avenged himself.  When Yahweh shall

        have dealt well with my lord, then remember your handmaid.

025:032 David said to Abigail, Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel,

        who sent you this day to meet me:

025:033 and blessed be your discretion, and blessed be you, that have

        kept me this day from blood guiltiness, and from avenging

        myself with my own hand.

025:034 For in very deed, as Yahweh, the God of Israel, lives, who has

        withheld me from hurting you, except you had hurried

        and come to meet me, surely there wouldn't have been left

        to Nabal by the morning light so much as one who urinates

        on a wall.{or, male.}

025:035 So David received of her hand that which she had brought him:

        and he said to her, Go up in peace to your house; behold, I have

        listened to your voice, and have accepted your person.

025:036 Abigail came to Nabal; and behold, he held a feast in his house,

        like the feast of a king; and Nabal's heart was merry within him,

        for he was very drunken:  therefore she told him nothing,

        less or more, until the morning light.

025:037 It happened in the morning, when the wine was gone out of Nabal,

        that his wife told him these things, and his heart died

        within him, and he became as a stone.

025:038 It happened about ten days after, that Yahweh struck Nabal,

        so that he died.

025:039 When David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, Blessed be Yahweh,

        who has pleaded the cause of my reproach from the hand

        of Nabal, and has kept back his servant from evil:

        and the evil-doing of Nabal has Yahweh returned on his own head.

        David sent and spoke concerning Abigail, to take her to

        him as wife.

025:040 When the servants of David were come to Abigail to Carmel,

        they spoke to her, saying, David has sent us to you, to take

        you to him as wife.

025:041 She arose, and bowed herself with her face to the earth,

        and said, Behold, your handmaid is a servant to wash the feet

        of the servants of my lord.

025:042 Abigail hurried, and arose, and rode on a donkey, with five ladies

        of hers who followed her; and she went after the messengers

        of David, and became his wife.

025:043 David also took Ahinoam of Jezreel; and they became both

        of them his wives.

025:044 Now Saul had given Michal his daughter, David's wife,

        to Palti the son of Laish, who was of Gallim.

026:001 The Ziphites came to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Doesn't David hide

        himself in the hill of Hachilah, which is before the desert?

026:002 Then Saul arose, and went down to the wilderness of Ziph,

        having three thousand chosen men of Israel with him, to seek

        David in the wilderness of Ziph.

026:003 Saul encamped in the hill of Hachilah, which is before the desert,

        by the way.  But David abode in the wilderness, and he saw

        that Saul came after him into the wilderness.

026:004 David therefore sent out spies, and understood that Saul was

        come of a certainty.

026:005 David arose, and came to the place where Saul had encamped;

        and David saw the place where Saul lay, and Abner the son of Ner,

        the captain of his army:  and Saul lay within the place

        of the wagons, and the people were encamped round about him.

026:006 Then answered David and said to Ahimelech the Hittite,

        and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother to Joab,

        saying, Who will go down with me to Saul to the camp?

        Abishai said, I will go down with you.

026:007 So David and Abishai came to the people by night:

        and, behold, Saul lay sleeping within the place of the wagons,

        with his spear stuck in the ground at his head; and Abner

        and the people lay round about him.

026:008 Then said Abishai to David, God has delivered up your enemy

        into your hand this day:  now therefore please let me strike

        him with the spear to the earth at one stroke, and I will

        not strike him the second time.

026:009 David said to Abishai, Don't destroy him; for who can put forth

        his hand against Yahweh's anointed, and be guiltless?

026:010 David said, As Yahweh lives, Yahweh will strike him; or his day

        shall come to die; or he shall go down into battle and perish.

026:011 Yahweh forbid that I should put forth my hand against

        Yahweh's anointed:  but now please take the spear that is at

        his head, and the jar of water, and let us go.

026:012 So David took the spear and the jar of water from Saul's head;

        and they got them away:  and no man saw it, nor knew it,

        neither did any awake; for they were all asleep, because a deep

        sleep from Yahweh was fallen on them.

026:013 Then David went over to the other side, and stood on the top

        of the mountain afar off; a great space being between them;

026:014 and David cried to the people, and to Abner the son of Ner,

        saying, Don't you answer, Abner?  Then Abner answered,

        Who are you who cries to the king?

026:015 David said to Abner, Aren't you a [valiant] man? and who is like

        you in Israel? why then have you not kept watch over your lord,

        the king? for there came one of the people in to destroy

        the king your lord.

026:016 This thing isn't good that you have done.  As Yahweh lives,

        you are worthy to die, because you have not kept watch over

        your lord, Yahweh's anointed.  Now see where the king's spear is,

        and the jar of water that was at his head.

026:017 Saul knew David's voice, and said, Is this your voice,

        my son David?  David said, It is my voice, my lord, O king.

026:018 He said, Why does my lord pursue after his servant? for what

        have I done? or what evil is in my hand?

026:019 Now therefore, please let my lord the king hear the words

        of his servant.  If it be Yahweh that has stirred you

        up against me, let him accept an offering:  but if it

        be the children of men, cursed be they before Yahweh:

        for they have driven me out this day that I shouldn't cling

        to Yahweh's inheritance, saying, Go, serve other gods.

026:020 Now therefore, don't let my blood fall to the earth away

        from the presence of Yahweh:  for the king of Israel is

        come out to seek a flea, as when one does hunt a partridge

        in the mountains.

026:021 Then said Saul, I have sinned:  return, my son David;

        for I will no more do you harm, because my life was precious

        in your eyes this day:  behold, I have played the fool,

        and have erred exceedingly.

026:022 David answered, Behold the spear, O king! let then one of

        the young men come over and get it.

026:023 Yahweh will render to every man his righteousness and

        his faithfulness; because Yahweh delivered you into my hand today,

        and I wouldn't put forth my hand against Yahweh's anointed.

026:024 Behold, as your life was much set by this day in my eyes,

        so let my life be much set by in the eyes of Yahweh, and let

        him deliver me out of all oppression.

026:025 Then Saul said to David, Blessed be you, my son David:

        you shall both do mightily, and shall surely prevail.

        So David went his way, and Saul returned to his place.

027:001 David said in his heart, I shall now perish one day by the hand

        of Saul:  there is nothing better for me than that I should

        escape into the land of the Philistines; and Saul will despair

        of me, to seek me any more in all the borders of Israel:

        so shall I escape out of his hand.

027:002 David arose, and passed over, he and the six hundred men

        who were with him, to Achish the son of Maoch, king of Gath.

027:003 David lived with Achish at Gath, he and his men, every man

        with his household, even David with his two wives, Ahinoam

        the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the Carmelitess, Nabal's wife.

027:004 It was told Saul that David was fled to Gath:  and he sought

        no more again for him.

027:005 David said to Achish, If now I have found favor in your eyes,

        let them give me a place in one of the cities in the country,

        that I may dwell there:  for why should your servant dwell

        in the royal city with you?

027:006 Then Achish gave him Ziklag that day:  why Ziklag pertains

        to the kings of Judah to this day.

027:007 The number of the days that David lived in the country

        of the Philistines was a full year and four months.

027:008 David and his men went up, and made a raid on the Geshurites,

        and the Girzites, and the Amalekites; for those [nations] were

        the inhabitants of the land, who were of old, as you go to Shur,

        even to the land of Egypt.

027:009 David struck the land, and saved neither man nor woman alive,

        and took away the sheep, and the oxen, and the donkeys,

        and the camels, and the clothing; and he returned,

        and came to Achish.

027:010 Achish said, Against whom have you made a raid today?

        David said, Against the South of Judah, and against the South

        of the Jerahmeelites, and against the South of the Kenites.

027:011 David saved neither man nor woman alive, to bring them to Gath,

        saying, Lest they should tell of us, saying, So did David,

        and so has been his manner all the while he has lived

        in the country of the Philistines.

027:012 Achish believed David, saying, He has made his people Israel

        utterly to abhor him; therefore he shall be my servant forever.

028:001 It happened in those days, that the Philistines gathered

        their armies together for warfare, to fight with Israel.

        Achish said to David, Know you assuredly, that you shall go

        out with me in the army, you and your men.

028:002 David said to Achish, Therefore you shall know what your servant

        will do.  Achish said to David, Therefore will I make you

        keeper of my head for ever.

028:003 Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him,

        and buried him in Ramah, even in his own city.  Saul had

        put away those who had familiar spirits, and the wizards,

        out of the land.

028:004 The Philistines gathered themselves together, and came and

        encamped in Shunem:  and Saul gathered all Israel together,

        and they encamped in Gilboa.

028:005 When Saul saw the army of the Philistines, he was afraid,

        and his heart trembled greatly.

028:006 When Saul inquired of Yahweh, Yahweh didn't answer him,

        neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets.

028:007 Then said Saul to his servants, Seek me a woman who has

        a familiar spirit, that I may go to her, and inquire of her.

        His servants said to him, Behold, there is a woman who has

        a familiar spirit at Endor.

028:008 Saul disguised himself, and put on other clothing, and went,

        he and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night:

        and he said, Please divine to me by the familiar spirit,

        and bring me up whoever I shall name to you.

028:009 The woman said to him, Behold, you know what Saul has done,

        how he has cut off those who have familiar spirits, and the wizards,

        out of the land:  why then lay you a snare for my life,

        to cause me to die?

028:010 Saul swore to her by Yahweh, saying, As Yahweh lives,

        there shall no punishment happen to you for this thing.

028:011 Then said the woman, Whom shall I bring up to you?

        He said, Bring me up Samuel.

028:012 When the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud voice;

        and the woman spoke to Saul, saying, Why have you deceived

        me? for you are Saul.

028:013 The king said to her, Don't be afraid:  for what do you see?

        The woman said to Saul, I see a god coming up out of the earth.

028:014 He said to her, What form is he of?  She said, An old man

        comes up; and he is covered with a robe.  Saul perceived

        that it was Samuel, and he bowed with his face to the ground,

        and did obeisance.

028:015 Samuel said to Saul, Why have you disquieted me, to bring me up?

        Saul answered, I am sore distressed; for the Philistines

        make war against me, and God is departed from me,

        and answers me no more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams:

        therefore I have called you, that you may make known to me

        what I shall do.

028:016 Samuel said, Why then do you ask of me, seeing Yahweh is departed

        from you, and is become your adversary?

028:017 Yahweh has done to you, as he spoke by me:  and Yahweh has torn

        the kingdom out of your hand, and given it to your neighbor,

        even to David.

028:018 Because you didn't obey the voice of Yahweh, and didn't execute

        his fierce wrath on Amalek, therefore has Yahweh done this

        thing to you this day.

028:019 Moreover Yahweh will deliver Israel also with you into the hand

        of the Philistines; and tomorrow shall you and your sons be with me:

        Yahweh will deliver the army of Israel also into the hand

        of the Philistines.

028:020 Then Saul fell immediately his full length on the earth,

        and was sore afraid, because of the words of Samuel:

        and there was no strength in him; for he had eaten no bread

        all the day, nor all the night.

028:021 The woman came to Saul, and saw that he was sore troubled,

        and said to him, Behold, your handmaid has listened to your voice,

        and I have put my life in my hand, and have listened to your

        words which you spoke to me.

028:022 Now therefore, please listen also to the voice of your handmaid,

        and let me set a morsel of bread before you; and eat,

        that you may have strength, when you go on your way.

028:023 But he refused, and said, I will not eat.  But his servants,

        together with the woman, constrained him; and he listened

        to their voice.  So he arose from the earth, and sat on the bed.

028:024 The woman had a fattened calf in the house; and she hurried,

        and killed it; and she took flour, and kneaded it, and did

        bake unleavened bread of it:

028:025 and she brought it before Saul, and before his servants;

        and they ate.  Then they rose up, and went away that night.

029:001 Now the Philistines gathered together all their armies to Aphek:

        and the Israelites encamped by the spring which is in Jezreel.

029:002 The lords of the Philistines passed on by hundreds, and by thousands;

        and David and his men passed on in the rearward with Achish.

029:003 Then said the princes of the Philistines, What [do]

        these Hebrews [here]?  Achish said to the princes of

        the Philistines, Isn't this David, the servant of Saul the king

        of Israel, who has been with me these days, or [rather]

        these years, and I have found no fault in him since he fell

        away [to me] to this day?

029:004 But the princes of the Philistines were angry with him;

        and the princes of the Philistines said to him,

        Make the man return, that he may go back to his place

        where you have appointed him, and let him not go down with us

        to battle, lest in the battle he become an adversary to us:

        for with what should this [fellow] reconcile himself to his

        lord? should it not be with the heads of these men?

029:005 Is not this David, of whom they sang one to another in dances,

        saying, Saul has slain his thousands, David his ten thousands?

029:006 Then Achish called David, and said to him, As Yahweh lives,

        you have been upright, and your going out and your coming

        in with me in the army is good in my sight; for I have not found

        evil in you since the day of your coming to me to this day:

        nevertheless the lords don't favor you.

029:007 Therefore now return, and go in peace, that you not displease

        the lords of the Philistines.

029:008 David said to Achish, But what have I done? and what have you

        found in your servant so long as I have been before you

        to this day, that I may not go and fight against the enemies

        of my lord the king?

029:009 Achish answered David, I know that you are good in my sight,

        as an angel of God:  notwithstanding the princes of the Philistines

        have said, He shall not go up with us to the battle.

029:010 Therefore now rise up early in the morning with the servants

        of your lord who have come with you; and as soon as you are up

        early in the morning, and have light, depart.

029:011 So David rose up early, he and his men, to depart in

        the morning, to return into the land of the Philistines.

        The Philistines went up to Jezreel.

030:001 It happened, when David and his men were come to Ziklag on

        the third day, that the Amalekites had made a raid on the South,

        and on Ziklag, and had struck Ziklag, and burned it with fire,

030:002 and had taken captive the women [and all] who were therein,

        both small and great:  they didn't kill any, but carried them off,

        and went their way.

030:003 When David and his men came to the city, behold, it was burned

        with fire; and their wives, and their sons, and their daughters,

        were taken captive.

030:004 Then David and the people who were with him lifted up their

        voice and wept, until they had no more power to weep.

030:005 David's two wives were taken captive, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess,

        and Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.

030:006 David was greatly distressed; for the people spoke of stoning him,

        because the soul of all the people was grieved, every man

        for his sons and for his daughters:  but David strengthened

        himself in Yahweh his God.

030:007 David said to Abiathar the priest, the son of Ahimelech, Please bring

        me here the ephod.  Abiathar brought there the ephod to David.

030:008 David inquired of Yahweh, saying, If I pursue after this troop,

        shall I overtake them?  He answered him, Pursue; for you shall

        surely overtake [them], and shall without fail recover [all].

030:009 So David went, he and the six hundred men who were with him,

        and came to the brook Besor, where those who were

        left behind stayed.

030:010 But David pursued, he and four hundred men; for two hundred

        stayed behind, who were so faint that they couldn't go over

        the brook Besor.

030:011 They found an Egyptian in the field, and brought him to David,

        and gave him bread, and he ate; and they gave him water to drink.

030:012 They gave him a piece of a cake of figs, and two clusters of raisins:

        and when he had eaten, his spirit came again to him;

        for he had eaten no bread, nor drunk any water, three days

        and three nights.

030:013 David said to him, To whom belong you? and whence are you?

        He said, I am a young man of Egypt, servant to an Amalekite;

        and my master left me, because three days ago I fell sick.

030:014 We made a raid on the South of the Cherethites, and on

        that which belongs to Judah, and on the South of Caleb;

        and we burned Ziklag with fire.

030:015 David said to him, Will you bring me down to this troop?

        He said, Swear to me by God, that you will neither kill me,

        nor deliver me up into the hands of my master, and I will bring

        you down to this troop.

030:016 When he had brought him down, behold, they were spread abroad

        over all the ground, eating and drinking, and dancing,

        because of all the great spoil that they had taken out of

        the land of the Philistines, and out of the land of Judah.

030:017 David struck them from the twilight even to the evening

        of the next day:  and there not a man of them escaped,

        except four hundred young men, who rode on camels and fled.

030:018 David recovered all that the Amalekites had taken; and David

        rescued his two wives.

030:019 There was nothing lacking to them, neither small nor great,

        neither sons nor daughters, neither spoil, nor anything

        that they had taken to them:  David brought back all.

030:020 David took all the flocks and the herds, [which] they drove

        before those [other] livestock, and said, This is David's spoil.

030:021 David came to the two hundred men, who were so faint that they

        could not follow David, whom also they had made to abide

        at the brook Besor; and they went forth to meet David,

        and to meet the people who were with him:  and when David

        came near to the people, he greeted them.

030:022 Then answered all the wicked men and base fellows, of those who

        went with David, and said, Because they didn't go with us,

        we will not give them anything of the spoil that we

        have recovered, except to every man his wife and his children,

        that he may lead them away, and depart.

030:023 Then said David, You shall not do so, my brothers,

        with that which Yahweh has given to us, who has preserved us,

        and delivered the troop that came against us into our hand.

030:024 Who will listen to you in this matter? for as his share is

        who goes down to the battle, so shall his share be who tarries

        by the baggage:  they shall share alike.

030:025 It was so from that day forward, that he made it a statute

        and an ordinance for Israel to this day.

030:026 When David came to Ziklag, he sent of the spoil to the elders

        of Judah, even to his friends, saying, Behold, a present

        for you of the spoil of the enemies of Yahweh:

030:027 To those who were in Bethel, and to those who were in Ramoth

        of the South, and to those who were in Jattir,

030:028 and to those who were in Aroer, and to those who were in Siphmoth,

        and to those who were in Eshtemoa,

030:029 and to those who were in Racal, and to those who were in the cities

        of the Jerahmeelites, and to those who were in the cities

        of the Kenites,

030:030 and to those who were in Hormah, and to those who were in Borashan,

        and to those who were in Athach,

030:031 and to those who were in Hebron, and to all the places where

        David himself and his men used to stay.

031:001 Now the Philistines fought against Israel:  and the men of

        Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain

        on Mount Gilboa.

031:002 The Philistines followed hard on Saul and on his sons;

        and the Philistines killed Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Malchishua,

        the sons of Saul.

031:003 The battle went sore against Saul, and the archers overtook him;

        and he was greatly distressed by reason of the archers.

031:004 Then said Saul to his armor bearer, Draw your sword, and thrust

        me through therewith, lest these uncircumcised come and thrust

        me through, and abuse me.  But his armor bearer would not;

        for he was sore afraid.  Therefore Saul took his sword,

        and fell on it.

031:005 When his armor bearer saw that Saul was dead, he likewise fell

        on his sword, and died with him.

031:006 So Saul died, and his three sons, and his armor bearer,

        and all his men, that same day together.

031:007 When the men of Israel who were on the other side of the valley,

        and those who were beyond the Jordan, saw that the men

        of Israel fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead,

        they forsook the cities, and fled; and the Philistines came

        and lived in them.

031:008 It happened on the next day, when the Philistines came to strip

        the slain, that they found Saul and his three sons fallen

        on Mount Gilboa.

031:009 They cut off his head, and stripped off his armor, and sent

        into the land of the Philistines round about, to carry the news

        to the house of their idols, and to the people.

031:010 They put his armor in the house of the Ashtaroth; and they

        fastened his body to the wall of Beth Shan.

031:011 When the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead heard concerning him

        that which the Philistines had done to Saul,

031:012 all the valiant men arose, and went all night, and took the body

        of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Beth Shan;

        and they came to Jabesh, and burnt them there.

031:013 They took their bones, and buried them under the tamarisk tree

        in Jabesh, and fasted seven days.
